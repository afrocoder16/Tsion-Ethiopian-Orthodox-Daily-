and he rose up to salute his father and his mother before he\ndeparted.  And they wept over him, and they would not let him go until the angel of the\nLord came a second time and brought him out from his city and took him to the city of\nGemwa Tuw.  When he arrived there, he found that the governor was in the bath house,\nbut as soon as he came out the saint cried out boldly before him, saying, “I am a Christian. \nI believe on our Lord Jesus Christ.”  And the governor commanded one of his soldiers to\ntake Saint Isaac with him to his house, and to guard him until he came back from the city\nof Nakyos.  And as Saint Isaac was passing along the road with the soldier, a certain blind\nman, who was sitting by the wayside, begged him, saying, “Have compassion upon me, O\nsaint of God, and heal my eyes.”  And Saint Abba Isaac petitioned God for the blind man,\nand his eyes were opened immediately.  When the soldier saw this miracle he believed on\nour Lord Jesus Christ, and became a Christian.   And when the governor returned, the\nsoldier confessed the Lord Jesus Christ before him, and received the crown of martyrdom. \nAfter this the governor tortured this saint very severely, and he sent him to the city of\nBehnesa [to suffer] divers tortures.  And when the saint was on the ship he begged that\nsomeone might give him a cup of water, and a certain sailor, who was blind in one eye,\ngave him a cup of water; and the saint sprinkled some of the water over him, and his eye\nwas opened, like its fellow.  And when the men of the city of Behnesa saw the tortures\nwhich were inflicted on Saint Abba Isaac, and the mighty signs which he performed, they\ntook him and carried him to the governor, and said unto him, “kill he, or send him away;\nact quickly and immediately.”  And straightway the governor commanded the soldiers to\ncut off his head, and they cut off his head with a sword, and he received the crown of life. \nAnd there were there certain believing men, and they lifted the body of Saint Abba Isaac\nupon a wagon, and they drew it with oxen, and brought it to the city of Dafra.  And when\nthey could not find a boat to carry it over the river, the oxen forded the river, carrying the\nbody of the saint upon their backs, and the believers brought it into his house.  And they\npulled down the church, and built another church in his name, and they laid the body\ntherein, and many signs and miracles took place [there] through it.  Salutation to Isaac.\nAnd on this day also died the holy and honored father Abba Macarius, the Alexandrian\npriest.  This holy man lived in the days of the honorable Saint Abba Macarius the Great; he\nwas the father of the monastery of Scete, and performed many excellent deeds therein.  It\nis said of him that a gnat stung him and he killed it, and he repented and reproached\nhimself for having killed it.  And he went down to the valley which was in the desert, and\nhe exposed his body to the gnats, and remained there for six months, when his body was\nlike unto that of a man suffering from elephantiasis.   And he returned to his cell, and\nnobody recognized him as Abba Macarius.  One day he stood up in prayer for five days\nand five nights, with his heart in heaven, until the Satans burned him.  This labor, and this\nfight, was the greatest of all the excellent things which he performed.  One day he wanted\nto see the regions which were beyond the range of his vision.  And he went out into the\ndesert, and lived there, and wandered about for ten days, and he had with him some reeds\nwhich he intended to place [at intervals] on the road, to serve as guide marks when he\nreturned so that he might not lose his way; when he drew near the place he sought, he felt\nweary, and lay down to rest a little, and Satan plucked the reeds from him as he slept, and\ntied them round the head of the saint.  When Abba Macarius woke up from his sleep, he\nlooked about for the reeds and missed them, and straightway he marveled.  And he heard a\nvoice, saying, “O Macarius, if thou hast faith put not [thy] trust in reeds, but believe that\nthe same pillar of cloud which guided the children of Israel will also guide thee.”  And\n\nwhen the saint had seen the district round about, he turned back and became thirsty on the\nroad; and God sent to him a she-buffalo of the desert, and he drank of her milk until he\nwas wholly satisfied, and returned to his cell.  One day a she-wolf came to him, and seized\nhis garment, and pulled him along, and he followed her to her den, and she brought out her\nyoung ones to him, and looking at them he found that their eyes were blind, and he\nmarveled at the sagacity of the beast.  And he took the cubs in his hand, and cried out, and\nspat into their eyes, and made the sign of the Life-giving Cross over them, and the cubs\nwere healed immediately, and they ran after their mother and sucked her milk, and they\nfollowed her until they went into her den.  And after this the wolf returned to the saint, and\nbrought him a sheep’s skin and he kept it by him, and slept upon it until the time of his\ndeath.  One day he changed his apparel after the manner of the laity, and he went to the\nmonastery of Saint Abba Pachomius, and stood for four days during the Great Fast,\nwithout eating, or drinking, or sitting down, and he cried out “Hosanna” as he stood.  And\nthe monks said unto Abba Pachomius, “Cast out this man from us, for he is not human.” \nAnd Abba Pachomius said unto them, “Have patience with me until I can ask God to show\nme his work”; and when he had asked God concerning him He told him that he was\nMacarius the Alexandrian.  And straightway Saint Abba Pachomius went to him, and with\nhim went all the monks, and they embraced him and were blessed by him, and they\nrejoiced in him with a great joy.  And when those who were magnifying themselves in the\nmonastery of Saint Abba Pachomius saw the grace of this Saint Abba Macarius they\nbecame humble; and after this Macarius returned to his cell in the desert of Scete.  And\nwhen rain was withheld, and no rain fell upon the city of Alexandria, the Archbishop Abba\nTimothy sent to him, and asked him to come to him to the city of Alexandria to pray with\nhim to God to make rain to fall, and to destroy the locusts.  And he rose up and went with\nthe messengers to the city of Alexandria, and the people received him with great joy, and\nhe prayed in his heart secretly, and a great rain fell, and it continued to rain for two days\nand for two nights in such torrents, that men began to think that the earth would be\ndestroyed by overmuch rain.  And Saint Abba Macarius said unto the archbishop, “Why\ndid ye bring me hither?”  And he answered and said unto him, “The people made us bring\nthee to pray for us to God, that He might bring down the rain upon us, and that we all\nmight not perish.”  And straightway he prayed, and the rain ceased, and the sun appeared\nin the sky by the might of God.   And this father performed many great and excellent\nworks, and God made manifest many signs and wonders by his hands, and he healed many\nmen in whom there were unclean spirits.  And he used to say when he was performing\nsome good deed that men ought to know how to do the good deeds which he did now; the\ngood deeds which he did were innumerable.  When he heard that any man did some good\ndeed he never slept until he had done a similar good deed.  And having finished his fight,\nhe died in peace at a good old age; and he remained eight years without spitting on the\nground for the sake of the honor of the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And all\nthe days of his life were one hundred years.  Salutation to Macarius the Alexandrian.\nAnd on this day also Bandela’an (Pantleon), the father of Saint Isidore, became a martyr.\nAnd on this day also died Amon the Just, who refused the office of bishop, saying, “It is\nbetter for me to acquire the practice of the ascetic life.”  [Wanting in the Bodleian MS.]\nAnd on this day also Saint Dilagi (Pelagia), and her four sons, whose names were Sures,\nand Kherman, and Yanufa, and Santonya, became martyrs.  This holy woman was strong\nin the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, and when Arianus the governor of the city of Ensena\ncame, she met him, and said unto him, “O Arianus, the governor, I am a Christian, and a\nbeliever on my Lord Jesus Christ, Who created the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and\nall that therein is.”  And her children also cried out boldly, saying, “We are Christians, and\nfollowers of the Messiah.”  When the governor heard this he was wroth and he cut off their\nheads with the sword, and they finished their martyrdom, and delivered up their souls as\nmissives to our Lord Jesus Christ.  Salutation of Dilagi and her children.\nAnd on this day also died Saint Salome, the mistress of purity and holiness, and the\ndevotee of virginity.  This holy woman came from the city of Warab; her parents were\nGod-fearing folk and they brought her up piously.   When she grew up, a certain man\n\nbetrothed her to himself, and he brought her into the state of marriage against her will, and\nhe wished to have union with her, but straightway the power of God prevented him, and it\nsmote him in his flesh, and he was not able to approach her.  And whilst matters were thus\nshe hid herself.  And she departed by night, and was carried away by the power of God,\nand she continued to go about visiting all the saints, and she asked God day and night,\nwith fasting and with prayer, to direct her into the right path.  And God heard her petition,\nand by the Divine Will she came to Dabra Libanos, and took the garb of the ascetic life,\nthat is to say the Law of the angels, through John Kama.  And she fought many fights,\nwhich would terrify hearts, and she followed that life of the fathers with fasting and with\nprayers, and with every kind of praiseworthy gift.  At length she was able to work many\nmiracles, even as it is written in the book describing her fight; and then she died on the\nsixth day of Genbot.  Salutation to Salome.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Dionysius who finished his fight by the edge of\nthe chopper, and the Samaritan woman [Pelagia].  Salutation to Dionysius, the teacher of\nIsaac.\nSalutation to Sinoda, the chief of the anchorites.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

And when forty\ndays were ended after His Resurrection, He ascended into the heavens, seated upon the\nwings of the Cherubim, and the Seraphim, and the wings of the winds.  And the prophecy\nof David was fulfilled, saying, “He mounted upon the Cherubim, and did fly on the wings\nof the wind” (Psalm xviii, 10).   And by this Ascension those who believed on Him\nunderstood ascension into the heavens, and into the celestial habitation; for wherever the\nhead is, it is meet that the members should be also.  And as the old Adam dwelt first in the\ninheritance of the earth, and then in the Seol, so also the second Adam dwelt in the\ninheritance of the kingdom of the heavens, and sat down at the great right hand in the\nheights of the heavens.  And our Lord Christ did not make His Ascension to follow His\nResurrection immediately, in order that the heretics might not think and say that the\nAscension was an inferior matter; but out Lord, in the operation of His wisdom, waited\nforty days after His Resurrection, and strengthened the faintheartedness of His disciples,\n\nand made their souls to understand His Resurrection.   And the prophecy of Daniel the\nprophet concerning the Resurrection of our Lord was fulfilled, saying, “I saw as it were\nthe Son of Man coming upon the cloud of heaven until He drew near the Ancient of Days. \nAnd He gave Him authority, and sovereignty, and honor so that every nation, and people,\nand tongue should worship Him.  And His authority is an everlasting authority, and His\nsovereignty unending “ (Daniel viii, 13, 15), to Whom with His Good Father and the Life-\ngiving Holy Spirit be glory for ever and ever.  Amen.  Salutation to Thy Ascension to Thy\nFather, Thou didst return like a warrior bringing his spoil with him.  Salutation with praise,\nand singing, and music, to Thy Ascension.  Salutation to the Protector of Adam, Who, as\nDavid saith, “Went up with the sound of the trumpet” (Psalm 47:5).\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Daniel, abbot of the desert of Scete.  This\nholy and just man was pure and perfect.  And when his fame was noised abroad the lady\nAnatasia came to him wearing the apparel of her exalted rank, and she became a nun, and\nlived in a cell near him for eight and twenty years; and no man knew that she was a\nwoman.   And this holy man saw a certain man whose name was Eulogius, and who\nworked stones for a karat of gold each day; upon a very small portion of this he lived, and\nwith the remainder he fed the poor and needy, and what food they left he gave to the dogs. \nAnd he never saved anything for the morrow.  And when the holy man saw his good fight,\nand the excellence of his deeds, he asked God to give Ewlhis worldly goods so that he\nmight increase his good works and charities therewith; and then he became surety for\nEulogius.  And as Eulogius was working stone in the quarry, he found a deposit of stones\nof gold, and he took them, and departed to the city of Constantinople, where he became a\ngreat officer of the emperor; and he forsook the good trade at which he formerly worked. \nAnd when Saint Abba Daniel heard about him, he went to the city of Constantinople, and\nhe saw that Eulogius had become a great officer, and that he rode a horse with great pride,\nand that many soldiers surrounded him, and that he had abandoned his good trade.  Then\nthe saint saw a vision wherein our Lord Jesus Christ was sitting and judging men, and He\ncommanded [His angels] to hang Saint Abba Daniel, and they demanded from him the\nsoul of Eulogius; and he saw how our Lady Mary entreated our Lord Jesus Christ on his\nbehalf.   And straightway the holy man awoke from his sleep, and he returned to his\nmonastery and entreated God on behalf of Eulogius, that He would bring him back to his\nformer state of poverty.  And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him, and rebuked him\nfor daring [to interfere with] God concerning His judgment of His creation.  And after this\nthe Emperor Constantine died, and another emperor reigned in his stead; and he rose up\nagainst Eulogius, and took away all his goods, and wanted to kill him.  And Eulogius fled\nfrom him in order to save his life, and he came to his native city, and worked stone in the\nquarry as formerly.  And Saint Abba Daniel came back to him, and told him how one had\nhanged him instead of him in the vision, and how one had demanded his soul from him. \nAnd the spirit of prophecy was upon this holy man, and God made manifest many signs\nand wonders through him.  And when the heretics tried to make him to go forth from the\nTrue Faith he refused, and he seized the roll wherein was [written] the [unclean] Faith and\ntore it up; and the officer of the emperor punished him very severely.  And after this when\nGod willed to give him rest, He sent to him His angel who informed him of the time of his\ndeparture from this world; and he gathered together the monks, and commanded them, and\nstrengthened them, and comforted them, and he died in peace.  Salutation to Daniel who\ngave sight to the blind when they washed in the water wherein he had bathed his feet.\nAnd on this day also Saint Maximus, the fighter, became a martyr.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and they asked the chief officer to give them\npermission not to eat food made of flesh, but to give them pottage and herbs.  And the\nchief officer said unto them, “[If I do] I am afraid that I shall change the goodly\nappearance of your persons, and be destroyed by the king”; and they answered and said\nunto him, “Give us a trial, and if our persons remain goodly in appearance, well, and if\nthey do not, then do what thou wishest.”  And then they lived upon pottage, and their faces\nshone, and were exceedingly godly in appearance, by the grace of God.  And the king\nloved them very much, and appointed them governors over all the land of Babylon.  And\nwhen the king made an image of gold, he commanded all men to worship it, and when the\nThree Holy Children would not bow down to it, those who were envious of them laid\ninformation against them before the king.  And Nebuchadnezzar had them brought before\nhim and he questioned them about it, and they confessed before him, saying, “We will not\nbow down to the image of gold which thou hast made.”  And the king was wroth, and he\ncommanded his soldiers to cast them into a furnace (or, oven) which was heated, [and they\ndid so]; and God sent His angel who extinguished the fire and made the flame of fire to be\nlike cool dew at the dawn of day, after the flame had risen to a height of nine and forty\ncubits, and had consumed those who were outside the furnace.  And the fire did not injure\nthe Three Holy Children in the least degree.  When the king saw this he believed on the\nGod of heaven, and he added to their honor and to the height of their position, and he\npromoted them in their offices.  And when the tenth day of Genbot came, and they were\npraying in their cell, having bowed down they delivered their souls into the hand of God. \nAnd at that moment there was a great earthquake in the city of Babylon, and\nNebuchadnezzar was afraid, and asked Daniel the prophet about it, saying, “Why hath this\ngreat earthquake taken place?”  And Daniel made known to the king, saying, “It is because\nthese Three Holy Children have died.”   And one came to the king . . . and the king\nsorrowed for them with a great sorrow, and he commanded [his men] to make three coffins\nof the bones of the rhinoceros, and they swathed the Three Children in silks and in cloths\nworked with gold, and they laid the saints [in the coffins] and did as the king commanded. \nAnd he also commanded [his men] to make for him a coffin of gold, so that when he died\nthey might place his body therein, and lay it with the bodies of the saints; and even so it\nwas [done].  And in the days of the father Abba Theophilus, Archbishop of the city of\nAlexandria, they built a church in their name, and he wished to make men bring their\nbodies to that church, [from Babylon]; and he sent Abba John, the Short, to make them\nbring their bodies.   And when John came into the city of Babylon he saw the rivers\nthereof, but there was no one at all in it; and the image of gold rested there.  And the angel\nof the Lord brought him to the bodies of the saints, and the body of the king was lying\nwith them; and he bowed down before the bodies of the saints.  And he prayed and wept,\nsaying, “O my holy fathers, our father Abba Theophilus the archbishop hath built a church\nin your names, and he wisheth to bring your bodies into it; and he hath sent me [to effect\nthis].”  And a voice went forth from their bodies, saying, “God give thee a reward for thy\nlabor.  Say thou to the father of the Faith, Abba Theophilus, that God hath commanded us\nnot to let our bodies be separated from the body of this king until the Day of Judgment. \nBut we do not wish that his labor should be wasted.  Tell him to command lamps to be\nsuspended in the church on the night of the festival of its dedication, and let the servants\n\nput no oil therein; and they shall not light [the wicks], and we will come into the church\nand make manifest our power therein.”  And when Abba John, the Short, returned to the\narchbishop, he told him everything, and what they said to him, and what they commanded\nhim to do; and the archbishop did as the Three Holy Children commanded.  And on the\nnight of the tenth day of the month of Genbot, the saints appeared in the church, and\nlighted the lamps with fire.  And the archbishop and those who were worthy saw the Three\nHoly Children going round about the church, and a very large number of sick folk were\nstraightway healed of their sicknesses, whatsoever the sickness of each of them might be,\nby the Three Holy Children.  Salutation to the Three Children who on the night of the\ndedication of their church in Alexandria lighted the lamps, which had been hung up therein\nwithout any oil in them.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Thecla the martyr, and Paula.\nAnd on this day also died Abraham, the artisan.  This saint was a man from the city of\nMarkyas (Marcia), and from the monastery, which was called the monastery of the martyr\nTheodore.  And the mother of the child gave him to the teacher so that he might learn the\nFaith of our Lord Christ; and God opened the eyes of his heart, and he learned all the Law\nof the Church, and began to fast and to pray.  When he was nine years old, he learned the\ncraft of the stone cutter, and he made stone bases, and water troughs (?), whereby he made\nmuch money; and he gave alms to the poor and needy.  One night when he was praying, he\nremembered the end of the world, and of all that is therein, and he wished to become a\nmartyr for the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And straightway the angel of the Lord\nappeared unto him, and gave him the salutation of “Peace,” and he said unto him, “Be\nstrong and fear not, for thou shalt overcome thine enemy and shalt receive the crown of\nmartyrdom.”   Then he went to the church of Saint Theodore, and received Christian\nbaptism, and he stood up before the picture of the saint, and he prayed for a long time, and\ncommitted himself to his care; then he departed to the governor and confessed that he was\na Christian.   And straightway the governor tied his hands behind his back with heavy\npieces of wood attached, and then threw him out in the sun [to suffer] hunger and thirst. \nAnd at midnight our Lord appeared unto him, and gave him the promise concerning the\nman who should call upon his name, or celebrate his commemoration.  Then the governor\ncommanded his soldiers to cut off his head, and when they cut off his head, it flew up in\nthe air above the people assembled there, and cried out three times, “I am a Christian”; and\nit went a distance of fifty cubits and fell into the river.  Then they slit open his belly, and\nfilled it with pitch, and bitumen, and boiling oil, and cast his body into a red-hot furnace,\nand it suffered no injury whatsoever.  Then they cut the body into small pieces, and put\nthem into a basket, and cast them into the river, and by the Will of God his body appeared\nat the edge of the city of Esna, with its head joined thereto; and certain believing men took\nit, and buried it with great honor.  Salutation to Abraham.\nAnd on this day also is celebrated the consecration of the church of Abba Misael.  The\nparents of this saint were rich Christians, and as they lacked a son they prayed to God for\none, and they begot this saint; and when he grew up they taught him the Books of the\nChurch.  When his parents died, the bishop of the city took care of him. When the boy was\ntwelve years old he remembered the end of the world, and he went to the monastery of\nAbba Isaac, and asked the abbot to be allowed to become a monk; and after Abba Isaac\nhad tried him, and seen his holiness, he made him a monk.  And the grace of the Holy\nSpirit descended upon him, and he devoted himself so greatly to fasting and prayer, that\nthe light of his face was changed, and his body became like dry wood.  One day he went\ninto the cell of Abba Isaac, and when the abbot saw that his face had become like that of a\ndead man, he wept and said unto him, “How didst thou destroy thyself in this fashion?” \nAnd the holy Abba Misael (Michael ?) said unto him, “Weep not, O my father, for God\nhath not forsaken me, and my strength is not exhausted by standing up; but this I will tell\nthee.  I saw in my dream as it were envoys of the emperor coming to thee from Alexandria,\nand seeking for me; do not prevent them, so that they may not harm thee.  And in the\ncoming year a great famine shall take place, and lay waste the land; gather together food\nfor thy children.”  And after a few [days] men came in the form of soldiers of the emperor,\nand they seized Abba Isaac whilst seeking for Misael (Michael ?), and when they knew\n\nwhich was he, they took him with them, and they left the monks sorrowing.  When the\nfamine came, and the governor [knew] that there was food in that monastery he wished to\nattack [the monks therein].  And Abba Isaac went out in order to make entreaty to him, and\nimmediately there came forth from the desert many soldiers with swords and drove away\nthe governor.   And whilst Abba Isaac was wondering about these men, Abba Misael\n(Michael ?) came to him, and revealed himself to him, and told him that these men were\nsoldiers of heaven, and that the city whereto they had taken him was the heavenly\nJerusalem.  And then he commanded them to build a church for him in the form of his cell,\nand they consecrated it, as it were this day.  And Abba Misael (Michael ?) appeared to\nAbba Isaac, and told him that he would die the following year, and so it happened, even\naccording to his word.  Salutation to Abba Misael (Michael ?).\nAnd on this day also three hundred and fifty-eight people were martyred with Abba Nob.\nAnd on this day also died John, the patriarch.  Salutation to John the patriarch, who\nlabored at dawn, and fought at even (i.e. performed manual labor by day, and contended\nwith devils during the night).\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and the angel of the Lord appeared unto her and healed her\nwounds.  And when the prisoners and the other people saw her, many of them marveled,\nand believed on our Lord Jesus Christ, and became martyrs.  And when the time of the\ndeath of Saint Theocleia drew nigh, the angel of the Lord appeared unto her, and\ncomforted her and promised her many things.  Then the governor commanded the soldiers\nto cut off her head with the sword, and they cut off her head with the sword and she\nreceived the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  And certain believing\nmen came and gave silver to the soldiers, and they took her holy body, and swathed it for\nburial in costly cloths and laid it in a coffin until the end of the days of the persecution. \nSalutation to Theocleia.\nAnd on this day also is the commemoration of Saint Pafnotyos (Paphnutius), the bishop. \nThis father became a monk in his youth, in the desert of Scete, in the monastery of Abba\nMacarius, and he fought a great fight and performed many works of ascetic virtue.  He\nfasted very often, and never ate food cooked by fire, and ate only dried herbs.  And he\nlearned in the desert the knowledge of the Canon, [and] the Scriptures, and the Law of the\nChurch, and he was appointed priest.  He lived in the desert for five and thirty years, and\nthe report of him and his righteousness was noised abroad.   And Abba Philotheus,\nArchbishop of the city of Alexandria, sent and had him brought to him, and made him a\nbishop.  When he was appointed bishop he never changed his apparel, except when he\nwished to officiate at the Offering, and then he wore the vestments of a priest; and when\nhe had finished the office of the Offering he put on his sackcloth again.  And his spiritual\nfighting and asceticism were so intense, now he followed the canon of the ascetic life all\nday long, that his body languished, and he prayed to God, saying, “O my Lord Jesus\nChrist, unto Whom praise belongeth, wilt Thou withhold Thy grace from me because of\nmy office of bishop?”  And the angel of the Lord came and said unto him, “Know thou that\nwhen thou wast in the desert thou hadst none near thee to visit thee in the time of thy\nsickness, and there was none to minister unto thee, and thou wast not able to find relief\nfrom thy sickness, and it was God Who removed sickness and toil from thy body.  And\nbehold, thou art now here in the world, and thou hast near thee those who can minister\nunto thee and visit thee; and thou canst obtain relief from thy sickness, and canst attend to\nthyself as thou wishest.”   And this father sat in his office of bishop for two and thirty\nyears, and when the time of his death drew nigh he summoned the priest, and the chief\nJews and the deacons, and he handed over to them the sacred property of the churches, and\nall their possessions, and he said unto them, “Behold, know ye that I am departing to God,\nand ye know that I have walked in your midst in a manner which was befitting.  And our\nLord Jesus Christ, before Whom I am about to stand, will be witness for me, that I have\nnot taken for myself one silver drachma of all the money which came to me to the bishop’s\noffice.”  And they embraced him and wept and asked him to bless them, and not to forget\nto help them; and he blessed them, and said unto them, “God bless you and make you\n\nstrong in the True Faith until ye draw your last breath”; and thus saying he fell asleep and\ndied in peace.  Salutation to Pafnotyos (Paphnutius), the bishop.\nAnd on this day also became a martyr Abba Asher, the teacher of Bali, as he was going\ndown to Jerusalem in the time of Wanag Sagad (died A.D. 1540) the king.  He worshipped\nbefore they cut off his head with the sword, and afterwards they burnt him in the fire, at\nthe gates of Jerusalem, at the place where the foot of our Lord stood.\nAnd on this day also died Yared, the poet and hymn writer, who was like unto the\nSeraphim.  This man was a kinsman of Abba Gideon a priest of ‘Aksum, which city held\nthe first church that was built in the country of Ethiopia, and in [this church] was first\npreached the Faith of our Lord Christ, and it was consecrated (i.e. dedicated) in the name\nof our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer.  When this Abba Gideon began to teach\nthe blessed Yared the Psalms of David, he was unable to keep him with him for many days\nat a time, and then when he beat him, and made him to suffer pain, he fled into the desert\nand took up his abode under a tree.  And he saw a worm (caterpillar ?) which was climbing\nup the tree, and when it had climbed up half way it fell down upon the ground; and this it\ndid many times, because of the difficulty of climbing the tree.  And when Saint Yared saw\nthe perseverance (?) of the worm, he repented in his soul and returned to his teacher and\nsaid unto him, “Forgive me, O father, and dispose of me as thou wishest.”   And his\nteacher, a spiritual man, received him, and having asked God with tears He opened the\nthoughts of Yared’s understanding, and he learned in one day the Books of the Old and the\nNew Testaments; and then he was made a deacon.  Now in those days there was no singing\nof hymns and spiritual songs in a loud voice to well-defined tunes, but men murmured \nthem in a low voice.  And God, wishing to raise up to Himself a memorial, sent unto him\nthree birds from the Garden of ‘Edom, and they held converse with Yard in the speech of\nman, and they caught him up, and took him to the heavenly Jerusalem, and there he\nlearned the songs of the Four and Twenty Priests of heaven.  And when he returned to\nhimself, he went into the First Church in ‘Aksum, at the third hour of the day, and he cried\nout with a loud voice, saying, “Hallelujah to the Father, Hallelujah to the Son, Hallelujah\nto the Holy Spirit.”  The first Hallelujah he made the foundation, and called it “Zion.”  In\nthe second Hallelujah he showed forth how Moses carried out the work of the Tabernacle,\nand this he called a “Song of the heights.”  And when they heard the sound of his voice,\nthe king, and the queen, and the bishop, and the priests, and the king’s nobles, ran to the\nchurch, and they spent the day in listening to him.  And he arranged hymns for each season\nof the year, for summer and winter, and spring and autumn, and for festivals and Sabbaths,\nand for the days of the Angels, the Prophets, the Martyrs and the Righteous, in three\nmodes, that is to say, the first mode to be used on ordinary days, the second mode to be\nused on fast days and days of mourning, and the third mode to be used on the great\nfestivals.  And there were not lacking (?) in these three modes any of the sounds that are\nmade by men, and birds, and beasts.   One day whilst Saint Yared was singing by the\nfootstool of King Gebre Meskel, the king (died A.D. 1344) was so deeply absorbed [in\nlistening to] his voice, that he drove his spear into the flat part of Yared’s foot with such\nforce that much blood spurted out; but Saint Yared did not know of it until he had finished\nhis song.  And when the king saw this he was dismayed, and he drew his spear out of his\nfoot, and said unto him, “Ask me what ever reward thou wishest for in return for this thy\nblood which hath been shed”; and Saint Yared said unto him, “Swear to me that thou wilt\nnot refuse me.”  And when the king had sworn Saint Yared said unto him, “Send me away\nthat I may become a monk.”  When the king heard this he was exceedingly sad, and his\nnobles likewise, but he was afraid to prevent him because of his oath.  And when Saint\nYared had gone into the church, he stood before the Tabernacle of Zion, and when he had\nsaid the prayer from the beginning, “Holy, and honorable, and glorious, and blessed, and\npraised, and exalted” to the end thereof, he was raised above the ground the space of a\ncubit.  Then he departed to the desert of the south, and he lived there in fasting and prayer;\nand he mortified his flesh exceedingly, and finished his strife there.  And God gave him the\npromise concerning the man who should invoke his name or celebrate his\ncommemoration; and he died in peace and the place of his grave in the south is not known\nto this day.  Salutation to Yared.\n\nAnd on this day also died the blessed woman Arsema. This holy woman became a nun in a\nhouse of virgins, and pretended to be mad, and during the night she afflicted herself, and\ntortured her flesh with fasting and prayer.  And when anyone looked at her, she pretended\nto be asleep; and the widows hated her and reviled her.  And God revealed her spiritual\nfight to Abba Daniel, and when he arrived in the mountain of the widows he told the\nabbess all her virtues, and she told the widows, one by one, and from that day they treated\nher with honor.  And, hating vain praise, she fled and went into the desert secretly, leaving\nbehind her with one of them a writing wherein she praised them for having treated her\nwith contumely, and there she died.\nAnd on this day also Saint Euphemia became a martyr in the reign of Diocletian.  The\nname of her mother was Theodoriasiana, and she was a God-fearing woman and a believer\non our Lord Jesus Christ.  And Satan urged Antiopatus to compel all the Christians to\nworship idols, and he had her, and many other Christians with her, brought to him, and he\nsaid unto her, “Sacrifice to the gods.”  And Saint Euphemia said unto him, “I will worship\nmy Lord Jesus Christ only, and I am strong of heart in the Holy Spirit that I may find the\nhope of my Father.”  Then was Antiopatus wroth, and he commanded his soldiers to cast\nher under the wheels of a wagon (?), so that it might break her body and each of her\nmembers; and the angel of the Lord came from heaven and delivered her.  And then he\ncommanded them to light a fire [and to feed it] until its flames rose up to a height of five\nand forty cubits, and to throw her into it.  And she stood up in the midst of the fire and\nprayed, and as she prayed she went forth from the fire uninjured; and then they cast her\ninto the prison house until the morning.  And on the following day they brought her before\nthe Council, and the governor said unto her, “Sacrifice to the gods.”  And the saint laughed\nand said unto him, “I will not sacrifice to these dumb stones.”  When Antiopatus heard her,\nhe commanded the soldiers to bring four stones wherein were set instruments for flaying\nthe saint.  And then he commanded them to cast her into a tank of water wherein were\nsavage creatures (crocodiles ?), and these creatures carried her and lifted her above the\nwater, and set her outside the tank.  And then he ordered them to place under the dust of\nthe ground sharp stones and swords, and to make her to run backwards and forwards over\nthem, so that she might fall down and die, but when she had run over them she remained\nuninjured.  And then he commanded them to beat her, and to cast her into a cauldron to\nboil her, but she suffered no injury whatsoever.  And then they gathered together wild\nbeasts and bears, and set them at her, but the lions kissed her feet, though one savage beast\nin evil nature bit her foot.  And a voice came from heaven, saying, “Ascend, O Euphemia,\nand come into the holy place,” and thus she finished her martyrdom.  And her father\nPhilophilus and her mother came, and swathed her body for burial and buried her in a new\ntomb.  Salutation to Euphemia who finished her course through a bite of a wild beast. \nSalutation to the companions of Euphemia, Sosthenes, and Yeketras.\nAnd on this day also became martyrs Saint Sophia, the mother of Saint Isidore, and his\nsister Euphemia.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Abba Bakimos, and  Abladen (Ablanius), and\nJulius.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and thou thyself shalt become a great and strong pillar in the city\nof the kingdom of the heavens.  And behold, the Archbishop of the city of Antioch shall\ncome unto thee, and with him shall come all the priests and deacons of the Church, each in\nhis grade; go thou with them and whatsoever he shall command thee that do, for it is God\nWho hath commanded thee this, and it is not meet for thee to transgress the commandment\nof God.”   And after this the angel of the Lord appeared unto the archbishop, Abba\nPhilotheus, and commanded him to appoint Saint John a priest.  And on the following day\nthe archbishop came, and with him were all the priests, and he took this father and made\nhim a priest against his will.  And when the Archbishop of the city of Constantinople died,\nthe Emperor Arcadius sent and brought Saint John, and appointed him Archbishop of the\ncity of Constantinople.  And he went to his archiepiscopal office like the Apostles, and he\ntaught the people frequently the Life-giving Doctrine, and admonished them often, and\nexpounded to them the Books of the Church [and] the Old and New Testaments.  And he\ncomposed many Homilies, and he rebuked many sinners, and was afraid neither of the\nemperor nor of his high officers of state.  And the Empress Eudoxia, the wife of Arcadius,\nwas a lover of money, and she took a garden belonging to a certain widow from her by\nforce, to add to the grounds of the palace.  And the widow came to Saint John and told him\nhow the Empress Eudoxia had taken her garden, and Saint John sent to the Empress\nEudoxia, and rebuked her, and entreated her with many entreaties to give back to the\nwidow her garden; but when she refused to obey his request, he excommunicated her, and\nforbade her to enter the church or to partake of the Holy Mysteries.  And fury entered her\nsoul and she gathered together the company of the bishops whom John had\nexcommunicated, and cut off from their sees, because of their evil deeds and sins, and they\nwrote letters, and made common cause against Saint John in order that he might be exiled,\nand the empress exiled him to the Island of ‘Akratao.  When he arrived there he found that\nthe men of that island were heretics, and that they walked in the way of evil deeds.  And\nSaint John rebuked them, and taught them, and turned them from the path of error, and\nbrought them into the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ by means of the signs and miracles,\nwhich he wrought before them.   When Honorius, Emperor of Rome, and Yonaknidos\n(Innocent) Konifanyos, Archbishop of the city of Rome, heard of the exile of Saint John,\nthey sorrowed exceedingly, and they sent letters to Arcadius, scolding him.  And they said\nunto him, “Take heed to this wicked act which thou hast committed.  If thou dost not obey\nus, and dost not bring back Saint John from his exile, there shall certainly not be peace\nbetween us and thee from this time forward.”  When Arcadius read their letters he was\nexceedingly sad, and he made his wife, the Empress Eudoxia, to stand aside.   And he\nbrought Saint John from exile; and when he arrived all the people of the city of\nConstantinople rejoiced with an exceedingly great joy.  And after a few days the Empress\nEudoxia returned, and exiled him a second time to the Island of  Akratys, and he died on\nthe Island.   And when Honorius, the just emperor, and Yonakendinos (Innocent), the\narchbishop, knew that [the empress] had exiled Saint John [a second time], they were\nexceedingly sorry, and the archbishop sent a letter to the Empress Eudoxia, and\nanathematized her, and banned her from receiving the Holy Mysteries until she brought\nback Saint John from exile.   Then straightway she sent [messengers] to the Island of \n‘Atrakya to bring back Saint John from the Island, and they found that he was dead; and\nthey took his body and brought it to the city of Constantinople.  And they sent messengers\nto Abba Yonakendyos (Innocent), Archbishop of the city of Rome, and informed him that\nSaint John had died on the Island, and how they had brought his body to the city of\nConstantinople.  And he sent a second time, and anathematized the Empress Eudoxia, and\nprohibited her from receiving the Holy Mysteries, and from entering a church for eight\nmonths; but they entreated him very urgently, and he sent and removed the ban. \nNevertheless God afflicted her with a very serious illness, and she gave much money to\nthe physicians, but she was not healed of her disease until she went to the body of Saint\nJohn, and bowed down before it.  And she wept and entreated him to forgive her the sin,\nwhich she had committed against him, and Saint Abba John had compassion upon her, and\nhealed her of her disease.  And God made manifest very many signs and wonders through\nthe body of this Saint Abba John.  And as concerning why Saint Abba John was called\n“Mouth of Gold,” it is said that he was sitting one day with the Emperor Arcadius, who\nhad his nobles with him, and the Emperor Arcadius said unto my father Abba John, “I\n\nwant to ask thee to explain to me a passage which hath been in my mind for many days.  It\nis this:  Why doth John the evangelist say in the Holy Gospel, that Joseph did not know\nour holy Lady the Virgin Mary, until she had brought forth her first-born Son; did he know\nher as men usually know women?”  And Saint John answered him, saying, “It is not thus,\nO Emperor, but when our Lord Jesus Christ was in the womb of our holy Lady the Virgin\nMary, she used to change her appearance day by day, and at one time her person used to\nshine with great light, and Joseph did not know her understanding until she brought forth\nour Lord and Redeemer Christ.  When she had brought forth our Lord and Redeemer Jesus\nChrist he knew the appearance of her person.”  And there was in the emperor’s chamber a\npicture of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, which was painted in gold, and\na voice came forth from it, saying, “Thou hast well said, O John, thou Tongue of Gold”;\nand when the emperor, and his nobles, and the officers of his army heard this, they\nmarveled exceedingly and praised God.  And thereupon the emperor gave the command,\nand one brought a skilled worker in metals, and he made a tongue of gold for the holy and\nhonored John, and he hung it by the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-\nbearer, so that it might be a sign for everyone to see.  And the emperor commanded that\nmen should call Saint John “Tongue of Gold,” and because of this Saint John is called\n“Tongue of Gold” to this very day.  Salutation to John who preferred exile to partaking the\nOffering with an empress who loved violence.\n Salutation to the companion of Jesus and His Passion, whose name was Isakos.\n And on this day also appeared in mid-heaven, the Cross of Light above Golgotha, in the\ncity of Jerusalem, when the holy father Abba Cyril was appointed Bishop of Jerusalem, in\nthe days of the kingdom of Constantine the Less, the son of Constantine the Great.  And it\nappeared at the sixth hour of the day, and it remained steadily in its position, and its light\noutshone the light of the sun, and it continued to be visible until the ninth hour; and\neveryone came from every country to see it.  And Abba Cyril sent a letter to the Emperor\nConstantine, saying, “Know, O emperor, that in the days of thy glorious father,\nConstantine the Just, a cross appeared, which was like unto the stars of heaven, and in thy\ndays also, O emperor, there hath appeared a cross of light above Cranium (i.e. Golgotha),\nand the light thereof outshineth the sun, and it extendeth as far as the holy tomb of our\nLord Jesus Christ, and as far as the Mount of Olives.”  And he said [also] in this letter,\n“Beware, O emperor, of the Faith of the wicked Arius, and trust not, and receive not, any\nof those who believe in his wicked Faith.”  And Saint Abba Cyril made a great festival on\nthe day whereon this glorious cross appeared, and he ordained that the festival should be\nkept on this day, and it is meet for us [to keep it].  And he wrote it in the Exposition of\nJerusalem, and similarly all Christian people everywhere have written it down, and they\nkeep the festival this day, even as we always keep the festival of the Honorable Cross.  For\nit is our salvation, and it is [our] armor against all our enemies, both those, which are\nsecret and those, which are visible, provided that we take refuge therein in True Faith. \nSalutation I cry with perpetual voice to the Cross, which appeared this day above\nGolgotha.\n And on this day also are commemorated the martyrs Minas, the deacon, and Stephen.\n And on this day also died Jared, the son of Mahalaleel.  After he had lived one hundred\nand sixty-two years, he begot Enoch; and his days were nine hundred and sixty and two\nyears.  He died on Friday at the third hour.\nAnd on this day also took place the translation of the body of the glorious father, and\nteacher of the world, and head of all the monks, our father Abba Tekle Haimanot, the equal\nof the angels, and the apostles, and the martyrs; and the cause of its translation was thus. \nWhen the period of time had expired which God announced to him, saying, “After six and\nfifty years they shall translate thy body from thy cave to the shrine which they shall build\nfor thee,” forthwith signs and wonders took place, and the blind [were made] to see, and\nthe lame walked.  These things happened in the days of Abba Hezekiah, the inheritor of his\nthrone, and the day was the twelfth of Genbot.  Salutation to Tekle Haimanot, for when a\n\nblind woman, who held in her hand a bread-cake of the festival of his commemoration,\ntouched her eyes therewith, she was able to see the light.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and after this he died in peace.  Salutation to Abba\nPachomius and to each of his sons.\nAnd on this day also became a martyr Symmachus, of the city of Farma, in the days of\nBulamis, governor of Mesr (Cairo).  This holy man was a weaver of linen apparel, and\ncostly, fine linen napkins, and he had [two] friends, Theodore and Kikos.  And when he\nheard that Bulamis, the governor, had arrived, and that he was punishing the Christians,\nthis holy man began to teach his companions, and to admonish them to abandon the glory\nof this fleeting world.  Then he embraced them and went out to the town of Bakruz, which\nwas near the town of Demera, and he came to the governor and found him torturing a\nwoman, whom they cast into a fiery furnace and she became a martyr; and after this the\nfiery furnace became like cool dew.  And this holy man was looking on at this, and\nafterward, he drew nigh unto the governor, and confessed our Lord and Redeemer Jesus\nChrist, and the governor tortured him severely.  Now at that time he was sixteen years of\nage.  Next, the governor hung him up, and he threw him on the wheel, and he crushed his\nfeet, and blood dripped from his body in great quantity; and some of the blood splashed on\nthe eyes of a certain blind maiden, and she was able to see forthwith.  Then the governor\nhung him upon a tree, and the saint prayed many prayers to our Lord Jesus Christ, and\nmade supplication to Him.  And the governor commanded them to cut off the head of the\nsaint, and the headsman drew his sword, and wanted to cut off his head with his sword, but\nhis strength failed him, and he was unable to cut off the saint’s head.  And the same thing\nhappened when a second headsman tried, and a third headsman also, even to the tenth\nheadsman, for the strength of all the ten failed them, and they fell down on the ground. \nAnd after this they tied a rope round the neck of Saint Abba Symmachus, the martyr, and\nthey dragged him up to the top of a high mountain, and he delivered up his soul into the\nhand of God, and he received the incorruptible crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the\n\nheavens.  And there was among the four soldiers one who was deaf and dumb, and as soon\nas he saw the body of the saint, he heard with his ears and his tongue spoke.  And\nbelieving men came from the city of Edku, and they took away the body of Saint Abba\nSymmachus, and many signs and wonders took place through it, and great healings.  And\nthe governor Bilamis was afraid and fled.  And men gathered together from the double\ntown Demertayn, and consoled the kinsfolk of Saint Abba Symmachus the martyr.  And\nwhen the pagans of the city saw the signs and wonders which were revealed through him,\nthey believed and were baptized with Christian baptism, and became martyrs; and they\nwere in number sixteen hundred and fifty men and woman and children.  And the kinsfolk\nof the saint came and carried away his body to the city Barmun with great honor, and the\ngovernor of the city of Barmun swathed it for burial in costly cloths at his own expense;\nand they built a beautiful church for the saint and laid the body of Abba Symmachus in it. \nSalutation to Symmachus, and salutation to the great company of man and women who\nwere martyred with him.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

He it was who was called\n“Nathaniel.”  This saint was from Cana of Galilee, and he was learned in the Law of the\nTorah, and in the Books of the Prophets, and he had in him zeal and was therefore called\nZealot, and he was just and pure in the Faith, and he accepted the person of no man.  And\nit was because of this that when Philip said unto him, “Behold, we have found our Lord\nChrist, concerning Whom Moses the prophet wrote, Jesus, the son of Joseph, from\nNazareth,” he would not agree with him, but said unto him, “Can any good thing come out\nof Nazareth?”  And Philip said unto him, “Come and see,” and when he came, our Lord\nsaid unto him, “This is an Israelite in whose heart there is no deceit.”  But Simon did not\nincline to praise, and he demanded from Him a reason for His praise, and he said unto our\nLord, “Where didst Thou know me?”  And our Lord answered and said unto him, “Before\nPhilip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree I saw thee.”  And Simon knew that in\ntruth our Lord knew the things, which were hidden, and he said unto Him, “My Lord and\nmy God.”  And Simon did not set himself in opposition to Christ, like the chiefs of the\nJews, who although they saw and heard what was great and stupendous, did not obey and\nsubmit to the righteous man.  Now it is said concerning this saint, that when he was a\nyoung man he had a quarrel with another young man, a Gentile, in the desert, and that\nSimon smote him a blow, and killed him straightway, and that he buried him under a fig\ntree which he had in his house, and no one knew about it except our Savior.  And it is also\nsaid concerning him that at the time of the slaughter of the babes [by Herod], his mother\nhid him in the market (or, bazaar), and hung him up in a tree which was in her house, and\nthat she used to take him down and give him suck, and then hang him up again; and she\ncontinued to do this until the persecution of Herod died down.  And she told him nothing\nwhatsoever about this until he was fully grown up, and he never told any man what had\nhappened unto him; and when [our Redeemer] revealed unto him the salvation which\ncame to him by a miracle, Simon knew that He was the Son of God in truth, and that He\nknew hidden things and was informed about everything.   And straightway he bowed\nbefore our Redeemer, and was obedient unto Him, and followed him from that day, and\nbecame one of the Twelve Apostles.  And having received the gift of the Holy Spirit, the\nParaclete, he talked the languages of all countries, and he knew divine mysteries.  And he\ncame to the town of Kuerja, and to the country of El-Bejah, where he entered into the\ndarkness of the infidels, and lighted a portion thereof.  And he converted many of the wise\nmen and fools, and lighted them with the light of Christian baptism, and he made those\nwho had been aforetime like ravening wolves to become like sheep.  And he went to the\ncity of the infidels, and to many [other] cities, and he went into the Island of Barantya, and\npreached therein.   And the infidels seized him in every place, and they entreated him\nevilly, and tortured him severely with divers kinds of tortures.   And God added to his\npower and strength when being tortured, and God performed great signs and wonders, and\n[as examples] of them he raised the dead, and [healed] those whose bones were decayed\nand dried up; and they asked him to baptize them with Christian baptism, and he baptized\nthem.  And he lived for many years after this, and he healed a leper at the time when he\nbaptized him with Christian baptism.  And after this the infidels seized him, and hung him\nup on a tree, and he received the perfect and glorious crown of martyrdom in the kingdom\nof the heavens.  Salutation to Nathaniel.\n \nAnd on this day also four hundred (sic) people became martyrs in the city of Denderah, in\nUpper Egypt.  Towards the end of his reign Diocletian tortured them with divers severe\ntortures, and then they became martyrs through having their heads cut off.\n\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Minas, the deacon, and anchorite, and Abba Hor,\nand Baklawaya.

now they were poor, for the father of this saint was a slave, but they were\nrighteous.  And the father of this saint died and left him and one daughter, and their mother\nbrought them up in the Law of Moses.  And his father left him a donkey, which was a very\npoor animal, and his mother advised Saint Epiphanius to sell this donkey, and with the\nprice thereof to obtain some rest and relief in his wretched life.   And as the saint was\njourneying along with the donkey, he met a certain man who was a Christian, and a just\nman, and whose name was Philotheus; and he stopped and talked with Epiphanius and\nwanted to buy that donkey from him.  And at that moment the donkey kicked Epiphanius\nin his stomach, and he fell down on the ground, and was very near death, but Saint\nPhilotheus made the sign of the Cross over the stomach of Saint Epiphanius, saying, “In\nthe Name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost,” and Saint Epiphanius was cured\nof his pain forthwith, and he rose up as if he hand never suffered any pain whatsoever. \nAnd then Saint Philotheus cried out over that donkey, saying, “In the Name of our Lord\nJesus Christ Who was crucified thou shalt die”; and the donkey fell down and died\nforthwith.   And when Saint Epiphanius saw these two miracles, he said unto Saint\nPhilotheus, “Who was this Jesus Who was crucified, and in Whose Name thou didst\nperform this miracle?”  And Philotheus answered and said unto him, “This Jesus was the\nSon of God, Whom the Jews crucified in Jerusalem”; and this word remained in the heart\nof Saint Epiphanius.   And in those days there was a certain rich Jew who took Saint\nEpiphanius into his house, and brought him up and taught him the Law of Moses.  And\nwhen death drew nigh to that Jew, he had no heirs, and he made Saint Epiphanius heir of\nall his possessions, and he learned all the Jewish doctrine and the Law of Moses.  And one\nday he met a certain righteous and learned monk, whose name was Lucianus, and he was a\nteacher, and the grace of God was upon him, and he walked with him on the road.  And as\nthey were journeying together on the road, a certain poor man met them and he asked the\nmonk to give him alms, and as the monk had no money with him to give him, he took off\nthe hair cloak, which he was wearing and gave it to him.  And when the poor man took it\nSaint Epiphanius saw that white apparel came down from heaven upon the monk; and he\nmarveled at this and he bowed down at the feet of the monk, and he asked him, saying,\n“Who art thou?  What is thy Faith?”  And the monk made known to him that he was a\nChristian; and Saint Epiphanius asked him to make him a Christian.  And the monk took\nEpiphanius and brought him to the bishop, who baptized him with Christian baptism, and\ntaught him the Law of the Christian Faith.  And Saint Epiphanius said unto him, “I wish to\nbecome a monk,” and the bishop said unto him, “Thou hast many goods and possessions;\nit is not necessary for thee to become a monk.”  And Saint Epiphanius went and brought\nhis sister, and the bishop baptized her with Christian baptism.   And he gave of his\npossessions to the poor and the needy, and to the widows and the orphans, and to the\nchurches, and he purchased very many books.  Then he became a monk, and his sister\nbecame a nun, in the monastery of that monk whose name was Julius, and who was the\ncause of his being baptized; now at that time he was in his days sixteen years old.  And he\nfound in that monastery Saint Hilarion the Great, who although young in days was an elder\nin the spiritual fight, and he received Saint Epiphanius, and taught him the path of the\nascetic life, and the doctrine of Christian Law.  And the grace of God dwelt upon him, and\nHilarion made him strong in all the Law of the Church, and in the path of the ascetic life in\n\na few days, and then Saint Epiphanius became perfect in the spiritual fight.   And he\nperformed great miracles, and raised the dead, and cast out demons from men, and he\nmade fountains of water to appear in dry places where there was no water, and on many\noccasions he made rain to fall; and the report of him and of his virtues, and of his\nknowledge, was noised abroad.  And many men from among the Jews came to him, to\ndispute with him, and he showed them their error, and they believed through him, and he\nbaptized them with Christian baptism; and he likewise converted very many of the\nphilosophers and the Greeks, and brought them into the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ. \nAnd Saint Hilarion, his teacher, prophesied concerning him and said that he would be\nmade bishop of the city of Cyprus, and he commanded him to go to the city of Cyprus, and\nto dwell there in a certain place wherein he ordered him to abide.  And he said unto him,\n“They will seek thee to make thee bishop, for it is the Will of God.”  And Saint Epiphanius\ndeparted to Cyprus, and he dwelt in the place wherein his teacher Hilarion had ordered\nhim to dwell.  Now at the time when the Bishop of Cyprus died, Saint Epiphanius came\ninto the city to buy food, and he had two monks with him.  And there was in that city an\naged bishop, a righteous man, and our Lord Jesus Christ spoke unto him, saying, “Go to\nthe market and thou shalt meet a monk with two bunches of grapes in his hand which he is\ngoing to buy, and his name is ‘Epiphanius’; make him Bishop of Cyprus, for he is suitable\nfor this office.”  And the aged bishop rose and went to the market, and he found Saint\nEpiphanius, and there were two bunches of grapes in his hand, and there were two monks\nwith him, and he asked him his name, and he answered and said unto him, “My name is\nEpiphanius.”  And the aged bishop said unto him, “Cast these grapes from thy hands.” \nAnd Saint Epiphanius knew that the prophecy of Abba Hilarion his teacher was fulfilled,\nand he cast the grapes down, and he went with him to the church.  And the bishop made\nhim a deacon, and three days later he made him a priest, and on the seventh day he made\nhim a bishop.   After this that aged bishop wished to gladden the heart of Bishop\nEpiphanius, and he told the people and made to understand concerning the vision, which\nhe had seen concerning him, and they rejoiced in him with great joy.   And this Saint\nEpiphanius followed a right course of action in his diocese, which was well pleasing to\nGod, and he wrote many Discourses (or, Homilies) and many books wherein will be found\nprofitable doctrine.  When he heard of a man in whom there was no mercy, he used to\nrebuke him and teach him frequently until he changed his nature and became merciful. \nAnd when this Saint Epiphanius heard that Abba John, Bishop of the city of Jerusalem,\nwas a man without pity, he made an excuse, and borrowed from him the gold and silver\nvessels which he used at his table and out of which he ate, and Abba John gave them to\nhim, and Saint Epiphanius sold them, and gave [the price of] them to the poor and needy. \nAnd when Abba John asked him for them and he would not give back any of them, he\nseized Saint Epiphanius by the hem of his garment, in the Church of the Sepulcher of our\nLord Jesus Christ.  And Saint Epiphanius prayed to God, and He made blind the eyes of\nAbba John forthwith.  And his eyes being blind, Abba John begged and prayed him with\ntears to teach him, and to open his eyes, and Saint Epiphanius prayed and entreated God\non his behalf, and God opened one of them.  And then Epiphanius told Abba John how he\nhad sold the vessels of his table, and how he had given [the price of] them to the poor. \nAnd the Empress Eudoxia having sent a message to Saint Epiphanius to come to her, and\nto help her to break and to drive out Saint John, the Mouth of God (i.e. Chrysostom), he\nwent to the city of Constantinople wishing to make peace between them; but the empress\nwould not listen to him, and she would not submit to Saint Epiphanius in respect of Saint\nJohn, the Mouth of Gold.  And the empress answered and said unto Saint Epiphanius, “If I\ncannot cast down John, the Mouth of Gold, from his office, I will open the houses of idols\nand shut the churches”; and Saint Epiphanius went forth from her presence sad and\nsorrowful, and wondering what he should do.  And the servants of the empress made it\nknown in the city of Constantinople, saying, “Behold, Epiphanius hath deposed John, the\n\nMouth of Gold.”  When Saint John heard this report he sent a letter unto Saint Epiphanius,\nsaying, “Why hast thou done this unjust thing against me; know thou that thou shalt never\nreach the throne of thy diocese?”  And Saint Epiphanius sent a reply to his letter, saying, “I\nhave written nothing concerning thee, and I am not in agreement with the empress against\nthee, and as for thyself thou shalt [not] return from exile.”  After this Saint Epiphanius\nwanted to return to the throne of his diocese, and he went forth from the city of\nConstantinople to depart to the city of Cyprus, and God willed to make him to die on the\nship before he reached the throne of his diocese, even as God had revealed to John, the\nMouth of Gold; and John, the Mouth of Gold, also died on his journey, even as He had\nmade Epiphanius to see.  And the saint knew the time of his death, and he rose up and\nprayed, and he gave his disciples commands and informed them that they should become\nbishops, and after that he embraced them, and he lay down and died in peace.  Salutation\nto Epiphanius.  Salutation to Abba Lucianus, Bishop of Degno.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

but know ye that they will cast you\nout of their synagogues, and the time will come and arrive when all who kill you will\nimagine that they are bringing sacrifices unto God.”  And He also saith, “The words which\nI say unto you I say by My truth; It is better for you that I go to the Father, for if I do not\ngo to the Father the Paraclete cannot come unto you; and if I go I will send Him to you. \nAnd when He hath come, He will rebuke the world concerning sin, and righteousness, and\npunishment.   Concerning sin, because they have not believed on Me, and concerning\nrighteousness, because I go to the Father, and ye shall not see Me again, and concerning\npunishment, because the work of this world shall be judged.  And there are many [other]\nwords which I would say unto you, but ye are not able to bear them now.  And when that\nSpirit of righteousness hath come, He will guide you into all righteousness, He will not\nspeak to you from Himself, but He will declare unto you what He hath heard.  And He\nWho shall come to you shall speak unto you, and tell you.  Me He will glorify and praise,\nfor He springeth from Me, and He will speak unto you, and will tell you.”  And after His\nResurrection in ascending to His Father He fulfilled all the Law of Incarnation.  And He\nsaid unto His disciples, “Go unto all nations and, in baptizing them, say, ‘In the Name of\nthe Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.’”  Salutation to Thy descent, O Paraclete. \nSalutation to Thy descent, O Paraclete, the Spirit of grace and righteousness.  Salutation to\nThee, O Paraclete, Who didst make the Apostles to drink of Thy fire in a moment.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Ga’argi, the companion of Abba Abraham. \nThis holy man was a Christian, and his parents were holy and righteous folk, and when he\ngrew up he became a shepherd and tended their flocks.  And he was always thinking in his\nmind that he would adopt the garb of the monk, and when his days were twelve years, the\ngrace of God moved him, and he forsook his sheep and went and walked about in the\ndesert of Scete.  And he saw a pillar of light at a distance, and he went towards it until he\narrived at a river, and then the pillar of light hid itself.  And when he had crossed that river,\nSatan appeared unto him in the form of an old man, who said unto him, “Know, O my son,\nthat I saw thy father rending his garments, and weeping for thee, and sorrowing\nexceedingly.  It is meet that thou shouldst return to thy father, and comfort his heart, for he\nthinketh that a wild beast of the desert hath torn thee in pieces”; and after this he returned\nto the desert.   Now Saint Abba Ga’agi was frightened for a time.   And then [he\nremembered], that the Holy Gospel saith, “He who loveth his father or his mother more\nthan Me is not meet to be My disciple” (Matthew x, 37); and having said these words that\nSatan became like smoke, and fled from him; and the saint knew that he was Satan.  And\nstraightway the pillar of light appeared unto him, and the angel of God walked with him in\nthe form of a monk, and the saint followed the angel until he brought him to the monastery\nof the holy father Arion.   And Abba Ga’argi dwelt in that monastery with a certain\nrighteous monk ten years; he tasted no meat, he drank no wine, and he ate no fruit, and\nduring the ten years he never lay down to sleep, but slept sitting.  And his asceticism and\nhis spiritual fight having become more strenuous, the angel of God appeared unto him and\nsaid, “God telleth thee to moderate the strictness of thine asceticism, and the intensity of\nthy spiritual fight, so that thy body may not become exhausted”; and then he drew up for\nhim a rule of life which ordered him to sit down, and to fast every day until the evening. \nAnd he ate a little bread, and he slept from the time he went to sleep until midnight, for the\nrepose of his body, and the rest of the night he kept vigil and prayed until the day dawned. \nAnd having continued to observe this course of life for many days, he wished to live by\nhimself in the Inner Desert; and he continued to go round about in the desert for two\nyears.   And a vision appeared unto him which directed him to return to his place, and\nstraightway the Divine Power bought him to the monastery of Saints Maximus and\nDimatheus which was near his monastery.   And when he went back to his monastery,\nAbraham came out from the world, and having arrived at that monastery he met Abba\n\nGa’argi.   And they made friends together, and came to the monastery of Saint Abba\nMacarius, and they dwelt with Saint John, Abbot of the desert of Scete; and he gave them\na cell near him, and they dwelt therein, and that place is well known to this day.  And that\ncell was called “Bagbig,” and our Lord Jesus Christ dwelt with them, now He rent the roof\nof their abode, and they worshipped Him, and He gave them peace and comforted them,\nand went up from them into heaven.   And that opening through which our Lord came\ndown, and through which they saw the light, is open unto this day.  And these saints wrote\nmany books, and Homilies, and Exhortations, and Admonitions for monks, and they\nprepared the way for him that would be obedient, and live in subjection to his fathers.  And\nAbba Abraham died on the second day of the month of Ter, and after him Saint Abba\nGa’argi died on the eighteenth day of the month of Genbot.  And all the days of his life\nwere two and seventy years; of these fourteen he passed in the world and eight and fifty he\ndevoted to the ascetic life.  Salutation to Abba Ga’argi, who forsook his father’s flocks and\nfollowed a pillar of light into the desert.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated Sinoda, the martyr.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

is not one set of garments more profitable to me?”  And he was wont to weep\nvery often, and if men asked him, and said unto him, “Why dost thou weep?” he would say\nunto them, “Because my parents died, and left me an orphan.”  And for many years he\ncontinued to mix the ashes from the censers with the bread, which he ate at his table.  One\nday he became sick of a grievous sickness, and one of the brethren brought him a little\nfood, which had been prepared and cooked by fire, and he would not eat it.  And when that\nbrother had asked him many questions he said unto him, “This food is good and will cure\nthy sickness.”  And Isaac answered, and said unto him, “Believe my, O my brother, I wish\nto remain sick with this sickness, for three years . . . “ And when he became old in days,\nand his excellences, and his righteous deeds, were many, the elders gathered together, and\ntook counsel that they might make him a priest.  And he fled from them, and went into the\nfield where the crops were, and hid himself therein; and the elders went about seeking for\nhim but could not find him.  And when they had passed through the field, they sat down on\nthe border of it to rest.  Now they had with them a donkey, and that donkey went into the\nfield, and stood still by the place where this father was, and when the elders came into the\nfield to catch the donkey they found this father; and they seized him and wanted to bind\nhim so that he might not flee from them.  And he said unto them, “Henceforward I shall\nknow that this is the Will of God.”  And he went with them, and was made priest, and he\nadded to the commands which were laid on the holy fathers, and he taught the young men\ngood works, and he used to say to them, “Above everything possess ye submission and\nobedience, for these are the greatest of the virtues.”  And when the time of his death drew\nnigh, the young men asked him to dwell in the desert that he might teach them what to do\nafter he [had left them], and he answered and said unto them, “As long as ye see me\nworking do ye work, if ye wish to strengthen the habit of dwelling in the desert.  When our\nfathers died we sorrowed, but when we do even as they did, ye strengthen [our habit of]\ndwelling in the desert after them.”  And having said these words he died in peace, and\nreceived the crown of praise from our Lord Jesus Christ.  Salutation to Isaac the priest.\nAnd on this day also the holy, and mighty, and great, and honorable fighter, the blessed\nIsidore, became a martyr.  This saint was a man of the city of Antioch.  His father was an\nhonorable man of the kingdom, and the captain of many soldiers, and his name was\nBandala’on; and the name of his mother was Sofia, and she and her husband belonged to\nChristian families.  And when she brought forth her son she called his name “Isidore.” \nAnd after many days, when his father Bandala’on saw the greatness of the sin and of the\ntransgressions which the Emperor Diocletian, the infidel, committed, he withdrew his son\nIsidore from him, and they left the estate which was formerly theirs, for they belonged to\nthe nobles of the kingdom.  And they took up their abode in the monasteries, where they\nremained in hiding, and they lived with a man who was called Samuel . . . for the sake of\nthe Name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And after this, certain heretics and evil persons went\n\nand accused them before the emperor of hiding from him, and refusing to worship idols;\nand straightway the emperor sent five hundred soldiers and had them brought before him. \nAnd they confessed our Lord Jesus Christ, and they said unto him boldly, “When thou\ndidst forsake our Lord Jesus Christ, we forsook thee; thou hast committed great\nabominations before God.”  Then the emperor was wroth, and he commanded his soldiers\nto cut off the head of Bandala’on, and they cut off his head and he received the crown of\nmartyrdom; and Saint Isidore he bound in prison, in order that he might be rebuked.  Now\nat that time the days of Isidore were twelve years.  And after a few days they brought him\nto the emperor having tied a rope, with a heavy iron weight attached to it, round his neck,\nand he was strong in the Faith; and the emperor asked him, saying, “Is not thy heart\nsoftened, and doth it not advise [thee] to turn from thy Faith?”  And having refused to turn\nfrom the True Faith, the emperor forthwith commanded the soldiers to hoist him on the\nrack, and to rack his body until his blood ran like water [and they did so].  Then his mother\nSofia took a handful of his blood and dashed it in the face of the emperor, and said unto\nhim, “Cursed art thou above all men.”  And his sister Euphemia also took up stones, and\ncast them at the emperor and his officers.  And the emperor was wroth, and commanded\nhis soldiers to cut the women in halves, through their loins, and they did so, and the\nwomen finished their martyrdom.  And the saint was hanging on the rack, and watching\nwhat was happening to his mother and his sister.  And then the soldiers poured red-hot\ncoals upon his body, and after this they cut open his body, and dragged out his bowels, and\nthrew them out into the desert; but neither the fowl of the air nor the wild beasts would\napproach them.  And our Redeemer healed him, and raised him up as he was before, and\nthen the saint went before the emperor.  And the emperor commanded them to put him on\nthe iron bed, and to light a fire under him, [and they did so,] and they also put him on the\niron bed, and crushed him until his bowels came out; and again our Redeemer raised him\nup.  And then [the emperor] killed him together with eight hundred souls, and again our\nRedeemer raised him up.  And when the emperor saw him, he commanded the soldiers to\nbind him, and to cast him into a cauldron of brass, and to pour pitch and grease over him,\nand to light a fire under him, and the soldiers did so.  And after a few days he commanded\nthem to cut off his head, and they cut off his head, and forthwith our Lord raised him up\nfrom the dead; and behold, this was the third time that our Lord raised him up after he had\nbeen killed.  And after this they tied a stone to his neck, and cast him into the sea, and at\nthat very moment Saint Michael the archangel brought him out of the sea, and carried him\nto the place where the emperor was.  And the emperor commanded them to hang him upon\na tree, in the middle of the city, and they did so, and he died; again our Lord raised him\nup.  This was the fourth time, which he was raised from the dead.  And then, the fifth time,\nthey cast him to the lions, and God delivered him as He did Daniel the prophet.  And then\nthe emperor commanded the soldiers to cut him in pieces, and to pound them up, and to\ncast him into the sea in a basket; and the soldiers did so.  And forthwith our Lord came\ndown from heaven, (now Michael and Gabriel were following Him,) and He stood upon\nthe seashore, and brought Isidore up out of the sea; and He raised him up and healed him,\nand there was no injury on him.  And the emperor being ashamed, and unable to effect his\nwill, took counsel with his friends, and then decided to send him to the country of Salonika\nthat they might have him tortured there.  Then the emperor sent him away, bound hand and\nfoot, and there was a heavy wooden collar about his neck, but the governor of Salonika\nshowed mercy on him, because he had known him in days past.  When the emperor heard\nthis he was wroth, and he commanded the soldiers to bring the governor and Saint Isidore\nto him, and the governor delivered Isidore to him and the emperor placed him in the prison\nhouse, being hungry and thirsty.  Now whilst the saint was in the prison house he worked\ngreat miracles, and healed the sick.  And when the nineteenth day of Genbot had come, the\nemperor commanded the soldiers to take him outside the city, and to hang him upon a\nwooden cross, at the sixth hour of the day.  And the air was filled with angels, and our\nRedeemer was with them, and promised him many things; and Isidore, the saint of God\nforthwith delivered up his soul, and received the crown of life.  And the number of the\nyears from the beginning to the end of his strife is as follows; he was in prison for five\nyears before they tortured him, and he was in prison for one year in the city of Antioch,\nand for twelve years he suffered tortures.  Salutation to Isidore, and to Euphemia his sister,\nand to Sofia his mother.\n\nAnd on this day also eighty-five thousand and seven people became martyrs with Isidore. \nSalutation to these martyrs of the company of Isidore.\nAnd on this day also died Abba Joseph, the light of the world.  This holy man learned all\nthe philosophy of this world in his father’s house, so that those who saw him marveled at\nhim, and all the Books of the Church; and when he was grown up his father took him to\nthe bishop, who made him a deacon.  And God, Who willed the salvation of his soul, sent\nMichael, the angel of light, to him, and he said unto Joseph, “Dost thou love this fleeting\nworld?  Is not it and everything which is therein dross?”  Thereupon Joseph began to fast\nand to pray, and he asked God to guide him into the path, which he should follow.  Now\nthere was a certain monk on the borders of Walka, whose name was Abba Zacharias, and\nwho was of the kinsfolk of Abba Joseph, and he took Joseph secretly, and arrayed him in\nthe garb of the monk, and carried him away to the country of Tegre, where he learned to\nwork with his hands, and he wrote and weaved and performed all the work of the monastic\nlife.  Then they came into the desert of Barka, and each dwelt alone and labored in the\nascetic life; and they fed upon the fruits of the desert, and the roots of trees.  And they\nlived there, and the elephants, and serpents, and lions, had knowledge of them, and they\nworked many miracles by the might of their righteousness.  Abba Nathaniel carried a red-\nhot pot on his hand, and went round holding it in the presence of his brethren.  And Abba\nJoseph having smashed the pot in which he used to cook, join the pieces together without\nspilling his mess of pottage.  And when [the monks] wanted to baptize Gebre Kher, who\nwas about to die, he said unto them, “I will baptize myself with my own hand, for our\nLord Jesus Christ hath this day made me a bishop.”  Then each of the saints showed forth\nthe beauty of his deeds, and they carried Joseph to the bishop, and he was made a priest. \nWhen Abba Zacharias died, Abba Joseph departed into another desert, and he fasted for\nforty days and forty nights, standing up and not speaking; and when he fell down through\nexhaustion, Michael the angel came and raised him up.  And he also stood upon the edge\nof a great precipice with his arms extended like the arms of a cross, for forty days and\nforty nights, without taking a rest; and Satan came and cast him down into the abyss; and\nSaint Michael received him on his wings, and restored him to the place where he had\nstood.  And he also went into a stone cave, and remained there for forty days and forty\nnights without food and drink; and the demons came and frightened him, each with his\nown hellish devices, but the angels made him strong.  And he used to make eleven\nthousand prostrations at a time, until his brains ran down through his nose.  And from that\nplace he wandered about through all the mountains of Tegray, and he journeyed through\nthe land of the South, and he came to the tomb of Yared, and he saw gates of light before\nthe door of his cell, which was open, As he was returning thieves found him, and they\nstoned him with stones, and beat him with sticks, and they speared him with spears, and\nleft him lying prostrate.  And our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, came and healed him.  One\nday he found the body of a dead woman, and when he had made over it the sign of the\nCross, she rose up like a woman waking out of a sleep.  And he went on a pilgrimage to\nJerusalem thrice, and received the blessing of the holy places.  And he visited the tombs of\nPeter and Paul and the tombs of all the Apostles, and he traveled as far as Bartos and\nIndia.  When he came to a river, which was full of water, he used to make the sign of the\nCross over it, and then walk over the water on his feet; and the lions and the leopards\nfollowed him tamely.  When he lacked food he would say a blessing over some stones, and\nthey were turned into bread.  And he went to Debre Libanos, to the monastery of our father\nTakla Haymanot, and received the garb of the monk from Abba Tewolde Medhin.  And\nAbba Tewolde wished to try him, and he gave him six crushed and broken twigs to plant;\nand having planted them they grew up into trees, which exist to this day.  And many men\nand monks came to him, and lived under his authority, and they dwelt in one habitation\nnear a church, which had been built in the name of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the\nGod-bearer, and in the Name of God the Father.  And one day in a vision our holy Lady\nthe Virgin Mary gave him incense, and he offered up incense with the Four and Twenty\nPriests of heaven before the throne of the God of Hosts; and the Apostles used to come to\nhim, and bless him.  One day a leopard snatched away a child from his mother, and when\nshe had adjured the animal in the name of Joseph, the leopard brought the child back three\ndays later.  And he made it the rule for all his sons that they should possess neither money\n\nnor cattle, that they should not eat flesh or drink wine, old or new, that they should learn\nhumility and meekness, that they should not utter words of emptiness, and that they should\nnot laugh or joke in church; these and similar rules he laid down for them in their Canon. \nAnd having finished his life of labor and fighting, he died in peace, and was buried in the\nChurch of Heaven) which is called Debre Tabor; and through his body countless signs and\nwonders took place.  Salutation to Joseph.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated our great Abuna Egzi’e. \nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and moreover, he hath plundered the\nChurch, and destroyed the children of Thy people and Thine inheritance.  I believe on Thy\nOnly Son, and on the Holy and Living Spirit, and I have laid hold upon the horns of Thine\naltar and taken refuge in the sign of Thy Cross, and I am strong in the Faith.  And behold, I\nwill go out, and slay Thine enemies by the might of the Cross of Thine Only One and Thy\nMessiah, for I am jealous for Thee, and for my brethren, and for the believers my fathers. \nO God, let me not be put to shame and disappointed in my hope, so that they who do not\nknow Thy Name may not say, ‘Where is their God?’   If Thou wilt not hearken to my\nprayer, and wilt reject my petition because of the multitude of my sins and transgressions,\nslay me in this place.  O let not Thine inheritance fall into the hands of Thine enemies, the\ndeniers of Christ, who know not Thy Name; for we are Thy people and the sheep of Thy\npasture, and Thee we praise for ever and ever.  Amen.”  Then Caleb the king went out\nfrom his royal city, and he departed and destroyed, and killed all the Jews who had laid\nwaste the city of Nagran, and he performed countless miracles.  And he returned to his\nroyal city with great honor and joy not to be estimated, giving thanks to God at the same\ntime.  Then he thought in his heart and said, “With what shall I pay back to God for all that\nHe hath done for me?  But I have nothing whatsoever wherewith to reward Him, unless I\noffer my soul and body as a gift to my Lord Jesus Christ.”  Then he forsook the world, and\nabandoned his kingdom, and went out by night, and departed on foot, and came to the\nmonastery, which was on the top of the mountain of Abba Pantaleon, wherein good monks\nlived.  And he entered the monastery and lived in a cell, the doors whereof he shut so that\nhe might see no man, and he swore that he would never go outside the cell, and that he\nwould never see the world again.  And he took nothing in with him except a mat to lie\nupon, an earthenware pot, and the apparel of the monk, which he wore; and his food\nconsisted of nothing but bread and salt, and his drink was water.  His royal crown and his\nroyal apparel, which were of great price, he sent to Jerusalem.  And he wrote a letter to\nAbba John, Archbishop of Jerusalem, asking him to hang up the crown above the doors of\nthe Tomb of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And after [this] he went into that rock and never spoke\nto anyone; and he pleased God and died in peace.  Salutation to Caleb.\n\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Ammonius, of Dabra Tona.  When this\nsaint was a young man, he saw a vision in which it seemed that Saint Abba Anthony called\nhim to the monastic life.  When he awoke from his sleep he rose up straightway, and went\nto Saint Abba Isidore, who arrayed him in the garb of the monk, and Ammonius dwelt with\nhim.  And after this he returned to Dabra Tona, and he built himself a cell and he fought a\nstrenuous spiritual fight by day and by night.  And Satan the accursed became jealous of\nhim, and he came to him in the form of a woman, who was a nun.   And when Satan\nknocked at the door of his cell, he opened unto him, and he did not hide himself from him\nbecause the knocker was Satan, the Enemy.  And the saint asked him to pray with him, and\nSatan refused and revealed his iniquity, and he changed his form and became like a flame\nof fire, and then he said unto him, “I will bring upon thee still more strenuous warfare.” \nAnd Satan, the Enemy, departed.  And he entered into the heart of a certain young woman\nwith a beautiful face, and he moved her to attempt to make the saint to fall into sin.  And\nshe dressed herself in fine linen and came unto him at the time of evening, and she began\nto knock at the door of his cell and to say, “I am a woman on a pilgrimage, and I have\nstrayed from my road, and arrived [here], and the evening hath overtaken me; leave me not\noutside so that the wild beasts may not devour me, and I be punished for my sins.”  And\nwhen he opened the door to her, he knew that she was a trap of Satan, the accursed, and\nthat it was he who had sent her.  And he began to admonish her from the Divine Books,\nand he caused the fear of Hell to rise up in her, and dread of the punishment, which is\nprepared for sinners.  And he told her of the joy and gladness, which are prepared for the\nrighteous; and at that moment God opened her heart to understand what he said unto her. \nAnd she stripped off her fine apparel and cast herself down at his feet, and she wept and\nbegged him to receive, and to save her soul; and he shaved off the hair of her head, and\ndressed her in sackcloth of hair.   And she practiced many ascetic excellences, which\nexcelled in strictness the excellent works of the great saints.   Thus she prayed twelve\nhundred prayers in a night and a day, and she fasted two days or three days, or seven days,\nat a time, and the devil was put to shame by work of this kind.  And she became like a\nmonk in appearance, and used to go into all the monasteries [at will].   And a certain\nwretched man told [the brethren] that Abba Ammonius, after great ascetic labors, lusted\nfor and desired a woman, and that she was living with him in his cell, and that he had put\nthe monks to shame, and had disgraced the garb of the monk.  And when Abba ‘Ebelo,\nwho was like the angels heard this, he rose up straightway, and taking with him Abba\nJoseph and Abba Bohe, they came to Saint Ammonius in Dabra Tona.  And when they\nknocked at the door of his cell that woman went out to them, and they talked together, and\nsaid, “In truth, is what that monk told us true?”  Now Saint Abba Ammonius had called\nthat woman “Sadji,” that is to say, “the meek.”   And having entered into the cell and\nprayed, Abba ‘Ebelo, and Abba Joseph, and Abba Bohe sat down and talked until the\nevening concerning the greatness of God.  And Abba Ammonius said unto them, “Rise up,\nand let us go and see Sadji making a little bread for us.”  And when they had gone in they\nfound her standing in the red-hot oven, with her hand stretched out towards heaven, and\npraying; and when they saw her they marveled exceedingly at this great miracle, and they\nglorified God.  And after this she brought them bread, and they ate.  And that night the\nangel of God made known to Abba ‘Ebelo concerning the spiritual fight of Sadji, and to\nSaint Abba Ammonius, and that God Himself had brought them that day to witness the\ndeath of Sadji.  And when the third hour of the night arrived, she was seized with violent\nfever, and she made one prostration to God and at that moment she delivered up her soul;\nand they swathed her carefully and buried her.  And Abba Ammonius began to describe to\nthem her excellences, and he said unto them that Sadji had dwelt with him for eighteen\nyears, that she had never once raised her face, and that she had not seen his face nor he\nhers; and their food was bread and salt.  And a few days after Saint Abba Ammonius also\ndied.  Salutation to the blessed Ammonius of Tona.  Salutation, salutation to Sadji, the\ndisciple of Ammonius.\nAnd on this day also died Abba Hor, the disciple of Abba ‘Amoni (Ammonius), and Abba\nDarama.  And on this day also are commemorated those who became martyrs with Heroda,\nand Zacharias of Antioch.\n\nSalutation to Hor, and to Abba ‘Amoni (Ammonius), who was an ascetic for forty years,\nand an adorer of Mary, who appeared unto him.\nSalutation to Abba Darama.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Batra (or, Zatra) Wangel, the Abbot of\nDabra Libanos, the sixteenth of the learned fathers.  This holy man was from his early\nyouth arrayed in innocence, like the angels, and he loved humility and meekness.  After he\nassumed the garb of the monk, he fought a good fight, and he was appointed shepherd of\nthe flock of our Lord Jesus Christ.  Then he died at a good old age, as on this day the\ntwentieth of Genbot.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and then\nshe hid herself in a place, which was near his cell until the evening.  And in the evening\nshe knocked at the door of his cell, and asked him to let her remain with him until the\nmorning.  And the saint was very sorry for himself, and he pondered in his heart deeply. \nAnd he said, “If I leave her outside the wild bests of the desert will eat her, and if I bring\nher in I shall have to suffer a warfare about her within myself.”  And after this he opened\n\nthe door to her, and he left her in that place, and went to another.  And the woman arrayed\nherself in her beautiful apparel, and she adorned herself and perfumed herself, and she\ncame to him and asked him to lie with her; and she said unto him, “No one will see me\nhere.”  And the saint knew that she was a snare of Satan, the Enemy, and he said unto her,\n“Wait a little for me until I look at the road, for if we do not fear God it is meet for us to\nfear men, who are like unto us.”  And he went out from her, and lighted a large fire, and as\nhe put his head into the flames time after time, he said to his soul, “If thou art able to bear\nHell, commit sin.”  And he tarried in coming to her, she went to him, and she saw him in\nthe flames burning his hands and his fingers and his feet.   And she was terrified, and\ndragged him out of the fire, and her sense returned to her, and she stripped off her raiment,\nand cast it away, and threw herself down at his feet and begged him to help her to save her\nsoul.  And he began to teach her, and to admonish her about the end of this fleeting world,\nand the desire thereof, and she repented with all her heart.  And he said unto her, “It is not\ndesirable for us to live together in the same place.”  And he took her to a house of virgins,\nand commanded the abbess to take charge of her, and she pleased God during the rest of\nlife, which remained to her.  And she reached a good old age, and received the gift of the\nHoly Spirit, and healed many sick folk.   And Saint Martianus, fearing lest the Enemy\nmight bring to him another woman, departed to an island in the river [Nile], and dwelt\nthere, and a certain owner of a boat used to bring him food, and buy the work of his\nhands.  And when the saint had dwelt there many days the boat belonging to that man sank\nin the river, and a certain woman hung on to one of the planks thereof, and the waves of\nthe river washed her to the island on which Saint Martianus lived.  And when he saw her\nhe was frightened, and was sorry, because he would have to dwell with her; but the word\nof God spoke to her, and he arrayed her in the garb of the nun.  And he prepared food for\nher, and he said unto her, “It is not desirable for us to dwell together in one place.”  Then\nhe left that island, and cast himself into the river; and a large monster of the river took him\nup and carried him over, and brought him to dry land. From that time onwards he never\nlived in [one] place, but wandered about in the mountains, and deserts, and uninhabited\ndistricts until he had traveled through one hundred and sixty countries.  He never stayed\none day in one place.  And after this he shut himself up in a cave, and when he knew that\nthe time of his death was nigh, he called the bishop and told him all that had happened to\nhim, and all his spiritual fight from the beginning to the end thereof; and the bishop\nmarveled at the great size of his body.  And before all this happened the angel of God had\nappeared to the bishop, [and told him] to think about the body of Saint Martinaus.  And\nafter this he delivered up his soul into the hand of God; and the bishop swathed him for\nburial and buried him with great honor.  And as for the woman who was on that island, the\nowner of the boat visited her until she died; and he came and found her body white as\nsnow, and he carried it to his own country.  Salutation to Abba Mardali.\nAnd on this day also died Abba Aaron, the Syrian.  This saint was a fighter from his youth,\nand at length the gifts of healing and working miracles were given unto him.   When\npilgrim monks came to him he used to cook for them young doves, and when they said\nunto him, “We do not eat flesh,” he would say words of blessing over the doves, and he\ndismissed them and they flew away.  And he built a monastery, and the water was a long\nway off down the mountain, and he prayed a prayer, and made the sign of drawing it up\nwith his hand, and so made the water to ascend.  One day Satan came to him to destroy\nhim with evil, and Abba Aaron, knowing the appearance of him by the grace of the Holy\nSpirit, which dwelt upon him, said unto him, “Come into this cave to dwell.”  And when\nSatan had come into that cave, one side of it fell on him and buried him, and a huge stone\nleaped upon him, and Satan was put to shame.  And also, when the governor of the city\ndied, did not he raise him up by his prayer?  And this father made a lion to carry four\nwater-jars on his back, and the lion drew water for him for a period of ten years; and then\nhe departed to God.  Salutation to Aaron, who made young doves, which had been boiled,\nto fly away.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Amos, the prophet, and Mardali.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and that place and its desert, and the well of water,\nwhich is the first there, became known as Matareya (Near Heliopolis).  And our Lord took\nJoseph’s staff, and broke it into little pieces and planted these pieces in that place, and He\ndug with His own divine hands a well, and there flowed from it sweet water, which had an\nexceedingly sweet odor.  And our Lord took some of the water in His hands, and watered\ntherewith the pieces of wood which He had planted, and straightway they took root, and\nput forth leaves, and an exceedingly sweet perfume was emitted by them, which was\nsweeter than any other perfume.  And these pieces of wood grew and increased and they\ncalled them “Balsan” (i.e. the balsam trees).   And our Lord Jesus Christ said unto His\nmother, the holy Virgin Mary, “O my mother, these Balsan, which I have planted, shall\nabide here for ever, and from them shall be [taken] the oil for Christian baptism, when\nthey baptized in the Name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.”  Thence they\nwent to the city of Behensa, and to a place, which is called Bet Iyasus, which is interpreted\n“House of Jesus”; and our Lord Jesus Christ dug there a well whereof the water cured\nevery sickness and every pain.  And He also set a sign in a certain well of the river of\nEgypt, which rose [in flood] every year.  At the time of prayer at which they offered up\nincense at mid-day to God by that well, as soon as the reading of the Gospel was ended the\nwater which was in the well would rise up and come to the mouth of the well; and they\nused to receive a blessing from it, and straightway the water would recede until it reached\nits former level; and the people used to measure by the cubit the height to which it rose\nabove its normal level at the bottom of the well.  If the height were twenty cubits, there\nwould be great abundance in the land of Egypt that year; if the height were eighteen or\nseventeen cubits, there would also be abundance, but if the height were only sixteen cubits\n\nthere would be a great famine throughout the land of Egypt.   And then they went to\n‘Eshmunayn, and our Lord broke the idols which were therein; and they dwelt there for a\nfew days with a man whose name was ‘Apelon.  And there were there some komol trees,\nand they bowed [their heads] before our Lord Jesus Christ, and they have remained bent\nuntil this day.  Thence they went to Debre Kuskuam, and they remained therein for six\nmonths, and our Lord placed a well therein, the water of which healed every sickness. \nAnd when our Lord had finished living in the land of Egypt the days which He wanted to\nlive there, that is to say, three years and six months, and Herod was dead, the angel of the\nLord appeared unto Joseph in a dream, and again he spoke to him, saying, “Rise up and\ntake the Child, and His mother, and depart to the land of Israel.”  When they returned from\nthat place, they came to the city of Mahareka; and having come to Mesr (Cairo), they\ndwelt in the cave, which is the church of Saint Sergius in Mesr (Cairo).  After this they\nwent out from Mesr (Cairo) and came to Matariyah, and they bathed there, and the well\ntherein which our Lord Jesus Christ made became holy and blessed from that hour, even as\nhas already been said.  And thence went forth the oil “Balasan,” [the plants of which] our\nLord planted, and with this oil Christian baptism is made perfect, and with it churches and\naltars, and sacred property are consecrated.  And with it they give relief and healing to all\nthose who are sick, and they present it as a gift to kings, who boast themselves of its\npossession.  And from this place they went to Mehdab.  And by His return was fulfilled the\nprophecy of Hosea the prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt have I called My Son” (Hosea\n11:1).  And it is meet to us to celebrate a spiritual festival on this day, and we should sing\non it the words of David the prophet, “God hath wrought signs in the land of Egypt, and\nwonders in the Field of Zoan” (Psalm 78:12).  And also, “He hath wrought in thee the\nsigns of Egypt, and in the Egyptians,” and with them.  “Glory be to God our Lord Jesus\nChrist, and to this Good Father, and to the Holy Life-giving Spirit, for ever and ever. \nAmen.”  Salutation to Thy coming to the land of Egypt.\nAnd on this day also died Habakkuk, the prophet, one of the Twelve Sons of the Minor\nProphets.  One day this prophet cooked some lentils in a pot, and as he was carrying the\npot, with some bread, to the men who were reaping in the fields outside the city, the angel\nof God appeared unto him, and said unto him, “Take this food to Daniel the prophet in the\nden of lions of the city of Babylon.”  And Habbakkuk said unto him, “I have not seen\nBabylon and I do not know the den therein.”  And the angel of God seized him by the hair\nof his head, as he was carrying the food, and brought him to the pit of the city of Babylon,\nwhich was shut, and he gave that food to Daniel and he ate; and immediately the angel of\nGod brought him back to the land of Judah.  Now he was a very old man.  When the\nchildren of Israel returned from captivity, and built the sanctuary, Habakkuk came to\nJerusalem, and they welcomed him with great joy, and they made the sanctuary beautiful\nand assembled to hear his prophecy.  And he opened his mouth in the Holy Spirit and said,\n“O God, I heard the sound of Thee and I was afraid.  I saw Thy work and I marveled.” \nAnd then he spoke in his prophecy concerning the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. \nAnd concerning His birth in Bethlehem of Judah, he saith, “God shall come from Mount\nFaran”; and then he continued his prophecy to the end and he wrote it and he mixed it with\nthe prophecy of the prophets.  And he dwelt in Jerusalem.  And a certain woman of the\nsons of Israel came unto him weeping, and she said unto him, “I had two sons, and certain\nmen required of them to worship idols, and they refused to do so, and the men killed them\nand cast their bodies out on the highway.”  And Habakkuk went forth with her to the place\nwhere the young men who had been killed were lying, and he besought God to give them\nback their souls; and God accepted his prayer, and made the two young men to live again. \nWhen the time drew nigh for him to die he called his kinsfolk, and told them that he was\ngoing to die.  And he continued to gaze upwards for the space of an hour, and behold a\ngreat arm, like the hand [and arm] of a man, opened the roof of the house, and came down\nfrom above, and reached itself out to his mouth, and took his soul.  And when Anastasius,\nthe Christian emperor, read the story of the strife of Habakkuk, he built a church in his\nhonor in the city of Kartas, in the north of Egypt, and it was consecrated as on this day. \nSalutation to Habakkuk. \nAnd on this day also the blessed and chosen fighter Abba Abkuelta became a martyr.  This\nsaint belonged to a noble family of the city of ‘Ensena, and he was a pure priest and a wise\n\nphysician, and he did great good to all the suffering folk who came unto him, and he\nhealed them without payment; moreover he also gave them food, and drink, and raiment,\nand anything of which they stood in need.  In those days Diocletian, the infidel emperor,\nsent orders into the region of Upper Egypt, to the governor whose name was Arianus that\nhe was to compel the men of that country to worship idols.  Thereupon they took this saint\nand carried him away from ‘Ensena to the city of ‘Eshmunayn, and set him before the\ngovernor.  And the governor spoke unto him with words of gentleness, in order to persuade\nhim to abandon the True Faith, but he count not make him do so.  And straightway the\ngovernor ordered his soldiers to torture him with divers kinds of tortures, and they did so,\nuntil his skin melted, and then they burnt him alive in the fire; thus he finished his\nmartyrdom on the twenty-fourth day of the month of Genbot.  And certain believers came,\nand swathed him for burial in costly cloths, and they buried him in one of the upper hills\nnear his city.  Salutation to Abba ‘Abkuelta.\nAnd on this day also took place the death of Eleazar, the priest, the son of Aaron.  And on\nthis day also are commemorated ‘Akledis (Clitas), and Teflas, and Da’ala Maryu.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

now Matata had three daughters; the name of the oldest was “Mary,” and\nthe second was called “Sofia,” and the third was “Hanna.”  Mary brought forth Salome,\nand Sofia brought forth Elisabeth, and Hannah brought forth our holy Lady, the Virgin\nMary.  And this Salome was brought up in the house of Joseph with our holy Lady, the\nVirgin Mary, and she ministered unto her, and she was not separated from her when our\nRedeemer was born.  When Joseph was thinking about our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary,\nand wondering how she had brought forth her Son, being a virgin, this Saint Salome made\nbold to touch the seal of Mary’s virginity, and her fingers were burned by divine fire; but\nas soon as she touched the Child she was healed, [and her fingers] became as before.  By\nthis sign Joseph knew that our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, was the God-bearer.  When\nHerod commanded that the children of Bethlehem should be killed, she made the Child\nand Joseph and His mother, the Lady Mary, to take to flight, and she became a participator\nin the trouble caused by Him, sometimes carrying Him in her arms, and sometimes\nwashing Him; and she ministered unto Him all His days--three and thirty years.  On the\nday of His Passion she was not separated from Him, and she lamented and wept, and on\nthe day of His Resurrection she saw Him before the Apostles saw Him.  And even in the\nupper chamber of Zion the Holy Spirit came down upon her and the holy women, and she\nmade many to believe on Him in the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ; and she received from\nthe Jews much derision and much enmity.  Salutation to Salome.\nAnd on this day also Saint Cotylus, a physician from the city of Antinoe, became a martyr. \nThis saint had a God-fearing father, and his mother also feared God; and his father was\ngovernor of the city of Antinoe.  He had no son, and he besought God frequently to give\nhim one, and at length He gave him this saint; and he admonished him and taught him the\nBooks of the Church.  This saint was pure from his youth up, and he was an ascetic, and\nfought the spiritual fight; he prayed many prayers, and his rule was to pray one hundred\nprayers by night, and one hundred prayers by day.  When he was grown up his parents\nwanted to see him married, but this he did not wish.  They had a daughter, whom they had\nbegotten after this holy man Cotylus, and they married her to Arianus, the governor of the\ncity of Antinoe, who succeeded the father of this saint.  Now when the father of Cotylus\nhad waxed old in days, he asked the emperor and the emperor removed him from his\noffice, and gave it to Arianus his son-in-law.  And when his father died, Cotylus built a\nhouse wherein pilgrims were received, and then he learned the books of medicine, and\nbecame a physician; and all the sick folk came to him, and he healed them without\npayment.  When Diocletian denied Christ, Arianus joined him in his denial, in order to\nkeep his office, and he used to torture the martyrs.   And this Saint Cotylus yearned to\nbecome a martyr, and he went to the governor’s Council, and cursed Arianus, and the\nemperor, and their gods, which were idols; but Arianus was not able to do him any harm\nbecause of his sister [who was his wife], but he sent him to the city of Behensa, where the\nsaint remained in the prison house for three years.  And Cotylus sent to his sister, and she\ndelivered him from the prison house.  After Arianus, another governor was appointed, and\n[Arianus] told him the story of this Saint Cotylus.  And the governor sent and had him\nbrought, and he was angry with him, and said unto him, “If thou wilt not cast incense to\nthe gods I will torture thee with very great severity.”  And the saint said unto him, “I will\nnot cast incense to unclean idols, but only to my Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Living\nGod.”  And straightway the governor was wroth, and he commanded the soldiers to torture\nhim with every kind of torture; but each time the angel of God came to him, comforted\nhim, and strengthened him to endure, and He healed him and worked many signs and\nwonders by him.  And when the governor was tired of torturing him, and Cotylus would\n\nnot change his opinion, he commanded the soldiers to cut off his head, and they cut it off,\nand the saint received the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  Then the\nmen of his house swathed him for burial, and they laid him in a beautiful shrine, and many\ngreat signs and wonders took place through his body therein.  Salutation to Cotylus.\nAnd on this day also Saint Abba Heroda became a martyr.  This holy man was from the\ncity of Sebastia and he lived in the days of the persecution of the Christians by Diocletian,\nthe infidel; now he was God-fearing from his youth.  One day whilst he was lying upon his\nbed, and thinking about God’s good pleasure, he said in his heart, “What doth it profit me\nto live in this fleeting world?  I have heard the voice of my Lord Jesus Christ, Who saith in\nthe Holy Gospel, ’He who denieth not this world and what is therein is not able to devote\nhimself to Me (Matthew 16:24).  And now, I will arise, and I will go and pour out my\nblood for the Name of my Lord Jesus Christ.”  And as he was thinking these thoughts in\nhis heart, behold Saint Michael, the archangel, came to him, and said unto him, “Peace be\nunto thee, O holy and blessed Abba Heroda!  Be not afraid, for behold our Lord Jesus\nChrist hath prepared for thee a crown and a throne of glory, in the kingdom of the\nheavens.  I am Michael, the archangel, and I will go with thee to the place of torture, and\nno torture whatsoever shall prevail over thy holy flesh.”  And when Saint Michael had said\nthese things to him, he gave him the benediction of peace and went up into heaven.  And\nthe blessed Abba Heroda went outside his city, a little to the west, and turning his face\ntowards the east he prayed, saying, “I beseech Thee, O Father, Sustainer of the universe,\nand Thee, O Only Son, my Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom be praise and all blessing from my\nmouth, for to Thee praise is meet, I beseech Thee to strengthen me so that I may finish that\nwhich I have determined to do for Thee.”  And having said this he went to the governor’s\nCouncil, and cried out boldly, saying, “I am a Christian.”  And the governor said unto him,\n“So thou art a Christian?  Where is thy country?  Who art thou?  What is thy name?  And\nwhat is thy nation?”  And Saint Abba Heroda answered and said unto him, “I am a man of\nthe city of Sebastia and from the province of Behensa, and from my youth I have been a\nsoldier in the service of the king.”  And Lucianus the governor said unto him, “Art thou\nready to sacrifice to the gods Apollo and Artemis?  If thou wilt do this I will promote thee,\nand I will honor thee more than any other soldier, and I will give thee much money.”  And\nSaint Abba Heroda answered and said unto him, “O fool, it is written in the Holy\nScriptures thus:  Woe be unto the man whose confidence is in man and blessed is the man\nwhose confidence is in God (Psalm 40:4), and in the Name of the God of heaven and\nearth.  I will not offer sacrifice to unclean idols, for my hope is God.”  And straightway the\ngovernor was wroth, and he commanded his soldiers to scourge him, and to torture him. \nAnd they beat the saint with rods of iron, and with stakes of the thorn tree, until his blood\nflowed down on the ground like water; but the saint suffered no pain whatsoever from\nthese tortures, for God was with him.  And straightway Saint Michael the archangel came\ndown to him from heaven, and he touched the body of the saint, and healed his wounds,\nand made him whole.  When the people saw this miracle they believed on our Lord Jesus\nChrist, and became martyrs; and they were in number five hundred men.  And when the\ngovernor became tired of torturing him he commanded the soldiers to cut off his head with\nthe sword.  Thereupon the soldiers put a bridle in his mouth, and they carried him away to\ncut off his head with the sword.  And our Lord Jesus Christ appeared unto him and said\nunto him, “Peace be unto thee, O blessed Heroda!  I am Christ thy God; fear not, for a\nthrone hath been prepared for thee with the saints in the heavens.  Verily I say unto thee\nthat whosoever shall commemorate thy toil, and make an offering, and give alms to the\npoor on the day of thy commemoration, shall not have one barren animal among his\nflocks, and sons shall not be wanting in his house, and Satan shall never have any power\nover any of his works.  Or whosoever shall write the history of thy strife and martyrdom,\nhis name will I write in the Book of Life, and I will destroy the bond of his debt.  I will\ndeliver from all his tribulation the man who is in tribulation, when he maketh mention of\nthy name; and whosoever shall celebrate thy commemoration I will forgive all his\ntransgressions.  My peace shall be with thee.”  When our Redeemer had said these things\nHe went up into heaven with great glory.  And Saint Abba Heroda rejoiced with a great joy\nat the end of his fight, and he turned to the people who were following him, and said unto\nthem, “If there be among you a man who feareth God, let him take my body and lay it up\n\nby him; for a great blessing shall rest upon the place wherein my body resteth.”   And\nstraightway he stretched out his neck, and they cut off his holy head with the sword, and\nhe received the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens on the twenty-fifth day\nof the month of Genbot.  And after seven months his kinsfolk came and took the body of\nthe saint, and brought it to the city of Sebastia and laid it in a shrine, which they had built\nfor it; and through it many signs and miracles took place, and many sick folk were healed. \nSalutation to Abba Heroda.  Salutation to the thirty thousand souls who were hacked to\npieces with knives, or died by the sword.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Saint Balanus, and ‘Alontran (Elantherius), and\nRomanus, and two hundred and fifty martyrs, and the Emperor Constantine, and his\nmother Helena. \nAnd on this day our Lord planted pieces from Joseph’s rod in the place Bisos, and they\ngrew and became trees.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

now that governor was a friend of the king.  And he\nasked Thomas, saying, “Tell me what handicraft thou knowest.”  And Thomas said unto\nhim, “I am an architect, and I can build temples and palaces.  I am also a carpenter and I\ncan make implements for use in the fields, and seats, and other things [in wood].  I am also\na physician, and I can heal the sick who are smitten with sores.”  And when his master\nheard the words of Thomas, he was pleased exceedingly, and said, “I have gotten a slave\nwho will be of use to the king.”  And at that time that governor set out to go to the king,\nand he left Saint Thomas to build in the house.  And Saint Thomas began to teach the\nmistress of the governor the way of God, and he commanded her to walk in purity, and he\nmade her to understand the mystery of the Son of God; and she believed on his words, and\nmany of the men of the house also believed.  And when Thomas’s master returned from\nthe king, and saw Saint Thomas the apostle, he said unto him, “O wicked slave, where is\nthe fine work which thou didst tell me thou wouldst make for me?”   And Thomas\nanswered and said unto his master, “My lord, I have not lied unto thee.  As for the temples\nand palaces which I have built [for thee] they are the souls who have become temples for\nthe King of glory, and the ploughing implements which I have fashioned for thee are the\nHoly Gospels which shall plough up the thorny growth and weeds of sin.   And the\nmedicines, and the means of healing, are the Holy Mysteries, the Body and Blood of our\nLord Jesus Christ, which heal those who have been poisoned with the deadly poison of\nsin.”  And when the governor heard this he commanded the soldiers to lay him down on\nthe ground, and to tie his hands and feet together with ropes, and to drag him along on the\nlower part of his back, and to tie him by these ropes to a stake, and to cut off his skin with\nknives, and to fill the inside of his body with salt, and vinegar, and the dust of burnt bricks;\nand they did as the governor commanded, and the saint endured all these things with the\nendurance which was from God.  And when his mistress saw them flaying him from the\nwindow of her house, she fell down straightway, and delivered up her soul [to God].   And\nwhen Lucius knew that his wife was dead, he was exceedingly sad.   And as for Saint\nThomas, the apostle, God cooled his wounds and healed his body.  And Lucius said unto\nhim, “Behold, my wife hath died through thee, and if thou wilt raise her up from the dead,\nI will believe in thy God.”  And Saint Thomas, the apostle, came to her, and he laid his\nskin upon her, saying, “O Arsonia, in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, rise up!”  And\nshe opened her eyes straightway, and she rose, and stood up, and did homage to Saint\nThomas, the apostle; and when Lucianus (sic) saw this, he believed on our Lord Jesus\nChrist.  And all the men of his house and all the men of the city believed on our Lord Jesus\nChrist, and Thomas baptized them in the Name of the Father and the Son and the Holy\nSpirit; and he appointed bishops and priests over them, and built churches for them.  And\n[he remained] with them for four months, and confirmed them in the True Faith, and on\neveryone who was sick, no matter what the sickness was, he laid his skin, and he became\nhealed straightway.  Then the saint went forth from them and came to the city of Kontaria. \nAnd as he was going in he found al old man weeping bitterly, and the saint said unto him,\n“Why dost thou weep in this manner?”  And the old man answered and said unto him, “I\nhad three sons whom the king slew for the sake of their money.   And I am in debt to\ncertain men but have not the wherewithal to pay them.  If only one of these sons had been\nleft to me, he would have helped me to live.”  And the saint gave him his skin, and said\nunto him, “Lay this upon thy sons”; and when the man did as the saint commanded him,\nthe three sons rose up from the dead straightway.  And this miracle was noised abroad\nimmediately in all the cities.  And the priests of the idols were filled with wrath, and they\nstoned Saint Thomas, the apostle, with stones, and their hands withered.   And they all\n\nbelieved on our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Saint baptized them with Christian baptism, and\nhe taught them the Law of the Church.  And after this Thomas went to the city of Kenas,\nand to the city of Makedonya, and he preached to the men therein in the Name of the Lord\nJesus Christ.  And when the kings and governors heard about them, they seized him, and\nshut him up in prison.  Now the king had a wife, and she and many of the people who were\nwith her came unto the saint secretly, in prison; and he taught them the way of God, and\nmany believed on his words.  And the king was exceedingly angry because of his wife, but\nhe could not kill the saint among his people, and therefore he had him taken outside the\ncity; and he commanded four (?) of his soldiers to spear him with their spears, and they\nspeared him until he delivered up his soul. And the king’s son stood by looking on at\nthem.  And when the men of the city knew [this], they came to deliver Thomas from the\nhands of the soldiers, and they found that he had delivered up his soul; then they swathed\nhim for burial and laid him in one of the royal tombs.  Then a Satan leaped upon the king’s\nson, and he fell into an epileptic fit.  And [the servants of the king] came to the body of\nSaint Thomas, the apostle, to take away a little piece of his grave clothes, to hang over the\nbody of the king’s son.  And when they opened the door of the tomb, they could not find\nthe body of the saint therein, for God had translated it; and they took some of the dust\nfrom his tomb in faith, and they hung it up over the king’s son, and he recovered\nimmediately.  And Saint Thomas the apostle appeared unto many of the men of that city,\nand made them to know that he was alive, and that our Lord Jesus Christ had received\nhim, and he commanded them to be strong in the True Faith, in the Name of the Father and\nthe Son and the Holy Ghost.\nThe First Miracle of Saint Thomas.  There was a certain God-fearing priest of the country\nof Egypt who went to the country of India to trade.  And on the twenty-sixth day of the\nmonth of Genbot, which is the night of the festival of Saint Thomas, the apostle, he saw\nmany people assembling on the bank of the river, wherein was an island on which Saint\nThomas was, and at that moment a mighty wind storm came, and swept the water away. \nAnd all the people set out and went into the church of Saint Thomas, which was on the\nisland, and they found the verger of the church had died at that very moment; and they\nswathed him for burial, and buried him, and they prayed all that night.   And on the\nfollowing day, which was the twenty-seventh day of the month of Genbot, and the festival\nof Saint Thomas, they partook of the Offering.  And when the consecration was over, and\nthe prayer of breaking the bread was said, they placed the Holy Body of our Lord in the\nhand of Saint Thomas, the apostle, the hand being alive and undecayed, and the people\ncame one by one to received the Holy Mysteries from his hand.   And as they were\nreceiving the Offering, there came a certain man from among the laity to receive, and the\npalm of the saint’s hand was closed tightly over the Holy Body.  And they all cried out\n“Kyrie-eleison” many times, and they prayed for a long time, and [then] the palm of the\nsaint’s hand opened, and administered the Holy Mysteries to that man, and all the people\nlikewise received the Holy Mysteries; and they went out from the church, and returned to\ntheir houses in the peace of God.  And at that very moment the storm of wind returned and\nbrought back the water to is former place and height; and this has happened each year and\nit happeneth at the present day.  Salutation to Thomas, who was prepared to thrust his hand\ninto the wound made by the spear in the Lamb.\n[The scribe has omitted nos. 2-6 of the Miracles of St. Thomas.  They will be found in the\nGedle Hawaryat, ed. Budge, Contendings of the Apostles, 1899-1901, Vol 2, pp. 419-455.]\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Alphaeus, the martyr, and Zacharias, the\nanchorite, and Saint ‘Arsonwa, the wife of Lucius (or, Lucianus), the governor.  Salutation\nto ‘Arsonwa.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and they brought him to the monastery and buried him\nthere.  And this brother had afflicted his body so heavily with ascetic labors that he became\nlike dry wood.  And then he made an agreement with me that he should go to the desert,\nand he said unto me, “On the fourteenth day of the month of Nehasse, come to me and\nthou wilt find me.”  And on the day, which he had appointed to me I went to him, and I\nfound him, and he said unto me, “I am going to die and to depart to my fathers.  And three\noxen shall come to thee, and do thou lift my body on to their backs, and they shall lead\nthee to the monastery, by the Will of God, and bury me by my abode”; and it happened\neven as he said, and innumerable signs and wonders were made manifest at his tomb.\nAnd on this day also died Saint Amette Christos, the woman who fought the spiritual fight,\nand rejected the world, and vanquished the carnal desire, even as Abba Daniel hath related\nunto us, saying:  When I was living in the desert of ‘Aaref, and was walking about at night\nby the light of the moon, I saw the figure of a man sitting on a hill, and his hair entirely\ncovered his body.  And I said in my heart, I will go and see what this is, and I went close to\nthe figure to look at it.   When it saw me it withdrew into a hollow of the rock, and\nstraightway I knew that the figure was a man.  And I said unto him, “I entreat thee, O man\nof God, to come out so that I may receive thy blessing”; but he remained silent.  And I\nasked him to do so again and again, and then he said unto me, “Forgive me, O father, but I\ncannot come out.”  And I said unto him, “Why not?”  And he said unto me, “Because I am\na woman, and I am naked.”  When I heard this I took off the garment, which I had about\nme and I threw it to her, and she put it on; and she came out and we prayed.  And I said\nunto her, “Tell me, O my mother, why thou hast come out here, and how thou didst find\nthis hollow.”  And she said unto me, “I was a virgin in my father’s house, and I lived in\nJerusalem, and there was a certain monk who visited me frequently and who held converse\nwith me.  And after few days I went and lived with him.  And I saw him weeping, and\nconfessing his sin before God; when I knocked he did not open to me, but he continued to\nweep and to repent.  When I heard him I said in my heart, ‘Why do I not weep and repent\nfor my shame and disgrace?’  And I departed quickly to my house, and I put on sackcloth\n\nand I took a basket of beans and a vessel of water, and I prayed at the tomb of our Lord\nJesus Christ, saying, ‘O mighty and powerful God, Who art everlastingly marvelous, Who\ndost save those who are destroyed, and dost raise up those who have fallen, and Who dost\nhearken unto those who cry unto Thee, send forth Thy compassion and Thy righteousness\nto save Thine handmaiden, who doth put her trust in Thee, and visit Thy wretched\nhandmaiden, and accept my repentance, and bless this food and this vessel of water so that\nthey may last me for the rest of my days, so that my thoughts about the salvation of my\nsoul may not be brought to naught through my belly.’  And I went to Golgotha, and prayed\nthis prayer, and I went forth and cast myself upon God, and I came to Jericho, and I went\non until I reached the Red Sea.  Thence I came into this desert, and I found this hollow in\nthe hill, and I said, ‘This is my habitation, which God hath prepared for me.’  And behold,\nfor eight and thirty years I dwelt in this desert, and I have never seen any man save\nthyself.  And this basket of beans and this vessel of water whereon I live have neither\nbecome exhausted nor diminished during these eight and thirty years; my apparel became\nold and worn out, but this hollow hath taken the place of apparel, and become a covering\nfor me; and neither the heat of the sun in summer nor the cold of the winter have troubled\nme all my days.”  After this she besought me to eat and to drink, and I ate from the basket,\nand I drank from the vessel, and their contents were not diminished, and I gave thanks to\nGod.  I wanted to leave my garment with her, but she refused to accept it, saying, “Bring\nme a beautiful one.”  Then I went to the monastery, and told the abbot, and he cried out,\nsaying, “He who hath two garments let him give one to him that hath none”; and they\nbrought to him what he wanted.  And having taken them I departed straightway so that I\nmight see Amatte Christos.  And I toiled very hard in searching for her, but I count not find\nher.  And after a few [days] certain old men came and said, “As we were journeying along\nthe road of the Red Sea, in the Tanitic Desert, we saw a woman sitting by a rock towards\neventide, and we ran so that we might be blessed by her, and she fled and withdrew into a\ncave, and we went close to the mouth of the cave but could not see her.  And we found a\nbasket of beans and a vessel of water, and we ate, and the beans came to an end\nimmediately.  And we stayed there all night until the morning, and we searched for the\nsaint, so that we might be blessed by her, and we found her dead, and her hair covered her\nbody.  And we bowed low, and buried her in the cave and covered her face with a stone,\nand we came away blessing God that He had thought us worthy to find her, and to bury the\nblessed saint.”  When I heard this I knew that she must be the woman whom I found.  And\nI told the old men what she had told, me, and they glorified God Who had helped the weak\nvessel to overcome the Enemy and all his fiends.  Salutation to ‘Amette Christos.\nAnd on this day also the body of the holy and honorable Abba Epiphanius arrived in the\ncity of Cyprus.  Now this saint died on the eighteenth (sic) day of the month of Genbot,\nwhilst he was on the ship, and before he arrived at the city of Cyprus, according to what\nSaint John, the Mouth of Gold (i.e. Chrysostom), had prophesied concerning him, that is to\nsay, that he would not reach his Episcopal throne [again].  And having died during the\nvoyage, they carried him in the ship, and brought him to the city of Cyprus.   And the\npriests, and all the people, came with the Book of the Gospels, and crosses, and lamps, and\ncensers, and incense, and hymns of praises, and psalms, and laments, and dirges, and they\nbore along the body of the pure saint, and finally laid it in the church.  And the priests\nwanted to dig a grave for him in the church, but two deacons, whom the saint had\nexcommunicated some time before because of their evil work, opposed their wish, and\nprevented those who wished to dig a grave for him from doing so.  And the body remained\nin the church four days, and did not emit the odor which dead bodies are wont to emit, but\nit remained as if the saint were asleep.  And a certain holy deacon rose up, and said unto\nthe holy body, “I know that thou enjoyest grace before God, and that thou art able to\novercome all the evil men who oppose thee”; and then he seized the pick and smote the\nground therewith.  And behold straightway the two wicked deacons fell upon their faces\non the ground, and they were nigh to died; and men carried them into their houses, and\nthey died on the third day.  And the priests swathed the body of the saint with beautiful and\ncostly cloths, and they anointed it with divers sweet unguents, and they laid it in a noble\nstone coffin, and then they buried him in the church. And there appeared from out of his\n\nbody great signs and miracles similar unto those, which he had been wont to perform\nbefore his death.  Salutation to the arrival of the body in the city of Cyprus, O Epiphanius.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Abba Senta, and ‘Agabos the martyrs.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

Then he went up on the top of a large (high?)\npillar, and he stood up on the front of it for five and forty years; and all the days of his life\nwere five and eighty years.  [He lived] in his father’s house for six years, and nine and\nseventy years he passed in the spiritual fight.  As for his miracles, who can describe them? \nNow many of his miracles are written in the story of his strife.  And this father composed\nmany Homilies, and Admonitions, and Sayings, which are profitable for the monastic life,\nand for the salvation of the soul; and he translated (or, expounded) many of the Books of\nthe Church, and died in peace.  Salutation to Simon whose life, before he was conceived,\nwas foretold by John the Baptist.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Abba ‘Afse, and Abba Guba, who were of the\nninety saints of ‘Engelga, and Isaac, the monk, and the death of Alexander the king, the\nson of Philip.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

but now he hath departed,\nand is far away, I want to lie with thee.”  And ‘Arwa said unto him, “Even if my husband\nhath departed, and is far sway, is God far away?  Even if my husband cannot see me, God\ncan see me from heaven.”  And he went forth from her, and a devil met him [and said unto\nhim . . .] “Get thee back to her, and I will perform all thy desire for thee.”  And he went\nback to her and said unto her, “Wilt thou consider [this]?  If thou wilt lie with me I will\ntreat thee well, but if thou refusest me I will bring upon thee a beating.”  And ‘Arwa said\nunto him, “What canst thou bring upon me?”  And the man said unto her, “I will set up\nagainst thee a witness from among the nobles of Israel.”  And she said unto him, “For what\nreason wilt thou set up [this] witness against me?”  And he said unto her, “Because thou\nhast married another man.”  And ‘Arwa said unto him, “I will not lie with thee.  Thou art\nmy husband’s brother.  Say what thou wishest, but God will deliver me from thy hand.” \nAnd when she refused him, he went on the following day to the governor, and to the\n\npeople, and they all gathered together, and he said unto them, “The wife of my brother has\nmarried another man whilst her husband is away traveling.”  And they brought out ‘Arwa,\nand set up witnesses, and the brother said unto them, “Did ye see her lying with a man?” \nAnd certain false witnesses said, “We saw her lying with a man.”   And the governor\ncommanded them to bring her outside [the city], and they dragged her by the neck of her\ngarment.  And the governor and the people stoned her with stones, and the blood ran down\nfrom her face, and she died, and they buried her because of her beauty.  Now formerly the\nchildren of Israel would not bury the dead body of a person whom they had stoned, but\nthis woman they buried.  And a certain Egyptian merchant came that way with five loaded\ncamels, and he heard a voice in that grave, and he went to look at the grave, and he found\n‘Arwa lying in the grave, and her face was shining like the sun.  And when she saw him\nshe gave him her hand, and she said unto him, “Lift me up, and give me water to drink.” \nAnd he lifted her up, and gave her water to drink; and he took her to his abode, and had a\nphysician brought, and the physician healed her, and she became very much stronger then\nbefore.  And the Egyptian loved her, and said unto her, “Come, lie with me.”  And ‘Arwa\nsaid unto him, “Fear God and love thyself.   Dost thou never think about the Day of\nJudgment, and the end of the world?  I will not lie with thee.  Why should I wrong my\nhusband?”  And the Egyptian left her, and went out.  And the slave of the Egyptian, a\nHebrew, came and said unto her, “I want to marry thee.”  And ‘Arwa said unto him, “Get\nthee gone from me, dog that thou art!”   And the Hebrew departed from her.   And the\nEgyptian had a boy, an only son, and he had no other child, and the Hebrew, the slave of\nthe Egyptian, killed the boy with a hatchet, and carried the body to the place where ‘Arwa\nslept, and laid it down by her, and he placed the hatchet within reach of the grasp of her\nhand.  Now the Hebrew wished to kill ‘Arwa because she refused to lie with him.  When\nthe mother of the child woke up, she missed her son, and wishing to give the child suck\nshe searched for him and found him dead by the bed of ‘Arwa, whom the Hebrew made\nout to have committed the deed; and ‘Arwa herself lay there sleeping.  And the mother of\nthe child came out, and wept with a loud voice, and all the people assembled, and came to\n‘Arwa.  And the Egyptian said unto her, “Why hast thou done evil to me and killed my\nson?  I saved thee from death and raised thee up from the grave.”  And ‘Arwa said unto the\nEgyptian, “Thou didst entreat me well, and didst raise me up from the grave.  Why should\nI kill thy son in return for the good, which thou didst do me?  Was it evil that I wished thee\nwhen some time ago thou didst ask me to let thee marry me?  Nay, I refused because I\nfeared God.  Shall I commit a greater sin and kill a soul?  I have not killed thy son.”  And\nthe Egyptian said unto her, “Get thee out, and be gone from me”; and she went out.  And\nhe gave her one hundred dinars wherewith to maintain herself, and he said unto her, “Be\ngone, for I cannot contain myself in this matter; I know [not] what hath come upon me”,\nand she departed.  And as she was going along she came to a city where she saw a man\nbeing hanged on a tree, and she said unto those who were hanging him up, “Why are ye\nhanging that man?”  And they said unto her, “Because he hath carried off our money”; and\nshe said unto them, “How much money hath he taken?”  And they said unto her, “One\nhundred dinars”; and she gave them the money, and said unto them, “Take him down from\nhis cross.”  And the man from the cross went and said unto [his creditor], “Who paid thee\nmy debt of one hundred dinars and redeemed me?”  [And his father said unto him], “I thy\nfather did not redeem thee, but a woman, a widow, redeemed thee.”  And the young man\nwent and followed ‘Arwa, and he found her, and said unto her, “What beauty!  I wish to lie\nwith thee.”  And ‘Arwa said unto him, “I have delivered thee from the fire of earth, and\nthou wishest to bring me into that which is in the heavens, and thou dost not counsel me\nfor good”; and when he saw that she feared God he left her.  And he went to several of the\nman on a ship in the sea, and he called them and said unto them, “There is a handmaiden\nwhich I will buy with all my money, and I will sell her to you if ye will pay me my price”;\nnow he had seen ‘Arwa, and her beauty, and her pleasing face.  And there was a certain\nman there with much gold, that is to say one hundred dinars, and the man whom ‘Arwa\nhad redeemed from hanging sold her to that man with the money.   And the man who\nbought her made her to embark in a ship, and he loved her, and wanted to lie with her; and\nhe took her hand.  And the sun became dark, and the winds blew with great violence, and\nthe waves rose up, and were about to sink the ship.  And all those who were in the ship\ncried out, and they wept, and prayed to God.  And ‘Arwa said, “Thanks be to God, He who\n\nputteth his trust in God shall not die, and he who believeth in Him shall not perish.”  And\n‘Arwa said unto those who were in the ship, “O ye who didst buy me wrongfully!  O ye\nwho didst sell me wrongfully!   I am not a handmaiden, but a woman who is her own\nmistress.   If ye will do what I tell you I will pray to God to guide you out of this\ntribulation”; and they said, “We will do what thou tellest us to do.”  And she said unto\nthem, “This man who sold me did so because I would not let him lie with me; this is an act\nwhich God doth not desire.”  And all the men brought out money, ten thousand dinars, and\nthey gave it to the man who had bought her, and he set her free.  And ‘Arwa prayed to\nGod, and the storm died down, and the winds stood still, and there was a complete calm. \nAnd they all loved her and wanted to fall upon her, and [each] of them said, “I, I.”  Then\nstraightway there came a mighty wind, which broke their ship in pieces, and they were all\nscattered about in the sea and they sank; and all their money was left with her.  And she\nmade pantaloons, and oiled herself (?) like a man, and she arrayed herself in her apparel,\nand departed in a ship.  And she came to a large island, and a city of men, in the midst of\nthe sea, and she went on and came at length to the king.  Now when the king saw ‘Arwa,\nhe thought that she was a young man, whose beard had not yet sprouted.  And she said\nunto the king, “Behold, my money is much, there is a ship full [thereof].   Those who\nowned it have perished, and sunk in the sea, and as thou seest, I am left alone a weak\nwoman; and all the money, which they left, is with me in my hand.  I am afraid that I shall\nbe destroyed, and I wish thee to take charge of it.  I will write a letter, and will send to the\nmen belonging to the house of each of the dead men, and then their kinsfolk can come and\ntake the money [from thee], each man taking what is his.”  And when the king saw that she\nhad not stolen their money, and that she was beautiful . . .he took all the money.  And the\nfear of God came upon ‘Arwa, and God heard her petition, and many sick persons were\nhealed by her prayers.  And she went to the seashore, and entered a cave and lived [there]\npraying to God.  And the king of that island fell sick, and came [nigh unto] death.  And all\nthe people gathered together and went to him, and they said unto him, “Behold, thou art\ngoing to die; who wilt thou appoint to be king after thee?”  And he answered and said unto\nthem, “There is a young man who brought me much money in a ship, and him do I appoint\nto be king over you after me”; and they were all pleased, and they said, “He shall reign\nafter thee.”  And they finished their business, and the king died.  After this they made\n‘Arwa to reign over them, and they believed her to be a young man, and she was worthy to\nreign, and love for the kingdom entered into her heart.  And again she thought in her heart,\nsaying, “The kingdom will make me to be remote from God,” and she wanted to refuse [to\nreign] over them.   And she gathered the people together, and said unto them, “Those\namong you who have daughters, or sisters, adorn them with gold, and array them in\nraiment of fine linen, and precious stones, and bring them hither to me; and the maiden\namong them whom I shall choose shall be my wife.”  And they all brought their sisters and\ntheir daughters before her, even as she commanded them, and they were all adorned with\ngold and gems, and they set them before ‘Arwa; and the mothers went forth leaving their\ndaughters with her.  And ‘Arwa stripped off her apparel, and stood up naked before the\nmaidens; and when they saw that she was a very beautiful woman, they marveled and held\ntheir peace.  Then they said, “We are well pleased that she shall reign, and that she shall\nnot marry a man, and that she shall not assume the apparel of a man; we are well pleased\nthat she shall reign.”  But she refused to do so, and went back to her cave.  And the report\nof her was heard in every country in those days, and of how she prayed to God, and healed\nthe sick by her prayer.  And after many days the husband of ‘Arwa came from afar into his\nhouse.  Now he was silly, and blind and a paralytic, and he found there his brother, and he\nsaid unto him, “What hast thou done with my wife ‘Arwa?”  And his brother said unto\nhim, “We found thy wife lying with a man, and we stoned her and killed her”; and the\nhusband of ‘Arwa was silent.  And after many days he heard the report of how she used to\nheal the sick by her prayers.  And the husband of ‘Arwa went to his brother, and entreated\nhim, saying, “There is a woman on a certain island who healeth the sick by her prayers,\nand God heareth her prayer; take me thither.”  And his brother said unto him, “Hast thou\nstrength enough to travel thither?”  And the husband of ‘Arwa said unto him, “Let us go,\nperadventure God will be merciful unto us”; and the two of them set out together.  And\nthey met the young man whom ‘Arwa had redeemed with one [hundred] dinars.  (Now he\nhad become blind), and also the Hebrew slave, who had slain the son of his mistress, and\n\nhad thrust the hatchet into the hand of ‘Arwa, and who was then leading his master the\nEgyptian, (who was ill and blind).  And the young man whom ‘Arwa had saved from his\ncross was leading his father, and the brother of her husband, who had stoned her with\nstones, was leading his brother, the husband of ‘Arwa.  And they all arrive before her, and\ncame into her presence, and ‘Arwa knew them all, but they did not know her; and she went\nback into her cave and then returned to them.  And her husband said unto her, “Behold, I\nwill give thee all the money thou wishest; heal me.”  And she said unto him, “I do not take\nmoney from sick people, but I will take it from thee; there is much sin with thy brother, let\nhim describe everything which he hath done.”  And the husband of ‘Arwa said unto [his\nbrother], “This woman speaketh well; confess all thy sin.”  And the brother of ‘Arwa’s\nhusband said unto him, “I visited thy wife, and asked her to let me lie with her and she\nrefused me.  And I set up four lying witnesses against her, and I made the people stone her\nwith stones, and I killed her.”  And ‘Arwa’s husband said unto him, “Thou didst entreat her\nevilly in killing my wife.  We had the same father and the same mother, and as for what is\npassed, what can I do?   Let it be forgiven thee.”   And ‘Arwa prayed to God, and her\nhusband’s eyes were opened, and his feet set free, and the whole body of the man whose\nbrother had killed ‘Arwa was made whole.  Then the father of the young man whom she\nhad saved from crucifixion said unto her, “My son hath become blind; pray to God on his\nbehalf.”  And ‘Arwa said unto him, “Thy son hath [committed] many sins; let thy son\nconfess the sins which he hath committed, and I will pray [for him].”  And the blind man\nsaid, “Thou sayest well; I will confess my sins.  A certain woman was journeying along the\nroad, and she found me hung on a tree, and she redeemed me for one hundred dinars.  And\nI loved her and I wanted to lie with her, and she refused to let me.  And I saw certain idle\nseamen on a ship, and I called them and sold her to them for ten thousand dinars.  And as\nsoon as I came away from them, my eyes went blind, and the dinars turned into stones.” \nAnd ‘Arwa said unto the young man before his father, “Thou art a liar [by nature], but God\nhath now made thee to speak openly”; and she prayed to God, and he was made whole,\nand his eyes were opened.  And then came the Egyptian, the master of the Hebrew slave,\nand he said unto ‘Arwa, “Thou seest that my slave is blind; pray to God that He may heal\nhim.”  Now the Egyptian did not know that ‘Arwa was the woman whom he had lifted up\nout of the grave.  And ‘Arwa said unto him, “His sin is great, and therefore he is blind and\nsick; let him now confess everything which he hath done and I will pray for him.”  And his\nmaster said unto the Hebrew, “Tell thy transgressions, and if thou wilt not tell the, I will\nleave thee here and return to my country.”   And the Hebrew said to his master, “An\nIsraelite woman sojourned with us, and I asked her that I might lie with her, and she\nrefused me.  And I killed thy son, and took him to her whilst she was sleeping, and I laid\nhim down by her, and I thrust the hatchet into her hand, and I wished thee to kill her\nbecause she would not let me lie with her.”  And having confessed his sin, ‘Arwa prayed to\nGod and the man was healed straightway.  Now there were men of that island, and others,\nnear her, and when their business was finished they returned to their district.  And her\nhusband was left alone with her, and she drew nigh unto him and said unto him, “Thy\nwife, of whom thou speakest, was she like me?”  And her husband answered and said unto\nher, “Thy nose, and eyebrows, and eyes resemble hers, and if she were not dead and buried\nI could imagine that thou wert she, and would grasp thee with my hands and carry thee\noff.”  And she said, “I am indeed thy wife ‘Arwa, whom they punished wrongfully, and\nwho was killed, and sold as a slave for thy sake.  For thy sake I endured the sun, and the\ncold, and the heat, and for thy sake I traveled over sea and land”; and when she had told\nhim this they were silent, and both of them wept.  And after this he asked her that he might\nlie with her, and she refused, and said unto him, “I cannot do it at this moment; I will wash\nand come to thee.”  And she rose up, and went to her cave and washed, and then came out. \nAnd having dressed herself in clean apparel, she prayed to God, saying, “If Thou lovest\nme receive my soul, and let me not lie again with a man”; and she bowed low and died. \nAnd her husband came in and found her dead, and he buried her.  Salutation to ‘Arwa.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated Dimadis the martyr.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and the old man said unto\nhim, “I have none here.”  But stay with the oxen, and I will go and fetch some for thee to\neat.”   And he said unto him, “Go in peace,” and when the old man went the apostle\nremained with the oxen, [and said,] “The man hath gone to do me a kindness.”  And he\nrose up, and seized the plough, and he cried out to the oxen so that he might plough.  And\nPeter, the chief of the Apostles, sowed for him, for he was with him then, and he blessed\nthe seed in the Name of our Lord and Redeemer Jesus Christ.  And Thaddeus ploughed\nthree furrows, and the seed germinated that day, and became ears filled with wheat.  When\nthe old man returned to the fields, and saw what the apostle had done, he fell down at his\nfeet and said, “Art thou God Who hath come down from heaven?”  And Thaddeus said\nunto him, “I am not God, but a servant of God.”  And that [old] man said unto him, “In\nreturn for the good which thou hast done for me I will follow thee whithersoever thou\ngoest.”  And the apostle said unto him, “It is unnecessary for thee to do this, but take thine\noxen and lead them back to their master, and make known to thy wife that I am here, and\nlet her prepare supper in your house, that I may eat; for I was to go into this city and tarry\n[there] this day for the Lord Jesus Christ hath called me.”  And the man took the ears of\ncorn from the fields, which the apostles had sown, and he came unto the city with his\noxen.  And when he came unto the city the men saw him carrying ears of corn, and they\nsaid unto him, “Where didst thou get these ears of corn this day?  Is it not the time for\nsowing?”  And he answered them never a word, and took back the oxen to their owner;\nand he came unto his dwelling, and they made ready a good [meal] for the apostle.  And\nthe story of the man came to the nobles of the city, and they sent to him, saying, “Where\ndidst thou get these ears of corn?  Tell us, that thou mayest not die an evil death.”  And he\nanswered and said unto them, “A certain man passed whilst I was ploughing”; and he told\nthem the whole story to the end.  And the nobles said unto him, “Go and bring him to us,”\nand the man said unto them, “Wait a little; he is coming to my house, and when he cometh\nye can see him.”  And Satan corrupted the hearts of the nobles, and they said, “Woe be\nunto us if this man be one of the Twelve Man who are magicians!  Rise up, let us go out to\nkill him.”  And other men answered and said, “We cannot kill him, for we have heard that\nJesus their God doeth what they want; but let us take a woman, and set her naked outside\nthe city; and when the apostle wisheth to come into the city and seeth her, he will not\nenter.”  And they brought a woman who was a harlot, and stripped her naked, and set her\nby the gates, and when the apostle had come to the gates of the city he saw the naked\nwoman, and she perceived that wickedness of her deed.  And the apostle prayed and said,\n“O my Lord Jesus Christ, send Michael the Archangel, and let him hang up this woman by\nthe hair of her head in the air whilst I enter the city”; and forthwith she was hung up by the\nhair of her head, and all the nobles saw her hanging, but they could not perceive what held\nher.  And she cried out and said, “God will judge the nobles of the city,” but none of the\nmen of the city believed her, because Satan had hardened their hearts.  And the apostle\nprayed to God and said, “O Lord, strengthen me to fight Satan, who hath risen up against\n\nme.”  And the apostle prayed, and Michael the Archangel came down and drove away the\nevil spirits, which vexed the souls of the men of the city.  And the apostle went about in\nthe city, and preached in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the men of the city\nbelieved; and straightway they took down the woman who was hanging in the air.  And\nafter this Thaddeus appointed bishops and priests over them, and he baptized them in the\nName of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.  And he appointed the woman who\nhad been suspended in the air to minister in the church, and he healed the sick, and opened\nthe eyes of the blind, and the dumb spoke, and the lame walked, and devils were driven\nout, and he raised the dead, and at length all the people of the city believed.  And Satan\nwas wroth, and he entered into the heart of a rich young man who loved money, and he\nsent him to the apostle.  And he came and bowed down before him, and said unto him, “O\nservant of God, I have much money, what am I to do that I may live?”  And the apostle\nsaid unto the young man, “Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul. \nSlay not, steal not, and fornicate not.  What thou wouldst not that men should do unto thee,\nthat do not to others; and sell thy possessions, and give [the price thereof] to the poor of\nthis city.”   And when the young man heard these words, his wrath against the apostle\nincreased, and he seized him by the neck, wishing to kill him, but this did not take place\nfor God strengthened him; and his eye did not go forth from his head under the tribulation\nof the choking.  And the apostle said unto him, “Our Lord saith, ‘It is as easy for a camel\nto go through the eye of a needle as for a rich man to go into the kingdom of heaven’”\n(Matthew xix, 24).  And the young man said unto him, “These words of thine are not true;\na camel cannot go through the eye of a needle.”  And at that moment a man who had with\nhim a camel passed before him, and the apostle seized him and made him stand still.  And\nthe apostle asked a certain tailor for a needle, and the tailor, wishing to help the apostle,\nbrought him a needle with a large eye.  And the apostle thanked [him] and said unto him,\n“Bring a needle with a small eye, so that the glory of God may be manifest in this city”;\nand the tailor did as he commanded him, and brought him a needle with a small eye.  And\nstraightway the apostle stretched out his hands and prayed to the Lord Jesus Christ, and he\nsaid, “Come thou and thy camel into the eye of this needle”; and the man and his camel\ncame into the eye of the needle.  And the apostle said, “Do it again so that all the people\nmay know”; and when the people saw this wonderful thing, they lifted up their voices and\nsaid, “There is no god except the Lord God of Thaddeus, the Apostle.”  And when the\nyoung man saw this, he bowed down with his face to the ground, and he asked the apostle\nto forgive him his sin, and to take all his possessions and distribute them among the poor. \nAnd the apostle did as he asked him, and taught him the Law of the Faith, and he baptized\nhim in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, and likewise all the\nmen of the city; and he administered unto them the Holy Mysteries, the Body of our Lord\nand His precious Blood.  And the apostle went forth from them, and they set him on his\nway and bade him farewell in peace.  After this he came to the country of Syria, and he\npreached therein, and many men believed through him.   And much tribulation and\npunishment came upon him from the Jews and the Gentiles; and then he died in peace. \nSalutation to Thaddeus.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

Behold, God will remove thy soul from thee, and thou\nshalt die in the hands of thine enemies.”  And the emperor said unto him, “O my lord, what\nshall I do?”  And they answered and said unto him, “Dost thou believe in the Passion of\nthe Son of God?” And he answered and said unto them, “I do believe.”   And they\nanswered and said unto him, “Send and fetch our son Coelestinus, and restore him to his\nthrone.”  When the emperor awoke from his dream he was afraid, and he wrote a letter,\nand sent it to Dimitrianus, saying, “Be not angry with me on account of Coelestinus. \nInstruct my messengers and cause them to come to the place where he liveth, so that they\nmay restore him to his office.”  And when the messengers of the emperor went they found\nSaint Coelestinus, and they restored him to the city of Rome with great honor, and the\npeople welcomed him with great joy.  And in those days the emperor returned from the\nwar victorious, and the Church was in a state of quietness and peace.  When Nestorius\ndenied God, and the General Council assembled [to deal] with him, Coelestinus was\nunable to attend the Council, because of his illness, but he sent two priests, who carried an\nepistle wherein he cursed Nerstorius, and excommunicated him.   Now the emperor\nbelieved in the words of Nestorius, and would have nominated him [archbishop], but he\nwas afraid of the archbishops.  And when God willed to give Coelestinus rest from the\nlabor of this world Yonaknidos (Innocentius) and Athanasius appeared to him, and said\nunto him, “Direct the people, for behold, thou shalt come to us; our Lord Jesus Christ\ncalleth thee.”   And when he woke up the commanded the people, and said unto them,\n“Take good heed to yourselves, for behold ravening wolves shall come into this city.”  And\nhaving said this he added, “Let us rise up and depart, for behold the saints are seeking for\nme and for two others, and we must go out from this world.”  And at that moment the two\nothers were Cyril, Archbishop of Alexandria, and Lucius, Bishop of the city of San\n(Tanis); and having said this he died in peace.  Salutation to Coelestinus.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and when this saint was born he\ncalled him John.  And he built first of all a church in the name of Saint John the Baptist. \nAnd when the boy was grown up and his days were twelve years, his father gave him his\nflock to tend.  And John used to give his food to the shepherds every day, and also to those\nwho passed by on the road, and he fasted until the evening daily.  And when his father\nheard this he went to him in the fields so that he might know if what people had told him\nabout him [was true], and the young man Saint John was afraid lest his father should beat\nhim, and he wanted to flee.  And his father said unto him, “Show me thy food [for] this\nday”; and John answered and said unto him, “Go inside that thou mayest see it.”  And\nwhen his father went inside, and [looked at] the place where things were put, he saw that it\nwas full of hot bread, and he marveled exceedingly and told his mother what had happened\nto their son.  And from that hour they knew that grace was on their son, and they no longer\nallowed him to tend the sheep.  And the saint studied and learned by heart many of the\nBooks of the Church.  And his parents asked him to let them arrange a marriage for him,\nbut he did not wish this.  And when his days were eighteen years, he was made a priest,\nand Simon, the son of his father’s brother, left the sheep and became his disciple, and he it\nwas who described his miracles.  Now God made manifest through him great miracles, and\nthe people used to bring unto him those who were sick with every sickness whatsoever,\nand he prayed over some olive oil, and anointed them therewith, and they were healed of\ntheir sickness.  And he rebuked the sick, and said unto them, “Many ills come upon you\nbecause of your sins”; and this saint wrought so many miracles that they cannot be\ncounted, and among them are the following:  A soldier took and carried off some barley\nfrom a widow woman.  And the widow came to the saint, and complained to him about the\nsoldier, and the saint cursed him, and his horse died when he had eaten the barley.  On one\noccasion the king’s general came to collect tribute, and he had with him a man, one of\nwhose eyes was blind.  And that man came to Saint John, and was blessed by him, and\nstraightway his eye that was blind was opened, and he saw well with it.  And this holy man\ncould see by the Holy Spirit the deeds of all men, and their sins were revealed to him, and\nhe rebuked them for their sins.  And the report of this saint was heard of by a king whose\nname was Marianus, who had an only daughter, and a serpent entered her belly, and grew\nup therein, and she was nigh to die; and although her father had given much money to the\nphysicians they were unable to cure her.  And the general made known to him the history\nof Saint John, and how he had opened the eye of his blind servant, and the king\ncommanded his soldiers to send and bring the saint.  And Saint John knew by the Spirit\nthat the king wanted to bring him to him, and he feared the fatigue of the journey and the\nsea.  And straightway a cloud caught him up from the city of Sarmalas, and carried him\nalong until it brought him to the city of Antioch, and set him upon the king’s bed; and\nwhen the king saw him he was troubled and was afraid.   And the saint told the king,\nsaying, “I am that poor man for whom thou didst wish to send and bring hither.”  [And the\nking brought] his daughter to Saint John, and he prayed over her, and the serpent went\nforth from her belly without injuring her, or causing her pain.  And the king, and all the\nmen of the house of the king were blessed by him, and they marveled exceedingly, and\nthey glorified God Who gave such grace to those who love Him and who do His\ncommands.  And the king offered him much money and gifts, but he would take nothing\nwhatsoever from him.  And the king wished to make him dwell with him, but could not\nmake him do so, and he laid hold upon his girdle so that he might [not] depart, and a cloud\ncaught him up whilst the king was holding his girdle in his hand, and the girdle broke in\n\nthe king’s hand, and Saint John arrived in his city that night.  And the king built a church\nover that girdle, and it is called “the church of the girdle” to this day.  When Saint John\nconsecrated the Offering he could distinguish between the sinners and the good, and those\nwho were fit to partake and those who were not.   When Diocletian denied Christ, and\nworshipped idols, this saint took Simon, the son of his father’s brother, and went to the\ncity of Alexandria, and confessed our Lord Jesus Christ before the governor.   And the\nsoldiers tortured them severely, and after this they cut off their heads with their swords. \nAnd their souls entered into everlasting rest, and their bodies are to this day in the city of\nGamnudi, where great miracles and healings take place through them.  Salutation to John\nand to Simon.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated the great saint Abba Isaiah the anchorite, of the\ndesert of Scete.  Salutation to Isaiah.\nAnd on this day also died Saint Abba Gabriel, the seventy-eighth Archbishop of the city of\nAlexandria.  This saint had believing and blessed parents, and they walked in the way of\nGod, and in His commandments, and according to His good pleasure.   And having\nbegotten him, they reared him in the fear of God.  One day there came to him certain holy\nmonks, and among them was a righteous elder whose spiritual fight was good.  And he\nsaw a beautiful vision, as it were many bishops surrounding the boy, and they laid their\nhands upon him, and blessed him, and they all said, “So be it, so be it.”  When the elder\nwoke up from his vision he meditated and said, “The boy shall become great.”  And he\nsaid unto his father, “Teach him well, for assuredly he shall become the head and chief of\nmany peoples; thou wilt not see him at all times.”  And he told him what he had seen; and\nthe father of the boy praised God, saying, “Shall anything happen to this boy?”  And when\nhis days were two (?) years his father died in the mercy of our Lord and God and\nRedeemer Jesus Christ.  Now the boy had an uncle whose name was Peter, and he was\nBishop of the city of Behna, and his spiritual fight was admirable, and he was learned in\nall the holy Books of God of the New and of the Old Testaments, and he took the boy and\ntaught him.  And all those who saw the boy marveled at the grace of God, which was upon\nhim, and at his understanding and knowledge, and he was made a deacon.  And when his\ndays were twelve years he wanted to put on the garb of the ascetic life, and he renounced\nthis fleeting world.  And the Bishop Abba Peter gave him into the hands of the blessed\nmonk Abba Peter the priest, and he became devoted to God, and a fighter, and a man of\ngood piety.  And he took the boy and taught him the spiritual fight, and the Rule of the\nmonastic life in a few days, and signs and wonders and spiritual excellence appeared\nthrough him; and many men loved him because of his spiritual fight, and his devotion to\nGod, and his humility.  And after the death of his teacher, Peter the priest, he departed to\nthe monastery of Saint Anthony, where he lived for many years, fighting the fight with\nfasting, and prayer, and vigils and unceasing prostrations; and after this he departed to the\ndesert of Scete, to the monastery of Abba Macarius.  And he became abbot of the church\nof our holy Lady, the two-fold Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, in the monastery of Marmos,\nand he toiled and restored the building thereof.  And then he went to Jerusalem, and was\nblessed in the holy places, and there he was made priest of the church of the Holy\nResurrection by the hand of the holy father Bishop Abba Michael.  Thence he returned to\nthe city of Mesr (Cairo), and dwelt in the church of Mu’Allakah of our holy Lady the\nVirgin Mary, copying the holy Books of the Holy Church.  In those days the throne of\nMark the evangelist remained without an archbishop for a few days, and all the bishops\nand priests agreed with one consent to make this saint archbishop.  And Satan, the hater of\nwhat is good, brought certain men who were envious of him, and they did not wish him to\nbe appointed, and they appointed archbishop the holy and spiritual father Abba Athanasius,\nwho is know as “Son of the Crown.”  And good works appeared from him, and he walked\nuprightly without blemish, like Abba Athanasius the apostle, and then he died.  And again\nthe bishops, and the elders, and the people gathered together, and they set their hands to a\ndocument and wished that Abba Gabriel should be appointed archbishop.  And again the\nEnemy of what is good stirred up dissension among the people, and they agreed that the\nname of Gabriel and the names of others should be written on papers, and that they should\nbe laid on the altar, and that they should pray over them for three days, and should\ncelebrate the Offering, so that God should make known who was to hold this honorable\n\nposition and reveal his name.   And they did thus, and they brought a little child, who\nbrought forth the paper whereon was the name of this father; and all the bishops assembled\nand made him prefect of the church of Mu’Allakah.  And again his appointment was not\ncompleted, and Abba John, who is known as the “son of ‘Absadi,” was appointed.  And at\nthat time the church of Egypt suffered great tribulation.  When Abba John was appointed,\nthis father Abba Gabriel went to the monastery of Saint Abba Anthony, and he fought a\ngreat fight, and devoted himself to fasting, and prayer, and vigils, and to prostrations by\nday and by night; and in the strenuousness of his fight he was superior to many.  And he\nlived thus one year (?).  And many of the holy monks saw beautiful visions concerning\nhim, and some of them said that they saw him in the city of Alexandria, dressed in\narchiepiscopal apparel, with many Christians and Gentiles surrounding him.  And some of\nthem saw him in the desert of Scete, where he was appointed head of the monastery of\nSaint Abba Macarius; and some of them saw a countless number of keys handed to him. \nMany times when he wished to come down from the monastery of Abba Macarius, he\nbecame sick, and was unable to come down.  And then Saint Anthony appeared unto him,\nin a vision, and said unto him, “I do not wish thee to go down from the monastery except\nby the Will of God, and henceforward thou shalt not go down except at His time.”  And\nwhen three years were ended, a certain holy elder of the monks of the monastery of\nAnthony saw the vision of a glorious angel, who said unto him, “Three years from this\ntime they shall take Abba Gabriel and make him Archbishop of the city of Alexandria”;\nand that elder went out straightway and told Abba Gabriel what he had seen.  One day the\ngovernor of the city of Tafih came to the monastery of Abba Anthony, and with him were\nthe abbot, and many judges (or, officers), and a letter from the emperor ordering them to\nbring Abba Gabriel quickly, and to make him Archbishop of the city of Alexandria.  And\nthey took him against his will, and carried him with great honor to the city of Alexandria,\nand with him were the father bishops; and all the people rejoiced in him.  And that day he\nand the bishops, and the priests and the deacons, appointed a bishop to Jerusalem, and\nafter this he consecrated Myron (i.e. the holy oil) three times; and he remained thus for one\nyear and on month.  At that time Abba Anthony appeared, and said unto him, “Behold, thy\ndeparture draweth nigh, and after one year and a half thou shalt depart to God and shalt\ninherit everlasting life.”  And at that time great tribulation came upon the Christians, and\nthis father asked God to deliver them from it; and God accepted his petition and delivered\nthem.  Then the archbishop returned to his throne, and Abba Gabriel hid himself in a secret\nplace, and no man knew where he was, except a certain believer.   And through the\nexcessive intensity of his spiritual fight, by night and by day, his appearance became\nchanged, and his body dried up.  And after this God revealed the matter of this father to a\ncertain believer, who pleased God by his works, and he became zealous for him with a\ndivine zeal, and he brought him out of that place, and established him in the church of the\nApostles, and he lived there for many days devoting himself to prayer and to sacred\nduties.   And he visited the sick, and provided them with what they needed, and he\ncomforted the believers who came to him.  One night Abba Athanasius, the archbishop,\nappeared unto him plainly, and said unto him, “Be not sad because of the labor and sorrow\nwhich hath come to thee, for God hath delivered thee from much toil and tribulation.  And\nbehold, there must come upon thee a sickness, so that God may perfect thy patient\nendurance; rejoice, however, for thou hast received the grace of God, which is great, and\nthou shalt receive everlasting life, and joy which is unending.”  And straightway a severe\nsickness seized him, and he continued to be sick, and he was frightened and disturbed\nabout the departure of his soul from his body, and about his standing before God.  And\nthere was before his face a picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and to this he prayed\ncontinually; and at that time God Most High appeared unto him with a shining face, and\ncomforted him, and strengthened him, and said unto him, “Fear not, but rejoice, for thou\nhast received the grace of the kingdom of the heavens.  At the end of three days thou shalt\ndepart from this fleeting world”; and after three days he died in peace, and was buried in\nthe church of Saint Mercurius with great honor.  Salutation to Gabriel the Archbishop.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and God wrought great and innumerable signs and wonders\nby his hands.  And he wrote two Epistles and sent them to the believers, and he spoke to\nMark and translated for him the Gospel, which is known as his.  Then he came into the\ncity of Rome, and he went up into the great theatre wherein all the nobles were gathered\ntogether, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Blessed are the merciful, for one\nshall have mercy on them,” and what followeth (Matthew 5).  And when the four stone\npillars, which formed the four corners of the tribune, heard his words, they said “Amen”;\nand the multitudes heard this voice.  And there was a certain man in whom a Satan had\nlived for seventy years, and the Satan cast him down at that moment, and went forth from\nhim, because of his hearing the voice from the pillars of stone.  And when the nobles heard\nthat voice they feared with a great fear, and they came to their dwelling places wondering\nin their minds.  And one of the nobles whose name was Caustus came to a woman whose\nname was ‘Akrosya, and told her what had happened, and how Peter had taught\nconcerning the forsaking of this world, and [on showing] mercy to the poor.  And when\nthis woman heard his voice, she woke up in her heart, and said, “This is a hard matter.” \nAnd then they promised each other that they would do everything, which Saint Peter\ntaught, and they distributed all their riches among the poor and destitute folk.  And after\nthose days the emperor sent to Caustus, and told him to come and consult with him\nconcerning an imperial matter.  And when Caustus heard this he was sorry, because he had\nno money to give to the emperor, and because he had no money for the necessary expenses\nof the journey.  And he took counsel with his wife, [saying,] “He maketh a pretence to me\nwith many words.”  And his wife said unto him, “Go, only the God of Saint Peter can\nmake [matters] good for thee”; and he came to the emperor who received him with great\njoy.  And after a year he returned to his house, and behold, his two sons were dead; and his\nwife was afraid to tell him the truth.   And she made a pretence to him, with much\nspeaking, but at length she told him, and on hearing it he sorrowed.  And she also said unto\nhim, “O my lord, let us pray to God,” and they prayed to God with a whole heart and there\ncame a voice which said, “O Caustus, O wife of Caustus, because ye have received the\nwords of Peter, My disciple, I will give you back your sons alive”; and straightway their\nsons rose from the dead, and all those who heard [of this] glorified God.  Now one of those\nwho rose was Clement, who became a disciple of this apostle.  And Saint Peter told him all\nthe mysteries which he had seen, and how he had seen our Lord Jesus Christ going up into\nheaven in the flesh, and he delivered to him the secret books which it is not meet that men\nshould see; and this Clement he made a bishop, and his brother he made a deacon.  And\nmoreover, Saint Peter saw a great and honorable similitude of the Lady of us all, Mary, the\nPure, the God-bearer.  He saw a cloud, which was like unto a bow, and in the cloud, which\nappeared upon it a tabernacle of light, and in the innermost part thereof sat, in the flesh,\n\nour holy Lady, the two-fold Virgin Mary, the mother of our Lord in the flesh.  And angels\nsurrounded her, having swords and spears of fire in their hands, and they said, “O blessed\nwoman, thou art the vineyard, the beautiful one wherefrom grew the grapes of salvation. \nBlessed art thou, O Upper Chamber, for thou didst carry in thy womb the Lamb of God,\nand the Lord of lords.  Rejoice, O Mother of light, Mother of mercy.  Rejoice, O Throne of\nsalvation, on whom sat the God of gods.  Rejoice, O Lady of all men.”  And when the\nangels had finished saluting her, our Lord Jesus Christ appeared, and spoke with her, and\nnone knew what He said unto her except Mary; and straightway there was an earthquake. \nAnd Peter also saw mysteries, which are ineffable.  And after this our Lord commanded\nPeter to preach in all the cities, and he preached the preaching of the Holy Gospel.  And he\nwent to the seacoast and came to the city of Emmaus, and Leda (Lydda).  And one day\nwhilst he was praying in the city of Iyope (Joppa) a cloud of light enveloped him, and\nthere came down a sheet, which was spread out, from heaven to earth, and there were in it\nall kinds of four-footed creatures, and all kinds of birds, and the similitude of swine.  And\na voice cried to him from heaven, saying, “Arise, Peter kill and eat.”  And he said unto\nHim, “O my Lord, I cannot kill and eat what is unclean.”  And again a voice called him,\nsaying, “What God hath cleansed let not man hold to be unclean”; and he heard this voice\nthree times.  And each time the voice called him, a finger made a sign to him and pointed\nto the beast, which was like unto a pig.  And that sheet went up and was withdrawn into\nheaven, and he marveled at what he had seen and he understood that [it signified] the\nreception of the Gentiles who were to turn to God, and he told the holy Apostles his\nbrethren this.  And then Saint Peter came with Saint John to the city of Antioch, as our\nLord Jesus Christ had commanded them; and Peter sent John on to the gates of the city, so\nthat he might learn the affairs of the city, and he asked concerning the report of Antioch. \nAnd he found outside the city certain evil men, who spoke words of insult to him and\nwanted to kill him.  And he returned weeping and angry, and said unto Saint Peter, “If\nthese common folk are as bad as this, what shall we do before the kings of this city, and\nthe nobles thereof?  Even if we come into it and preach in the Name of the Lord Jesus\nChrist, how shall we teach the Faith?”  And Peter said unto him, “O my beloved, be not\ndismayed by the words of these men, and be not sorrowful, for He Who hath brought us\nfrom Jerusalem hither in one night, that is to say a journey of twenty days on horses, will\nprosper our work.”  And after that they came into the city, and preached in the Name of\nour Lord Jesus Christ, and the men of the city and the priests of the idols gathered together\nand beat them severely, and treated them with ignominy, and made a mock of them, and\ncut off one half of the hair of their heads, and tied them up in a tower and shut the doors on\nthem; and they prayed to God to help them.   And our Lord Jesus Christ, Who was\nsurrounded with the Cherubim and the Seraphim, appeared unto them, and said unto them,\n“O Peter and John, fear ye not and be not sorrowful, for I will be with you to the end of the\nworld.  And marvel not because they have shaved the centre of your heads to make sport\nof you, for this shall be unto you a sign of which to boast, and for hair of honor.  And it\nshall be a sign of priesthood to every man who shall follow you in the Church, and who\nshall offer My Body, even as ye do now.  To the priest who dieth with this crown upon his\nhead I will give remission of sins”; and having said this to them He went up into heaven\nwith [great] glory.  Then by the commandment of God, Saint Paul arrived, and the saints\nmet and talked together.  And when he saw Saint John he said unto them, “What have the\nmen of this city done to thee?”  And Saint John said unto him, “Marvel not at me, for the\nchief of the Apostles also [hath] this symbol.”  And Saint Paul went to the city of Antioch,\nand held converse with the men as he wished, and he pretended that he would worship the\nidols; and he released the saints and took them away.  And he asked them about their work,\nand he told them that he also was a disciple of our Lord Christ.  And they worked miracles\nthere, and they opened the eyes of those who had been blind from their mother’s wombs. \nAnd they also made to live the king’s son who had been dead for three months, and whose\nbody had decayed and become corruption; and the king and his wife held converse with\nSaint Peter and believed.  And Saint Peter smote the ground and water flowed forth, and he\nbaptized the king and all the men of Antioch in the Name of Father and the Son and the\nHoly Spirit, and they built a church there.  And after this the believing men who were in\nLaodicea sent to him [a messenger to say] that the river Kisaros had drowned many men,\nand flooded their villages, and their flocks; and Peter and Paul sent him to Saint John, the\n\nbeloved.  And as the saint was going along the road, he found a sheep which had become\nseparated from its flock, and he sent it on, saying, “Go to the river Kisaros, and say unto it,\n‘The disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ hath sent me to thee, and he telleth thee to become\nfettered by the word of God.”  And the sheep went and did as the saint commanded it, and\nthe river became quiet (i.e. subsided).  And when the infidels saw this miracle a countless\nmultitude of them believed.  And then he passed on to the city of Rome, and he preached\ntherein and performed many signs and wonders, and he conquered Simon, the magician,\nwho had resisted him, and he cast him down from his rule over the souls of men.  And at\nthis miracle many men believed, and the concubines of ‘Akrepos, the legate of the city,\nbelieved through him, and preserved [their] purity, and many women withdrew from their\nhusbands.   And because of this the people took counsel to kill him, and the wife of\nAltabius, a friend of the king, sent a message to Saint Peter advising him to go forth from\nthe city of Rome, and the believing brethren likewise told him to do this, and he went forth\nfrom the city alone, and he disguised himself so that no one might know him.  And he\nfound our Lord coming into the city in the form in which he had first known Him, and he\nbowed low before Him, and said unto Him, “Whither goest thou, [my] Lord?”  And He\nsaid unto him, “To Rome, that I may be crucified.”  And Saint Peter said unto Him, “Lord,\nwilt Thou be crucified a second time?”  And Saint Peter remembered that He had said unto\nhim, “When thou art grown up, another shall gird thee and take thee whither thou wouldst\nnot go.”  And straightway he returned to the city, and told the brethren everything, which\nhad taken place between our Lord Christ [and himself], and they were very sad.  And when\nthe Emperor Nero heard the report of him, he seized him and commanded the soldiers to\ncrucify him.   And Peter begged and entreated that they would crucify him head\ndownwards, saying, “My Lord Jesus Christ was crucified standing upright, and it is meet\nfor me to be crucified head downwards.”  And when they crucified him he spoke unto the\nbelievers the word of life, and he strengthened them in the True Faith, and after this he\ndelivered up his soul into the hand of God.  Salutation to thee, O Peter.\nAnd on this day also became a martyr Saint Paul, the tongue of oil, the tongue of Christ,\nthe tongue of sweet perfume, the lamp of Christians, the fountain of life, and the well of\nwisdom, whose name being interpreted is “leader, commander, he who is praised,” or\naccording to another interpretation, “haven, tranquility, quietness and keeping silent.” \nThis Saint Paul was a Jew, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; and\nhis kinsfolk called his name “Saul,” the well-known interpretation of which is, “given.” \nHe was a young man of handsome appearance, upright in stature, and ruddy, like the rind\nof a pomegranate.  His face was open, his nose was large, above his eyes was kohl, his\ncheeks were [like] an open rose, and his beard was full.  He was learned in the Law of the\nTorah, and he was jealous for the same.  And the disciples, who believed through the holy\nApostles, were exceedingly afraid of him, because he had received authority from the high\npriest, who wrote to him an order, with his own hand, commanding him to bind with\nfetters all those who preached in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And as Saul and\nthose who were with him were journeying along the road from the city of Jerusalem to the\ncity of Damascus, a light from heaven shone upon him, and he fell upon his face on the\nground, and he heard a voice which said unto him, “Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute\nMe?  It is bad for thee to kick against sharp goads.”  And he said unto Him, “Who art thou,\nLord?”  And He answered and said unto him, “I am that Jesus, the Nazarene, Whom thou\npersecutest.  But rise up, and come into the city of Damascus, and there they will tell thee\nwhat thou must do.”  And the men of Jerusalem who were with him stood up, and they\nheard His voice but there was none whom they saw.  And Saul rose up from the earth, and\nthough his eyes were open he saw nothing, and leading him they brought him to\nDamascus, where he remained for three days, not eating, not drinking, and not seeing. \nAnd there was a certain man in the city of Damascus, who was one of the holy apostles\nand whose name was Hananya (Ananias), and our Lord appeared unto him and said unto\nhim, “Hananya (Ananias),” and he said, “Behold me, my Lord.”  And the Lord said unto\nhim, “Rise up, and go to the street which is called ‘Straight’ and enquire there in the house\nof Sayda [for a man] whose name is Saul, of the city of Tarsus.”  And Hananya (Ananias)\nsaid unto Him, “My Lord, I have heard about that man and of all the evil which he hath\ndone to the saints of Jerusalem, and having obtained authority from the high-priest, he hath\n\ncome hither to imprison all those who bear Thy Name.”  And our Lord said unto him, “I\nhave set him to be a chosen vessel for Me, and he shall go and carry My Name among the\npeoples and kings of Israel.  And I will show him how great things he must suffer for My\nName.”   And Saint Hananya (Ananias) went and came to his house, and found him\npraying, and he laid his hand upon him, and he prayed over him that he might see.  And he\nsaid unto him, “Saul, my brother, my Lord Jesus Christ, Who appeared unto thee on the\nroad as thou camest hither, hath sent me unto thee that thou mayest see, and be filled with\nthe Holy Spirit.”  And straightway there went out of Paul’s eyes as it were scales, and he\ncould see, and he rose up, and was baptized, and ate food, and became strong; and he\nremained in Damascus a few days with the holy apostles, and preached in their\nSynagogues.  And he taught concerning our Lord Jesus Christ, saying, “He is the Son of\nGod,” and all those who heard him marveled, saying, “Is not this the man who killed those\nwho were called by this name in Jerusalem and here also?”  And this Saint Paul the apostle\nwas filled with the grace of the Holy Spirit Paraclete, and he proclaimed boldly the Faith\nof righteousness.  And his jealously for the Law of our Lord Jesus Christ was double that\nwhich he had had for the Law of the Torah.  And he went unto all the ends of the world,\nand preached the Name of our Lord Who was crucified, and a multitude of people who\ncould not be numbered believed through him.  And great tribulation came [upon him], and\nmany beatings.  And the Jews shut him up in prison, and bound him with fetters, and sunk\nhim in the sea, and took him into deserts, and tortured him with every king of torture.  And\nbehold, it is written in his Epistles, and in the Book of the Acts of the Apostles, saying,\n“The Holy Spirit separated Saul and Barnabas for the work which He required of them”\nAnd for this reason they went into the land of the Greeks and performed many miracles,\nsome of them took place when they went round the island of Kuela.   And they came to a\ncity, the name of which is Yafus (Paphos), and they found a certain Jewish magician whose\nname was Elymas, who withstood them, and wished to keep the deputy of the city from\nthem and from the Faith.  And Saint Paul rebuked him and said unto him, “Behold, the\nhand of God is upon thee.  Thou shalt become blind, and shalt not see the sun until the\ntime when the appointed time shall have come”; and straightway the eyes of Elymas\nclouded over, and became sightless, and he enquired for some one to lead him.  And when\nthe governor of the city saw him, he marveled and believed in God.  And then they went to\nthe district of Lukanya (Lycania) and Lestran (Lystra), and Darben (Derbe), and taught\nthere.  And there was in the city of Lestran (Lystra) a certain man with twisted feet, and he\nwas born thus from his mother’s womb, and he had never walked; and he heard Saint Paul\nspeaking.  And Saint Paul knew that the man had in him the faith whereby he would be\nhealed, and he said unto him, “In the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ rise up and stand\nupon thy feet”; and straightway he rose up and walked, and when the people saw him they\nbelieved.   And whilst he was there, certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium came and\nstoned the blessed Saint Paul, and they dragged him outside the city, for they thought that\nhe was dead.   And on the following day, when Saint Barnabas was near the city, he\nappointed a priest to each of the churches there.  And then he went to Phrygia and Galatia\nand on towards Tiro’ada (Troad), and they passed over into Macedonia.  And they found\nthere a girl who was under the power of a demon, and she brought to her owners her\nearnings, which were much, and she followed after them crying out and saying, “These\nservants of God shall teach us the way of life”; and she pressed upon Saint Paul.  And\nSaint Paul turned, and rebuked the unclean spirit, which was on her, in the Name of our\nLord Jesus Christ, and the girl was healed.  And after this he went out to the city of Halab,\nand he made to live the mother of Timothy, whose name was Badreman, who had been\ndead.  There the people wished him to sacrifice to the god of the city, [but he refused to do\nso].  And they cast him into a furnace, and he stretched out his arms in the form of the\nCross, and the men of the city saw the sign of the Cross with their own eyes; and they\nentreated him to come out, and he went forth, being injured in no wise, and they prostrated\nthemselves before him.  And all the people believed through them, and even Anestus, the\ngovernor of the city, believed; and the priests of the seventy idols fled and hid themselves. \nAnd Saint Paul called the figure of gold, which was in the form of a guza, and it came and\nstood up in the form of a lion in the middle of the temple.  And Saint Paul said unto it,\n“Where are the priests who worship thee?”  And the lion answered and said unto him,\n“Wait, O my lord, until I am able to tell thee where they are.”  And the lion went to where\n\nthey were hidden, and brought out one of the priests, holding him by is neck, which was in\nhis mouth, and he dragged him along like a dead man, and cast him down among the\npeople; and thus he did to the seventy of them.   And when the people saw [this] they\nwanted to kill the priests.  And Saint Paul said, “This day life and not death is seemly in\nthis city,” and he baptized them all.  And he said unto the image of the guza, which was a\nlion, “Fear not, O lion, because thou hast ministered unto me, thy existence shall be in the\ndesert until I want thee”; and he dwelt in the desert of the lion.  And Saint Paul went ... and\ncame into the city.  And the Jews heard of the report of him, and they gathered together\nagainst him, and seized him, and tortured him.  And they also brought two oxen, and they\nlifted up the feet of Saint Paul, and tied him between two oxen, with ‘Antekos his disciple,\nand they dragged them through the streets of the city, over the sharp stones, until their\nblood flowed like water, and their bodies were torn and cut, and their bones were visible.  \nAnd the disciples prayed to God, and the two oxen, and the man who was driving them,\nturned into stone in the midst of the city, where they stood still, and they are there until this\nday.   And the people having seen this told the governor, and he became wroth, and\ncommanded the soldiers to bring them before him, and they brought them, [the people]\nstoning them as they did so.  And the governor was wroth with Saint Paul, and he said unto\nhim, “O man, behold, I will torture thee.”  And he commanded them to bring two brass\nbulls, and they brought bitumen, and pitch, and sulfur, and fat and mixed them together,\nand they smeared the outside and the inside of the two brass bulls therewith, and they cast\nthe disciples into them.  Then they took them into a furnace, and they lighted a fire therein,\nand kept it burning for three days and three nights.  And our Lord Jesus Christ came, with\nHis angels, and He made the furnace to move from its place into the grounds of the offices\nof the government, and the flames blew backwards, and consumed the men of the city. \nAnd a voice from heaven called those who remained, and bade them to gather together to\nthe furnace (?).  And the lion, which Paul had sent into the desert, came and cried out with\n[his] voice, saying, “Believe ye in the Lord Jesus Christ, [the God] of Saint Paul.”  And the\nlion came back, and said unto Saint Paul and Sekantes, “Get forth from the fire, so that the\nmen of this city may not know”; and they went forth from the red-hot furnace alive, and\nthe hair of their heads was not singed, and there was no smell of fire upon them.  And\nstraightway all the people cried out, saying, “We believe in our Lord Jesus Christ, the\nNazarene,” and Paul baptized them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the\nHoly Ghost.  And he made Sekantes a priest, and having built there a church, he departed\nto the city of Athens.   Then he went to other cities with Saint Philip the apostle and\npreached therein, and the elders of the city seized them, and bound them hand and foot,\nand put chains about their necks, and they made iron helmets to put over their heads.  And\nthey also made figures of the hand, with palms and fingers of iron, and they thrust them\nover their hands and along their arms, until each hand and arm was covered with iron, and\nthen they drove nails through them.  And they also made figures of the shoulders in iron,\nwhich reached up to the neck and they drove nails into them, back and front; and they\nmade plates of iron to envelop their limbs and to cover their bodies in such a way that no\npart of the body was visible.  And they nailed plates of iron over their sides, and they made\nshoes of iron for their feet, and they drove nails through their hands, and the soles of their\nfeet, and their thighs; and they made plates (?) in the form of a covering.  And men who\nprepared roots and drugs came, and brought a talent of lead, and huge vessel of brass, and\nseven pound of refined fat.  And they mixed with it grease, and wax, and ox-fat, and many\nroots for burning in the fire, and bitumen, and pitch, and sulfur, and tar, and seven pounds\nof colophony resin, and glue (?), and clematis wood (i.e. brushwood), and charcoal, and\nvery much wood.  And they brought bitumen, which had been prepared, and melted it in\nthe [brass] vessel, and they daubed it on the iron plates, inside which were on the bodies of\nthe saints, until they took the shape of their bodies.  And they poured over the iron plates,\ninside which were the saints, the lead which they had melted, until it reached from their\nfeet to their heads.  And they set them up by the side of a bushy pine tree, which was five\ncubits high from the ground to the top thereof, and they lighted a fire about the apostles\nwith the leaves and branches of vines from which the fruit had been plucked, and the\nflames rose up over their bodies.  And the apostles prayed to God, and He put mercy into\nthe heart of one of the nobles, who said unto the soldiers. “Release them.”  And when they\nhad released them, they removed the plates of iron form their bodies and their skin peeled\n\noff, and came away like flakes of iron, and the blood of the apostles dripped down upon\nthe ground.  And Satan entered into the hearts of the men of the city, and they put the\napostles back again into the fire, but an angel came down, and extinguished the fire on\nthem, and a bright cloud came and rained on them and enshrouded the bodies of the\nsaints.  And when the people of this city saw this, they all believed.  Now the saints were\ntortured by stoning and by being shot at with arrows.  [And the apostles] raised many from\nthe dead.  And after this Saint Paul departed to another city, and preached the preaching of\nthe Holy Gospel.  And our Lord Jesus Christ appeared unto him, and said unto him, “Peace\nbe unto thee, O Paul, My chosen one.  Whosoever shall celebrate thy commemoration, and\ncall upon thy name, and build a church in thy name, and shall visit the church and pray\ntherein, and make votive offerings to it, and shall perform mercy on the day of thy\ncommemoration in any way whatsoever, all these I will establish with thee in the kingdom\nof My Father, which is in the heavens.  And whosoever shall build churches in thy name, I\nwill see that My angels have them under their protection.”  And He promised him many\nthings, and gave him a salute with His holy mouth, and went up into heaven.  And then\nthey journeyed about to many cities.  And he came into the great city of Tarikon, and he\nsaw our Lady Mary, the mother of light, and she commanded him to teach in that city; and\nshe told him many things, and she gave him “Peace,” and went up into heaven.  And then\nSaint Paul came into the city of Rome, and preached therein, and many of the men thereof\nbelieved through him, and he baptized them with holy Christian baptism; and he wrote to\nthem twelve Epistles, and that [to the Romans] is the first of his Epistles.  And after this\nthe Emperor Nero seized him and tortured him severely, and delivered him up that the\nsoldiers might cut off his head.   And as he was passing along with the executioner, a\ncertain maiden who was a kinswoman of the Emperor Nero, and who had believed through\nhim on our Lord Jesus Christ, met him, and when she saw him with the executioner she\nwept.  And he comforted her, and said unto her, “Give me thy cloak, and I will return [it]\nto thee soon”; and she gave him her cloak.  And Saint Paul went with the executioner to\nthe place where they cut off heads, and having bowed his head to the executioner, he\ncovered his face with the cloak of the maiden, and the executioner cut off the holy head of\nSaint Paul and left it wrapped in the cloak of the maiden.  And the maiden said [to the\nexecutioner], “Where is Paul?”  And he said, “Behold, he is lying in the place where they\ncut off heads, and his head is covered up in thy cloak.”  And she answered and said unto\nhim, “Thou liest.  Behold the saints Peter and Paul have this moment left me, and they\nwere arrayed in the apparel of kings, and they had decorated crowns on their heads, and\nthey gave me my cloak.  And behold, this is it as thou canst see”; and she showed it to the\nexecutioner, and to those who were with him, and they marveled thereat and believed on\nour Lord Jesus Christ.   And God wrought by the hands of Paul the apostle signs and\nwonders which cannot be counted; and the people used to lay the sick folk in their beds by\nthe road on which Saint Paul passed, and when his shadow fell upon them they recovered\nfrom their sicknesses immediately.  Salutation to Paul.  Salutation to Peter and Paul.\nSalutation to Caustus and to ‘Akrosia.  [Wanting in the Bodleian MS.]\nSalutation to Agrippa, and to Anestia, and to Deweres, and to Karia, and to ‘Akrama, and\nto ‘Akrabania, and to ‘Akestiana, and to the wife of Altabius of Rome.  [Wanting in the\nBodleian MS.]\nAnd on this day also are commemorated the Seventy-two martyrs (i.e. Disciples), and\nIsaac who lived in the city of Gaza, and the righteous men who were in Debre Ash.\nSalutation to the Seventy-two Disciples. \nSalutation to Isaac.\nSalutation to the Fathers of Debre Ash.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated the festival of Sakue’el, the Archangel.  Salutation\nto Sakue’el.\n\nSalutation to the sainted woman Maskal Kibra.\nSalutation to Marcellus, the son of Yona, the disciple of Paul.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and wisdom sprung\nup and knowledge flowed forth [like a spring].   And he did this for four years of the\nSabbaths of the years.  And after the judgment (or, punishment), in the five thousand and\ntwelfth year of the darkness, in the third month, on the ninth day of the month, on that day\nthey took Ezra Beher and all those scribes who were with him.  Salutation to thee Sutuel,\nthe remaining [one] of the Prophets.\nAnd on this day also died the holy woman Saturnina.  This saint was of the people of\nJerusalem, and aforetime she was a sinner.  And then she repented and turned to God, with\nburning of heart and bitter weeping; and she rejected the lust of the flesh and at length\nbecame an abbess.  And she excelled in performing works of ascetic virtue, and when one\nlooked at her behold one saw that her body had dwindled away through her excessive\nspiritual fighting, and through her renunciation of food.  And the nuns said unto her, “Eat a\nsmall amount of lentils that thou mayest help thy body,” and when they set them before\nher she said unto them, “O my daughters, I will not trouble myself for the sake of a few\n\nlentils, for I should return to penitence for my former sins, and because of this I should\nincrease greatly my eating.”  And then she died in peace.  Salutation to Saturnina.\nAnd on this day also the holy Apostle ‘Alempeyas (Olympius), who was called Paul,\nbecame a martyr.   This saint was of the number of the Seventy-Two disciples, and he\nfollowed the Apostles and went with them to the preaching.  And he carried the Epistles of\nthe Apostle Peter, and ministered unto him at the time of his tribulation, and he suffered\nwith him, and came with him into the city of Rome.  And he preached the preaching of the\nHoly Gospel, and he taught and converted many of the pagans to the Faith of our Lord\nJesus Christ.  And when Saint Peter the apostle became a martyr, this apostle came and\ntook him down from the honorable Cross, and he wrapped him in fine and costly cloths\nand laid him in the house of one of the believers.  And certain men informed the Emperor\nNero that he was a disciple of Saint Peter, and the emperor had him brought, and he\nquestioned him about it, and the saint confessed that he was a disciple of Saint Peter the\napostle, and he confessed that our Lord Jesus Christ was God indeed.  And Nero tortured\nhim severely, and beat him, and crucified him, and he burned the lower part of him as he\nwas hanging.  And after this the emperor said unto him, “How dost thou wish to die?” so\nthat I may kill thee.  And the saint answered and said unto him, “I wish to die for the Name\nof my Lord Jesus Christ, kill me any way thou wishest, and bring me speedily to my\ndesire.”   And Nero commanded the soldiers to beat him and to crucify him, head\ndownwards, like his master Saint Peter;

Now his father had flocks of sheep, and when\nSinoda was grown up, he handed them over to his son to tend; and Saint Sinoda used to\ngive the shepherds their food.   And he would go down to the well in the cold winter\nseason, and stand up in it, and pray from evening until dawn, all the time.  And a certain\nrighteous old man testified concerning him, saying, that he saw the fingers of Saint Sinoda\nlike ten lighted lamps.  And his father took him, and carried him to Saint Abba ‘Absal his\nmother’s brother, that he might bless him.  And Abba ‘Absal laid [his hands] on the boy’s\nhead, and said unto him, “My blessing, O Sinoda, for assuredly thou shalt become the\ngreat father of many peoples”; and his father left him with Abba ‘Absal.  And one day\nAbba ‘Absal heard a voice from heaven, saying, “Behold, appoint Saint Sinoda\n‘Arsimatradas over all the world.”   And he fought a great spiritual fight, and devoted\nhimself to the works of piety, with fasting and prayer, and prostrations, and frequent and\nceaseless vigils; and he became the light of all the ends of the world.  And he composed\nmany Homilies, and Admonitions, and profitable Sayings.  One night the angel of God\nappeared to Abba ‘Absal, and brought him the apparel of Elijah the prophet, and the head\ncloths of the Three Children, and the girdle of Saint John the Baptist, and he said unto him,\n“God saith unto thee:  Pray over Sinoda, and array him in this apparel of the ascetic life.” \nAnd straightway Abba ‘Absal rose up, and prayed over Abba Sinoda, and arrayed him in\nthe garb of the ascetic life.  And after this he fought a great fight, and he drew up a Canon\nfor monks, and nuns, and the laity, and women, and all [classes of] men.  And when the\nGeneral Council of two hundred Bishops assembled in the city of Ephesus, he went with\nfather Abba Cyril, the Archbishop to the Council; and he overcame the infidel Nestorius\nand anathematized him and excommunicated him.  And when they were coming back the\nsailors would not allow Abba Sinoda to travel in the ship with the Archbishop, and\nstraightway he prayed and entreated God, and a cloud took him up.   And as he was\ntraveling on the cloud he looked down from above on Saint Abba Cyril, who was in the\nship, and he saluted him, saying, “Peace be unto thee, O my Father, and unto those who\nare with thee”; and [Cyril] said unto him, “And on thee also, and on those who are with\nthee [be peace]; forget me [not] in thy prayer.”  And they marveled at him exceedingly,\nand they glorified God Who giveth such grace unto those who fear Him.  And he came to\nhis monastery, and joined in the midnight prayer with his sons the monks.  And out Lord\n\nJesus Christ was wont to visit him often, and to converse with him, and he washed the feet\nof our Lord revealed unto him many mysteries, and he prophesied prophecies.  And after\nthis he grew old in his days and he lay down [sick] on the seventh day of the month\nHamle.  And our Lord Jesus Christ came and sat by him and comforted him, and Abba\nSinoda said unto Him, “O my Lord and God, make Thou me as strong as I was formerly,\nso that I may go to the Council, for the Archbishop hath sent [saying] that they summon\nme because of the infidels, who blaspheme against the Holy Trinity and would take from\nThee Thy Godhead.”  And our Lord and God and Redeemer with great grace, and with a\nsweet voice, answered and said unto him, “O My chosen one Sinoda, dost thou wish for\nmore days?  Behold, thy days are one hundred and twenty years and two months!  Thou\ndidst put on the garb of the ascetic life when thy days were nine years, and from the time\nwhen thou didst put on the garb of the ascetic life until today is one hundred and eleven\nyears and two months.  The toil is sufficient for thee.”  And when our Lord had said this\nHe went up into heaven in great glory.  And when it was the seventh day of the month\nHamle, the Company of the Saints came to him, and he saw our Lord Jesus Christ.  And he\nsaid unto his sons, “Hold me, so that I may worship my Lord Jesus Christ”; and they lifted\nhim up and he worshipped Him.  And then he said unto his sons, “I commit you to God. \nBehold, the Will of God hath reached me that my soul must be separated from my\nexhausted body, and I command you to submit yourselves to your father Wida, for he shall\nbe your shepherd after me.”  And having said this our Lord Jesus Christ said unto him,\n“Blessed art thou, O My chosen one Sinoda, and excellence shall be unto thee for My\nsake, because thou hast performed My good pleasure all the days of thy life.  And now,\ncome with Me so that I may make thee to rest in the joy which is for ever.”  And when He\nhad said this unto him, Sinoda delivered up his soul into the hand of God, and he died in\npeace.  Salutation to Abba Sinoda, to whom was given the apparel of Elijah the prophet.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Makabis (Maccabaeus), who fought the\nfight in the desert of Hur and pleased God.\nAnd on this day also became a martyr Saint Abba Ignatius, Archbishop of the city of\nRome; he succeeded Peter in the days of the Emperor Tarabeyanos.  When the emperor\nheard that this father was teaching all the people, and bringing them into the Faith of our\nLord Jesus Christ, and that they were renouncing the worship of idols, he had Ignatius\nbrought before him and he said unto him, “Sacrifice to the gods.”  And [though] he would\nneither obey him, now submit to him, he promised him many things, and was not angry\nwith him; but Ignatius would not accept his promised gifts, and he was not afraid of his\nwrath.   And when there had been much speech between them, and Ignatius would not\nagree with the emperor in his infidelity, straightway the emperor gave him to the lions. \nAnd Saint Ignatius gave commands to the people, and made them strong in the True Faith. \nAnd one of the lions drew nigh to him, and seized him by the head, and the saint delivered\nup his soul into the hand of God; and after this the lion did not come near him at all.  And\nthey carried away his body in great honor, and laid it in the good place, which God had\nprepared for it.  Salutation to Ignatius who inherited the throne of Peter.\nSalutation to him that became a pilgrim.\nSalutation to George the priest, whom the Virgin taught to pray.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and when this saint was born he\ncalled him John.  And he built first of all a church in the name of Saint John the Baptist. \nAnd when the boy was grown up and his days were twelve years, his father gave him his\nflock to tend.  And John used to give his food to the shepherds every day, and also to those\nwho passed by on the road, and he fasted until the evening daily.  And when his father\nheard this he went to him in the fields so that he might know if what people had told him\nabout him [was true], and the young man Saint John was afraid lest his father should beat\nhim, and he wanted to flee.  And his father said unto him, “Show me thy food [for] this\nday”; and John answered and said unto him, “Go inside that thou mayest see it.”  And\nwhen his father went inside, and [looked at] the place where things were put, he saw that it\nwas full of hot bread, and he marveled exceedingly and told his mother what had happened\nto their son.  And from that hour they knew that grace was on their son, and they no longer\nallowed him to tend the sheep.  And the saint studied and learned by heart many of the\nBooks of the Church.  And his parents asked him to let them arrange a marriage for him,\nbut he did not wish this.  And when his days were eighteen years, he was made a priest,\nand Simon, the son of his father’s brother, left the sheep and became his disciple, and he it\nwas who described his miracles.  Now God made manifest through him great miracles, and\nthe people used to bring unto him those who were sick with every sickness whatsoever,\nand he prayed over some olive oil, and anointed them therewith, and they were healed of\ntheir sickness.  And he rebuked the sick, and said unto them, “Many ills come upon you\nbecause of your sins”; and this saint wrought so many miracles that they cannot be\ncounted, and among them are the following:  A soldier took and carried off some barley\nfrom a widow woman.  And the widow came to the saint, and complained to him about the\nsoldier, and the saint cursed him, and his horse died when he had eaten the barley.  On one\noccasion the king’s general came to collect tribute, and he had with him a man, one of\nwhose eyes was blind.  And that man came to Saint John, and was blessed by him, and\nstraightway his eye that was blind was opened, and he saw well with it.  And this holy man\ncould see by the Holy Spirit the deeds of all men, and their sins were revealed to him, and\nhe rebuked them for their sins.  And the report of this saint was heard of by a king whose\nname was Marianus, who had an only daughter, and a serpent entered her belly, and grew\nup therein, and she was nigh to die; and although her father had given much money to the\nphysicians they were unable to cure her.  And the general made known to him the history\nof Saint John, and how he had opened the eye of his blind servant, and the king\ncommanded his soldiers to send and bring the saint.  And Saint John knew by the Spirit\nthat the king wanted to bring him to him, and he feared the fatigue of the journey and the\nsea.  And straightway a cloud caught him up from the city of Sarmalas, and carried him\nalong until it brought him to the city of Antioch, and set him upon the king’s bed; and\nwhen the king saw him he was troubled and was afraid.   And the saint told the king,\nsaying, “I am that poor man for whom thou didst wish to send and bring hither.”  [And the\nking brought] his daughter to Saint John, and he prayed over her, and the serpent went\nforth from her belly without injuring her, or causing her pain.  And the king and all the\nmen of the house of the king were blessed by him, and they marveled exceedingly, and\nthey glorified God Who gave such grace to those who love Him and who do His\ncommands.  And the king offered him much money and gifts, but he would take nothing\nwhatsoever from him.  And the king wished to make him dwell with him, but could not\nmake him do so, and he laid hold upon his girdle so that he might [not] depart, and a cloud\ncaught him up whilst the king was holding his girdle in his hand, and the girdle broke in\n\nthe king’s hand, and Saint John arrived in his city that night.  And the king built a church\nover that girdle, and it is called “the church of the girdle” to this day.  When Saint John\nconsecrated the Offering he could distinguish between the sinners and the good, and those\nwho were fit to partake and those who were not.   When Diocletian denied Christ, and\nworshipped idols, this saint took Simon, the son of his father’s brother, and went to the\ncity of Alexandria, and confessed our Lord Jesus Christ before the governor.   And the\nsoldiers tortured them severely, and after this they cut off their heads with their swords. \nAnd their souls entered into everlasting rest, and their bodies are to this day in the city of\nGamnudi, where great miracles and healings take place through them.  Salutation to John\nand to Simon.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated the great saint Abba Isaiah the anchorite, of the\ndesert of Scete.  Salutation to Isaiah.\nAnd on this day also died Saint Abba Gabriel, the seventy-eighth (sic) Archbishop of the\ncity of Alexandria.  This saint had believing and blessed parents, and they walked in the\nway of God, and in His commandments, and according to His good pleasure.  And having\nbegotten him, they reared him in the fear of God.  One day there came to him certain holy\nmonks, and among them was a righteous elder whose spiritual fight was good.  And he\nsaw a beautiful vision, as it were many bishops surrounding the boy, and they laid their\nhands upon him, and blessed him, and they all said, “So be it, so be it.”  When the elder\nwoke up from his vision he meditated and said, “The boy shall become great.”  And he\nsaid unto his father, “Teach him well, for assuredly he shall become the head and chief of\nmany peoples; thou wilt not see him at all times.”  And he told him what he had seen; and\nthe father of the boy praised God, saying, “Shall anything happen to this boy?”  And when\nhis days were two (?) years his father died in the mercy of our Lord and God and\nRedeemer Jesus Christ.  Now the boy had an uncle whose name was Peter, and he was\nBishop of the city of Behna, and his spiritual fight was admirable, and he was learned in\nall the holy Books of God of the New and of the Old Testaments, and he took the boy and\ntaught him.  And all those who saw the boy marveled at the grace of God, which was upon\nhim, and at his understanding and knowledge, and he was made a deacon.  And when his\ndays were twelve years he wanted to put on the garb of the ascetic life, and he renounced\nthis fleeting world.  And the Bishop Abba Peter gave him into the hands of the blessed\nmonk Abba Peter the priest, and he became devoted to God, and a fighter, and a man of\ngood piety.  And he took the boy and taught him the spiritual fight, and the Rule of the\nmonastic life in a few days, and signs and wonders and spiritual excellence appeared\nthrough him; and many men loved him because of his spiritual fight, and his devotion to\nGod, and his humility.  And after the death of his teacher, Peter the priest, he departed to\nthe monastery of Saint Anthony, where he lived for many years, fighting the fight with\nfasting, and prayer, and vigils and unceasing prostrations; and after this he departed to the\ndesert of Scete, to the monastery of Abba Macarius.  And he became abbot of the church\nof our holy Lady, the two-fold Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, in the monastery of Marmos,\nand he toiled and restored the building thereof.  And then he went to Jerusalem, and was\nblessed in the holy places, and there he was made priest of the church of the Holy\nResurrection by the hand of the holy father Bishop Abba Michael.  Thence he returned to\nthe city of Mesr (Cairo), and dwelt in the church of Mu’Allakah of our holy Lady the\nVirgin Mary, copying the holy Books of the Holy Church.  In those days the throne of\nMark the evangelist remained without an archbishop for a few days, and all the bishops\nand priests agreed with one consent to make this saint archbishop.  And Satan, the hater of\nwhat is good, brought certain men who were envious of him, and they did not wish him to\nbe appointed, and they appointed archbishop the holy and spiritual father Abba Athanasius,\nwho is know as “Son of the Crown.”  And good works appeared from him, and he walked\nuprightly without blemish, like Abba Athanasius the apostle, and then he died.  And again\nthe bishops, and the elders, and the people gathered together, and they set their hands to a\ndocument and wished that Abba Gabriel should be appointed archbishop.  And again the\nEnemy of what is good stirred up dissension among the people, and they agreed that the\nname of Gabriel and the names of others should be written on papers, and that they should\nbe laid on the altar, and that they should pray over them for three days, and should\ncelebrate the Offering, so that God should make known who was to hold this honorable\n\nposition and reveal his name.   And they did thus, and they brought a little child, who\nbrought forth the paper whereon was the name of this father; and all the bishops assembled\nand made him prefect of the church of Mu’Allakah.  And again his appointment was not\ncompleted, and Abba John, who is known as the “son of ‘Absadi,” was appointed.  And at\nthat time the church of Egypt suffered great tribulation.  When Abba John was appointed,\nthis father Abba Gabriel went to the monastery of Saint Abba Anthony, and he fought a\ngreat fight, and devoted himself to fasting, and prayer, and vigils, and to prostrations by\nday and by night; and in the strenuousness of his fight he was superior to many.  And he\nlived thus one year (?).  And many of the holy monks saw beautiful visions concerning\nhim, and some of them said that they saw him in the city of Alexandria, dressed in\narchiepiscopal apparel, with many Christians and Gentiles surrounding him.  And some of\nthem saw him in the desert of Scete, where he was appointed head of the monastery of\nSaint Abba Macarius; and some of them saw a countless number of keys handed to him. \nMany times when he wished to come down from the monastery of Abba Macarius, he\nbecame sick, and was unable to come down.  And then Saint Anthony appeared unto him,\nin a vision, and said unto him, “I do not wish thee to go down from the monastery except\nby the Will of God, and henceforward thou shalt not go down except at His time.”  And\nwhen three years were ended, a certain holy elder of the monks of the monastery of\nAnthony saw the vision of a glorious angel, who said unto him, “Three years from this\ntime they shall take Abba Gabriel and make him Archbishop of the city of Alexandria”;\nand that elder went out straightway and told Abba Gabriel what he had seen.  One day the\ngovernor of the city of Tafih came to the monastery of Abba Anthony, and with him were\nthe abbot, and many judges (or, officers), and a letter from the emperor ordering them to\nbring Abba Gabriel quickly, and to make him Archbishop of the city of Alexandria.  And\nthey took him against his will, and carried him with great honor to the city of Alexandria,\nand with him were the father bishops; and all the people rejoiced in him.  And that day he\nand the bishops, and the priests and the deacons, appointed a bishop to Jerusalem, and\nafter this he consecrated Myron (i.e. the holy oil) three times; and he remained thus for one\nyear and on month.  At that time Abba Anthony appeared, and said unto him, “Behold, thy\ndeparture draweth nigh, and after one year and a half thou shalt depart to God and shalt\ninherit everlasting life.”  And at that time great tribulation came upon the Christians, and\nthis father asked God to deliver them from it; and God accepted his petition and delivered\nthem.  Then the archbishop returned to his throne, and Abba Gabriel hid himself in a secret\nplace, and no man knew where he was, except a certain believer.   And through the\nexcessive intensity of his spiritual fight, by night and by day, his appearance became\nchanged, and his body dried up.  And after this God revealed the matter of this father to a\ncertain believer, who pleased God by his works, and he became zealous for him with a\ndivine zeal, and he brought him out of that place, and established him in the church of the\nApostles, and he lived there for many days devoting himself to prayer and to sacred\nduties.   And he visited the sick, and provided them with what they needed, and he\ncomforted the believers who came to him.  One night Abba Athanasius, the archbishop,\nappeared unto him plainly, and said unto him, “Be not sad because of the labor and sorrow\nwhich hath come to thee, for God hath delivered thee from much toil and tribulation.  And\nbehold, there must come upon thee a sickness, so that God may perfect thy patient\nendurance; rejoice, however, for thou hast received the grace of God, which is great, and\nthou shalt receive everlasting life, and joy which is unending.”  And straightway a severe\nsickness seized him, and he continued to be sick, and he was frightened and disturbed\nabout the departure of his soul from his body, and about his standing before God.  And\nthere was before his face a picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and to this he prayed\ncontinually; and at that time God Most High appeared unto him with a shining face, and\ncomforted him, and strengthened him, and said unto him, “Fear not, but rejoice, for thou\nhast received the grace of the kingdom of the heavens.  At the end of three days thou shalt\ndepart from this fleeting world”; and after three days he died in peace, and was buried in\nthe church of Saint Mercurius with great honor.  Salutation to Gabriel the Archbishop.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and the name of his\nmother was Theodosia, and she was a worshipper of idols.   When his father died his\nmother took him, and carrying with her much money and gifts, she departed to the city of\nAntioch; and she gave the money to Diocletian, and presented her son, this saint, to him,\nand asked him to make him a governor; and Diocletian took the money, and made her son\ngovernor of the city of Alexandria.  And then he commanded him to torture the Christians,\nand he wrote an order to do so, and placed it in his hand.  And when the saint had gone a\nlittle way from the city of Antioch, there came to him a terrifying voice from heaven,\ncalling him by his name, and saying unto him, “If thou doest as Diocletian commanded\nthee, thou thyself shalt die an evil death, if thou darest to transgress the command which I\nhave given thee.”   And ‘Abrokonyos said unto Him, “Who art Thou, O my Lord?   I\nbeseech Thee to show me Thyself.”  And straightway there appeared unto him a cross of\nlight, and he heard a voice, which said unto him, “I am Jesus Christ, the Son of the Living\nGod, Who was crucified in Jerusalem.”  And when he heard this voice he was afraid, and\ntrembled exceedingly, and he turned aside to the city of Bisan; and having made a cross of\ngold, they went to the city of Alexandria.  And as they were going along, the pagan Balaw\nand his men rose up against him, and wanted to kill him, but he resisted them strongly by\nthe might of the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, and conquered them.  And his mother said\nunto him, “O my son, offer up sacrifice to the gods who helped thee in the fight, and\ndelivered thee.”  And the saint answered and said unto her, “I will sacrifice only to my\nLord Jesus Christ, Who helped me by the life-giving Cross.”  And when his mother heard\nthese words she sent and informed the Emperor Diocletian that her son ‘Abrokonyos had\nbecome a Christian.  And Diocletian sent to the governor of Caesarea, and ordered him to\nenquire concerning ‘Abrokonyos and to torture him.  And when the governor had this saint\nbrought before him, and ‘Abrokonyos confessed our Lord Jesus Christ before him, he beat\nhim so severely that he well nigh died, and then he cast him into prison.  And after this our\nLord Jesus Christ appeared unto him that night with great light, and with Him were\nshining angels, and He embraced the saint and released him from his bonds, and He\ntouched his body with His divine hand, and the saint was healed of all his wounds\nstraightway.   And on the following day the governor asked for news about the saint,\nwhether he was dead or alive; now he thought that the saint was dead.  And when he found\nthat he was whole, and uninjured, he had him brought to the house of idols, where he used\nto go and pray; and when the saint came, and the governor saw that he was whole and\nuninjured, he marveled exceedingly.  And when the people who were there saw him, they\nmarveled exceedingly, and they all cried out, saying, “We are Christians openly, and we\nbelieve on the God of ‘Abrokonyos”; and among them were two noblemen and twelve\nwomen, and Theodosia, [the mother] of Saint ‘Abrokonyos.   And the governor\ncommanded the soldiers to cut off their heads with the sword, and they did so, and the\nsaints received the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens on the sixth day of\nthe month of Hamle.   Then the governor shut the saint up in prison until he could\ndetermine what to do with him, and the saint remained in prison for three days.  Then they\nbrought him out, and the governor said unto him, “Behold, I have waited three days for thy\nheart to turn, and thy soul to learn; offer up sacrifices to the gods.”  And the saint answered\nand said unto him, “Nay, O governor, my heart will not turn.  Behold, I know, and am well\nassured, that our Lord Jesus Christ is the Great God alone.  And these idols which are\nmade out of stone and wood by the hand of man, are graven images which can neither\ninjure [men] nor benefit them.”  Thereupon the governor was wroth, and he commanded\nthe soldiers to cut his sides with swords.  And the swordsman, whose name was Archelaus,\nstretched out his hand to cut the sides of the saint with his sword, whereupon his hand\n\ndried up, and he fell down and died.  And the governor was wroth, and he commanded\nthem to throw him down on the ground, and they threw the saint on the ground, and then\nthey beat him severely, and gashed his body with knives, and poured vinegar on his\nwounds, and dragged him by his feet to the prison house, and cast him into it.  And he\nremained in the prison house three days [whilst] the governor pondered what he should do\nwith him.  And after this they took him out of prison, and threw him into a pit, which was\nfilled with fire; but our Lord Jesus Christ delivered him there from, and the fire did not\ntouch him at all.  And when the governor was tired of torturing him, he commanded the\nsoldiers to cut off his head with the sword, [and they did so,] and he received the crown of\nmartyrdom and departed to joy everlasting.  Salutation to ‘Abrokonyos.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and he\nlived with him and fought a fight greater than that [usually] fought by men in his days; and\nhe fasted frequently and prayed without ceasing.   And the grace of the Holy Spirit\ndescended upon him, and he disputed with the people, and overcame them in argument. \nAnd when the Council of the father Bishops, Three Hundred and Eighteen in number,\nassembled in the city of Nicea, this saint went with his teacher Abba Jacob to the Council\nof the Saints, and overcame Arius the infidel.  That night Abba Ephraim saw a pillar of\nlight standing upon the earth, and it reached up to heaven, and when he saw it he\nmarveled.  And a voice came to him from heaven, saying, “This pillar of light which thou\nseest is the blessed Basil, Bishop of the city of Caesarea”; and he longed to see him.  And\nAbba Ephraim departed to the city of Caesarea, and went into the church, and stood in a\ncorner of it.  And he saw Saint Basil, as he went up to the throne to read the Holy Gospel,\nand he wore priestly vestments of gold, which were of great price, and he was in doubt\nabout him; and God showed him a white dove on the head of this Saint Basil.  And Saint\nBasil knew that Abba Ephraim was standing in the corner of the church, and he sent and\ncalled him by his name, and Ephraim went to him, and they saluted each other through an\ninterpreter.  And Abba Ephraim asked Abba Basil that they might talk together without an\ninterpreter, and the grace of the Holy Spirit descended upon them, and each knew the\nlanguage of the other.  And then Basil made Abba Ephraim a deacon, and after a few days\nhe was made a priest, and many virtues appeared in him; and he fought a great fight.  And\nat that time there was a certain honorable woman of high rank who was ashamed to\nconfess her sin openly to Saint Basil; and she wrote on paper a confession of all the sins\nwhich she had committed from her youth up to that day; and there remained one sin only\nwhich she did not set down in what she had written.  And then she brought the paper to\nSaint Basil, and she asked him before the people, saying, “I am a sinful woman.  And\nbehold, I have written all my sins on this paper, and I ask thee to remit them so that they\nmay be blotted out from this paper, it remaining sealed.”   And he took the paper, and\nprayed for her, and the paper became blank in every place, and all her sins were blotted out\nwith the exception of the one sin, which was a very grievous one; and when she saw it she\nwept, and entreated him to remit to her the one sin, which remained.  And he said unto her,\n“Go thou to the desert, to Abba Ephraim, and he shall remit to thee this one remaining\nsin.”  And straightway she went to Abba Ephraim, and told him what had befallen her, and\nhe said unto her, “Get thee quickly to Abba Basil before his departure from this world, for\nhe is the chief-priest, and he must remit to thee thy sin.”  And the woman returned to Abba\nBasil, and she found that he had died whilst they were carrying him in his bed on the heads\nof the priests.  And she wept and laid the paper on the body of Abba Basil, so that he might\nblot out for her the sin, which remained on the paper; and the saint blotted it out by his\nprayer.  And Abba Ephraim performed many miracles.  And in his days there appeared a\ncertain wicked denier [of Christ] whose name was Walda Didan, and this father disputed\nwith him, and overcame him; and this father composed very many Homilies, and it is\nfound written in the books that the number of the works which he composed by the Holy\nSpirit was one thousand four hundred Homilies and Admonitions.   And Abba Ephraim\nasked God, the Most High, saying, “O my Lord, take from me the waves of Thy grace.” \nAnd having finished his good fight, he departed to God, Whom he loved.  Salutation to\nEphraim.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Abba Kharayon of ‘Amsal, and Fere-Menatos,\nand five and forty martyrs, and the martyrdom of Cyriacus, (as it is written in the\n\nSynaxarium of Mesr), and Frumentius the monk and fighter, the pure man and worker of\nmany miracles.\nAnd on this day also Peter and Paul performed a miracle in the city of Rome.  And it came\nto pass, after the departure of our holy Lady the two-fold Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, that\n[the cloud] took them up and set them down in the royal palace; and when the king saw\nthem he was frightened and said unto them, “What are ye and what is your business?” \nAnd they said unto him, “We are the servants of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God,\nWho destroyeth all kingdoms, and is able to deliver those who hear Him, and to punish\nthose who hear Him not.”  And the king said unto them, “How is it possible for me to\nknow whether your words are true [or not]?”  And then they told him about all the signs\nand wonders, which our Lord Jesus Christ had wrought.  And the king said unto them, “I\nhave a daughter whose right eye a bird plucked out, and if ye heal her by your prayers I\nwill believe in your God.”  And Peter and Paul said unto the king, “Bring thy daughter to\nus?”  And straightway he brought her in haste.  And the holy apostles lifted up their hands,\nand prayed much to God, and then they laid their hands upon her eyes, and healed her in\nthe Name of the Lord Jesus Christ.  And when the people saw this they bowed down at the\nfeet of the holy apostles and believed.   And thence the holy apostles departed to the\ncountry of Philippi, even as our Lord Jesus Christ commanded them.  And Satan took the\nform of the king of ‘Endon, and he came to Pragmos, followed by a few soldiers, and he\nsaid unto him, “Why dost thou keep silence concerning the two magicians who, if we do\nnot destroy them without [mercy], will speedily corrupt the country with their magic?” \nAnd the heart of Pragmos was persuaded, and he sent to him one thousand two hundred\nhorsemen to bring the holy apostles to him, and they surrounded the city, and the men of\nthe city were frightened, and they told the holy apostles.  And the holy apostles went out of\nthe city and stood up before the people, and prayed to God to send them help.   And\nstraightway the horses of the soldiers turned and faced the holy apostles, and they cried out\nin a thin voice like that of one who weepeth, “Make straight your feet, and kneel down on\nyour knees.”  And one of the horses lifted up his voice, which was like that of a man, and\nsaid unto the soldiers, “O ye foolish soldiers of Pragmos, why do ye seek Peter and Paul,\nthe soldiers of Christ, and make them out to be magicians?   They have only come to\ndestroy the soldiers, and all the work of the devil.  Do ye not see them with their King\nJesus Christ, riding upon white horses, and making supplication on your behalf, that ye\nmay become soldiers of Christ, and that they may write your names in the Book of Life? \nAs for us beasts we will worship your God”; and having thus spoken the horse held his\npeace.  And a voice was heard which said, “O apostles, neglect ye not my new plants”; and\nwhen all the people lifted up their eyes they saw our Lord going up into heaven in great\nglory.  And when the twelve hundred soldiers saw this, they believed on our Lord Jesus\nChrist, and the submitted themselves to the holy apostles.   And the holy apostles\ncommanded them to abandon their military service, and to give back their horses to their\nking, and their weapons of war, and to believe boldly on our Lord Jesus Christ.  And the\nsoldiers went to Pragmos their king, and stood up before him, and he said unto them,\n“Where are the two magicians whom I sent you to bring?”  And they said unto him, “Why\ndost thou seek to do evil in return for the good which they did thee in bestowing light upon\nthy daughter?”  And then they unloosed their breastplates and girdles, and threw them in\nhis face, saying, “Take thy property.  We will find a better king than thyself.  We believe\non the God of Peter and Paul.”  When the king heard [these words] he was dismayed, and\nhe became furiously angry, and he commanded his soldiers to cast them into prison until\nhe could kill them.   And then he prepared to set out himself, and he made ready his\nweapons of war, and he commanded another fourteen hundred soldiers who were with him\nto set out for Pilpos, and to destroy the city down to its very foundations.  And Saint Peter\nknows of this in his spirit, and he said unto Saint Paul, “O my brother, rise up and let us go\nto King Pragmos before he cometh to destroy the city.”  Then they prayed a prayer, and\nmounted upon a cloud, and it [carried them away] and set them down in the royal palace. \nAnd they stood up before Pragmos, and said unto him,\" Do not destroy the city, and make\nus the pretext for doing so; behold, we are before thee”, and the king commanded his\nsoldiers to return.   And he said unto the holy apostles, “Are ye magicians who have\nbewitched the city?”  And they said unto him, “Far be it from us [to do] this.”  And the\n\nking said unto them, “Your sins have brought this upon you.”  And he commanded his\nservants to make two iron helmets with iron pegs in them, and to fill them with poisons\n(or, drugs), and to heat them in the fire, and to put them on the heads of the holy apostles,\nand then to hang them up head downwards; and the soldiers did this to them.  Then Saint\nPeter prayed, and said, “O Lord my God, make Thy glory to appear on Pragmos.”  And\nstraightway Pragmos and all his people were hung up head downwards in the air, and at\nthat moment Pragmos cried out, saying, “O my Lord, deliver me from this torture.  Cursed\nbe the King of ‘Endon, for it is he who hath led me into error, and cursed be every man\nwho speaketh against them.”  And Saint Peter said unto him, “Thou shalt not come down\nfrom thy hanging until thou dost give the command to thy soldiers to release the soldiers\nwho are in prison.”  And Pragmos cried out to Loy, his daughter, and commanded her to\nrelease them, and she released them, for she was the only person who was left unhung. \nAnd Saint Peter said unto him, “And now, thou shalt not come down from thy hanging\nunless thou wilt write a statement with thine own hand, saying, ‘There is no other god\nexcept my Lord Jesus Christ, the King of all the world, and on all the earth there is no\nbeing so unclean as myself’; and thou shalt command it to be proclaimed in the city.”  And\nthe king cried out, and they brought to him paper and a pen, and he wrote theses words\nwhilst he was hanging head downwards; and he sent the writing to the city, and the people\nread it there.  And straightway the holy apostles took down Pragmos and his followers. \nAnd the king came and bowed down at the feet of the holy apostles, and said unto the,\n“Forgive me, O my lords, I believe on your God.”  And all the people fell down at their\nfeet saying the same thing, and the apostles baptized them all in the Name of the Father,\nand the Son, and the Holy Spirit; and they also baptized the soldiers, and thus they were all\nunited in the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And the apostles built for them a church, and\nappointed priests and deacons from among their learned men, and they taught them the\nTrue Faith.  And they remained with them, teaching them to understand every difficult\nmatter, and they gave them all the Holy Scriptures whereby they might strengthen their\nhearts.  And they said unto them, “Be ye strong in your faith which we have taught you\nuntil we return to you.”   And after this they gave them the salutation of “Peace,” and\ndeparted to the city of Pilpesyus.  Salutation to Peter and to Paul.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and their martyrdoms took place on the seventh day of the\nmonth of Sane.  The third time he killed an old woman, who was lying on her bed inside\nher house.  And the soldiers of Arianus asked that old woman about the holy martyrs of the\ncity of ‘Esna, and she said unto them, “Behold, they are in the monastery which is called\nby the name of Agathon; for they heard of the arrival of Arianus the governor, and they\nknew that he would kill the Christians, and persecute them.”  And after this the governor\ncommanded his soldiers to kill everyone they found, and they ceased not to kill everyone\nthey found, from the western [quarter] of the city, which is called “Sekyot Karim...” And\nthey found many people on the road, and they slew them until they came to the monastery\nof the glorious father who is called “Isaac the solitary.”   And at that time this good\nshepherd, who was called Ammonius, gave them strength, and he comforted them and said\nunto them, “Be strong and endure so that ye may enter into the kingdom of heaven.”  And\nwhilst he was exhorting them thus, the governor came to them, and when they saw him\nthey all cried out with one voice, saying, “We are Christians.”   And the governor\ncommanded the soldiers to kill them with the sword like sheep, and his soldiers rose up\nand rushed upon them with swords and killed them.   And the men of the cities of\nAlexandria and ‘Esna, from the least of them to the greatest, both man and woman,\nfinished their good fight, on the nineteenth day of the month of Hamle; and the armies of\nthe angels received their souls, and crowned them with crowns of light.  And the governor\nwent to the city of Aswan, and then returned to the city of ‘Esna, where he found three\nlaborers coming from the fields and carrying the implements of their toil with them.  As\nsoon as they saw him they cried out boldly, saying, “We are Christians”; and when the\ngovernor heard this he commanded his soldiers to cut off their heads with the implements\nof their toil.   Now their names were Surufas, and Antichius, and Mashadre, and they\nfinished their martyrdom on the eleventh day of the month of Meskerem.   And the\ngovernor bound in fetters this glorious father Abba Ammonius, the bishop, and he urged\nhim to sacrifice to idols, and when he refused to do so he commanded the soldiers to cast\nhim into the fire, and they did so, and he finished his martyrdom on the fourteenth day of\nthe month of Tahsas.  And certain believing men took him and wrapped him in cloths, and\nburied him in the place, which is called Bet-Hapes; and when the days of persecution were\nended they built a church over him, and they consecrated it in his name.  Salutation to the\nmartyrs of ‘Esna.\nAnd on this day also Saint Cyriacus (Qirkos) and Julitta (Iyalota) his mother became\nmartyrs.  When this saint was a child, and his days were three years, his mother took him\nand fled from the country of Rome to another country.  And she found there the brother of\nthe governor from whom she had fled, and certain men laid information against her before\nhim, and he had her brought and questioned her about the worship of idols.  And Saint\nJulitta answered and said unto him, “Ask the child whose days are three years to tell us\nwhat is right, and whether it is good for us to worship the gods or not.”  And when the\nsoldiers of the governor went to her house they found Saint Cyriacus (Qirkos) her son, and\nthey brought him to the governor; and the governor questioned him about the worship of\nidols.  And God gave the child strength, and he spoke and cursed the emperor and his\ngods, and at length he frightened all those who were there, and they marveled greatly at\nhim.  And the governor was ashamed, and he tortured the child severely with every kind of\ntorture, the which even a grown up man could not endure, and he tortured Julitta (Iyalota),\n\nthe mother of the child, even as he tortured her son, but God raised them up whole and\nuninjured.  And because of this many people marveled, and believed on our Lord Jesus\nChrist, and became martyrs, and the grace of the Holy Spirit descended upon them.  And\nthe child Cyriacus (Qirkos) healed many sick folk, and performed great miracles.   And\nwhen fear came over his mother, and her faith dwindled, he prayed to God on her behalf,\nand God lifted up her heart unto heaven, and she saw the habitation of the spirit, and she\nbecame strong under the torture, and gave thanks to God.  And she said unto her son, “O\nmy son, henceforward thou art my father, and I am thy blessed daughter; blessed be the\nhour wherein I bore thee.”   And when the governor was tired of torturing them he\ncommanded the soldiers to cut off their heads with the sword, and they did so, and the\nsaints received the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.   Salutation to\nCyriacus (Qirkos).\nOn this day the holy and honorable Matlan (Batlan), the physician, became a martyr.  This\nsaint was from a city, the name of which is Ta’madan, and his father, whose name was\nAsturius, was an infidel, and his mother, whose name was ‘Ulana, was a believer.  When\nthe child grew up, his father taught him writing and every kind of learning (or,\nphilosophy), and he became a very great and famous physician.  And a certain man who\nwas a priest lived near their house, and when Batlan passed by, and he saw his comeliness\nand his knowledge, and his wisdom and skill, and his understanding, he was sorry for him,\nbecause he was a denier [of Christ].  And the priest entreated our Lord Jesus Christ on\nbehalf of Batlan, that He might guide him into the way of life, and bring him into the True\nFaith.  And having multiplied his petitions to God on behalf of Batlan, a time came when\nGod told the priest in a vision of the night that Batlan should believe through him, and the\npriest rejoiced.  And the priest always spoke to Batlan whenever he passed before him, and\nsaluted him, and through this custom friendship grew up between them; and Batlan used to\ngo into the priest’s house to talk with him about the Faith.  And the priest explained to him\nthe uncleanness of idols, and the corruptness of heart of those who worshipped them, and\nhe showed him the glory of the Faith of Christ, and the knowledge and understanding of\nthose who serve Him; and then he made him to know that by the hands of all those who\nbelieve in Christ our Lord miracles are wrought; and great healings effected.  And when\nSaint Batlan heard that all those who believe in Christ could perform miracles, he rejoiced\nexceedingly, and he longed to perform miracles for himself, and he fulfilled his desire with\nwisdom and worked miracles; for he believed in our Lord through that priest, who taught\nhim at all times.  And one day Saint Batlan was passing through the market place of the\ncity, and he saw a man whom a serpent had bitten lying on the ground and the serpent was\nstanding up before him.  And he said within himself, “I will stand up that I may put to the\ntest the words of the priest, my teacher, who saith unto me, ‘If thou dost belong to our\nLord Jesus Christ, thou shalt work miracles in His Name.’”  And he drew nigh unto the\nman whom the snake had bitten, and he prayed a long prayer, and asked Christ to make\nmanifest His power and heal the man, and kill the serpent, so that it might not do harm to\nany one else.  And when he had finished his prayer the man rose up alive and whole, and\nwithout pain, and the serpent fell down and died straightway.   And Batlan’s faith\nincreased, and he went to the priest who baptized him with Christian baptism, and he used\nto visit him continually.  One day a blind man came unto him that he might heal him, and\nwhen the father of the saint saw him he sent him away.  And Batlan questioned his father\nabout this, and he said unto him, “Who was the man that was enquiring for me?”  And his\nfather answered, and said unto him, “It was a blind man, and thou canst not heal him.” \nAnd the saint answered and said unto his father, “Thou shalt see [the power of] God.”  And\nhe called the blind man back, and said unto him, “If thou canst see wilt thou believe in the\nGod Who shall heal thine eyes for thee?”  And the blind man said unto him, “Yea, I will\nbelieve.”  And the saint prayed over him for a long time, and then he laid his hand upon\nthe eyes of the blind man, and said unto him, “In the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ\nreceive thy sight”; and straightway the blind man’s eyes were opened. And when the father\nof the saint saw this he believed, together with the man who was blind, on our Lord Jesus\nChrist, and Batlan took them to the priest, his teacher, who baptized them both with\nChristian baptism.  And when the father of the saint died, Batlan set his slaves free, and\ngave the greater part (?) of his money to the poor.  And he practiced medicine, and healed\n\nmen without payment, but he required those whom he healed to believe on Christ.  And the\n[other] physicians were jealous of him, and they laid information against him, and the\npriest, and the man who was blind, and many other believers, before the king.  And the\nking was wroth with them, and he said unto them, “Sacrifice ye to the gods,” but they\nrefused to obey him, and the soldiers cut off their heads with the sword and they received\ncrowns of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  And after this the king tortured Saint\nBatlan very severely, and many signs and wonders appeared through him, and many men\nbelieved through him, whilst he was under torture, and became martyrs.  And the king was\nwroth with Saint Batlan, and cast him to the lions, but they would not injure him, and only\nlicked his feet; and the king commanded the soldiers to cut off his head with the sword,\nand they did so, and thus he finished his fight, and received the crown of martyrdom in the\nkingdom of the heavens.  Salutation to Batlan.\nSalutation Isaac, the righteous man.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Abba Batrabo, and Macarius of Falga Halib, and\nMoses of Shoki.\nSalutation to Abel, the son of Takla Haymanot.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and because of this she was angry with him, and drove him away from her, and\nthe child Theodore was left with his mother.  And his father John prayed, and entreated\nGod to guide his son Theodore into the path of righteousness.  And Saint Theodore grew\nup, and studied philosophy, and [other] learning, and Christ illumined the eyes of his heart;\nand he went to a righteous bishop, whose name was ‘Alakes, who baptized him with\nChristian baptism.  And when his mother heard of this she sorrowed with a great sorrow. \nAnd after this he made enquiries concerning his father, as to whether he was alive or dead,\nand one of his servants told him the matter concerning his father privily, and how his\nmother had driven away his father, because he was a Christian.  And Saint Theodore grew\nup, and was exceedingly strong in battle, and the king made him a general.  And when the\nking went forth to fight against the men of Persia, this saint did valiantly, and he captured\nthe son of the King of Persia, who was on his horse, and all his company with him.  And\nafter a few days the Barbarians rose up against the country of Rome, and destroyed many\ncities.  And when the Emperor Diocletian heard of this he was exceedingly afraid, and he\nsummoned Theodore and said unto him, “What shall we do?   Take with thee all thy\nsoldiers, and all thy weapons of war, and set out for the war.”   And Saint Theodore\nanswered and said unto him, “Take thy weapons of war and give them to thy slaves, for I\nhave no need of weapons of war, because my trust is in the help of my Lord Jesus Christ. \nThis spear, which is in my hand, and the horse, which I ride, are profitable to me through\nthe might of my Lord Jesus Christ.  I will set out alone for the war, and will not take a\nsoldier with me, for my God will go forth with me to the war, and He, the Creator of the\nuniverse, will help me.”   And the emperor said unto him, “Do what thou pleasest, but\nbehold, our enemies have drawn nigh.”  And on the following day the saint went forth to\nwar, and the emperor said unto him, “What strength hast thou to fight against the\nBarbarians, who are a people many in number?”  And the saint answered and said unto\nhim, “Stand here with thy army, and I will go out against them alone, and thou shalt see\nwhat shall come upon them, and I believe, by God, that not one of them shall ever return\nto his house”; and the emperor and all those who were with him marveled.  And then Saint\nTheodore went to the war by himself, and he left the emperor and went a long way off\nfrom him, namely a distance of three stadia.  And when Saint Theodore arrived at the city\n(camp?) of the Barbarians, he said unto them, “Will ye fight, or will ye depart in peace?” \nAnd they said unto him, “Who are we to fight?  We do not see any men to fight except\nthyself.”  And Theodore said unto them, “I want no one, for I by myself in the might of my\nGod will destroy you all.”  And the Barbarians said unto him, “Peradventure thou hast\ncome out to fight a dog?  If thou wilt select the least among us, he shall come to thee, and\nfight thee.”  And straightway Saint Theodore came down from his horse, and turned his\nface towards the East, and he prayed, saying, “O my Lord and God, Who didst strengthen\nDaniel the prophet, and enable him to destroy the idols, and to kill the serpent in the city of\nBabylon, do Thou be with me in the same manner this day, and strengthen me by Thy help\nso that I may praise Thy Name for ever and ever, Amen.”  And when he had finished his\nprayer he took his spear in his hand, and made over it the sign of the Cross, and he leaped\nupon his horse, and cried out to the Barbarians, saying, “Come to me so that we may fight\nwith you; I am the servant of my Lord Jesus Christ.”   And straightway he charged in\namong them with his spear in his hand, and he destroyed all the Barbarians and not one of\n\nthem escaped, either on his horse, or by running away on foot.  And Saint Theodore cut off\nthe heads of their officers and brought them to the emperor with him, and the emperor and\nall his army welcomed him; and all the men of the city of Antioch bowed down before\nhim.  And they laid waste all the country of the Barbarians.  And there was in the city of\n‘Eukitos a great serpent which the people used to worship, and they gave it each day two\nmen to devour.   And there was in that city a certain woman, who was a widow and a\nChristian, and she had two sons, and the people took them and set them before the serpent\nfor it to devour them.  And at that time Saint Theodore came to the city of ‘Eukitos, and\nthe widow stood up before him weeping, and she told him all that had befallen her, and\nhow they had taken her sons for the serpent.  And when he learned that the woman was a\nChristian he said within himself, “They have wronged this woman, but God shall avenge\nher.”  And he came down from his horse, and turned his face towards the East and prayed,\nand after he had finished his prayer he drew nigh the serpent; and all the people were\nwatching him from the tops of the walls of the city.  Now the length of the serpent was\nfourteen cubits, but God gave him power over it, and he speared it with his spear and\nkilled it, and delivered the sons of the widow.  After this he departed into Upper Egypt to\nsearch for his father, and he asked about him, and they brought his father to him, and he\nknew by a certain mark that Theodore was his son.  And he lived with his father until he\ndied, and then he returned to the city of Antioch.   And he found that the Emperor\nDiocletian was denying Christ, and worshipping idols, and was bringing tribulation upon\nthe Christian folk, who believed on the Name of Christ; and he stood up before him and\nconfessed our Lord Christ.  Now the priests of the idols of the men of the city of ‘Eukitos\nhad already laid information against him before the emperor, saying, “The man who killed\nthe serpent worships [Christ].”  And on the morrow the emperor sent, and had Theodore\nbrought before him, and he said unto him, “Who dost thou do this evil thing?”  And Saint\nTheodore answered and said unto him, “Every evil work is from thee, O son of sin, who\nhast forsaken the God of heaven, and dost worship unclean idols; God shall destroy thy\nkingdom quickly.”   And straightway the emperor was wroth, and he commanded a\nhundred soldiers and they threw Theodore upon the ground, and beat him with rods in\nrelays.  And they beat him and then rested, and at length his flesh was cut into strips and\nhis blood flowed on the ground like water.  And whilst he was under this torture Michael,\nand angel of God, came down and stood before him, and said unto him, “Be strong, O\nTheodore, behold the time of the hours of thy fight hath drawn nigh, and many signs and\nwonders shall appear in the place where thy body is laid.  And behold, our Lord Jesus\nChrist promiseth thee a righteous promise, and saith unto thee.   ‘All those who shall\ncelebrate thy commemoration, or fill the hungry with good, or give alms on the day of thy\ncommemoration, or give drink to the thirsty, or shall give an offering or incense, or a book\nto the church in thy name, I will erase their sins from the roll, and they shall never see\npunishment.  Whosoever shall write a book of thy fight, or cause it to be read, or shall\nlisten to it, or shall acquire it, I will write their names in the Book of Life.’”  And when the\nangel had said this he went up to heaven in great glory.  And straightway all the soldiers of\nthe emperor and all the people gathered together, and they cried out and said unto him,\n“God shall destroy thee, O infidel, by the spirit of His mouth, and He shall do it in wrath\nbecause thou dost torture Saint Theodore, the mighty and strong man, who hath delivered\nus out of the hand of our enemies.”  And they believed on our Lord Jesus Christ, and on\nthat day many of the people and of the soldiers of the emperor became martyrs.  And after\nthis Diocletian, the infidel, commanded the soldiers and they brought an iron bed and laid\nthe saint upon it, and lighted a fire beneath it, and the flames of the fire soared upwards. \nAnd Saint Theodore said, “O my Lord, deliver Thou me as Thou didst deliver the Three\nChildren from the fiery furnace”; and straightway the fire was extinguished, and it became\ncold as dew at the time of dawn.  And there came a voice from heaven, saying, “O thou to\nwhom power hath been given by our Lord Christ, be strong!”  And straightway the saint\nstood up before the emperor and said unto him, “O infidel, be ashamed, for our Lord Jesus\nChrist hath delivered me from all torture.”  And when the general of the emperor saw this\nhe believed in our Lord Christ, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying, “There is no\ngod but the God of Saint Theodore”; and he became a martyr.  And when the emperor was\ntired of torturing him, he commanded the soldiers to cut off his head with the sword, and\nto burn his body in the fire, and by the Will of God they carried him to the door of his\n\nmother’s house, and there they cut off his head, and blood and milk flowed out.  And they\nlighted a large fire, and cast his body into it, but the fire neither touched it nor burnt a hair\nof his head.  And his mother gave much money to the soldiers, and took his body and\nwrapped it up in rich cloths, and hid it in her house until the end of the days of\npersecution.  And they built for him a church and many monasteries, and they laid his\nbody in the monastery of his father’s city Sebt in Upper Egypt, and many signs and\nwonders and great healings took place through it.  The end of his martyrdom took place on\nthe twentieth day of the month of Hamle, and he received the crown of martyrdom in the\nkingdom of the heavens.  Salutation to Theodore.\nSalutation to the purification of Hanna, the mother of Mary.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Saint Theocytus, and Saint Timothy, Archbishop\nof Alexandria, and Moses, and Julitta, and the four hundred and forty martyrs who were\nwith Cyriacus.\nSalutation to Gabra Iyasus and to Thekla.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

but God gave him\nthe strength to endure this, and He raised him up whole and uninjured.   And God\nperformed many signs and wonders by his hands, and among them are the following: \nCertain men passed before him carrying a dead man whom they were going to bury, and\nwhilst all the people were watching him Saint Macarius made entreaty to our Lord Jesus\nChrist on behalf of the dead man, and prayed Him to make manifest His praise on him;\nand then he prayed and the dead man rose up and told the people what he had seen.  And\nhe said unto them, “Christ is the Lord of the Universe,” and when they heard this many of\nthe people believed on our Lord Jesus Christ; and the soldiers cut off their heads with the\nsword, and they received the crown of martyrdom.  Now Arianus, the governor of Antinoe,\ndwelt there, and when he returned he took Saint Macarius with him.   And when they\narrived at the city of Setnuf the ship stood still (i.e. ran aground), and could not be moved;\nand when they arrived at the city of Antinoe our Lord appeared unto Saint Macarius in a\nvision and said unto him, “In this place thy fight shall finish, and in it shall thy body lie.” \nAnd the governor commanded the soldiers to put Saint Macarius upon the rack, and they\ndid so, and then they cut off his head, and he finished his fight, and received the crown of\nmartyrdom in the kingdom on the heavens.   And when Constantine reigned there was\nappointed by him a governor, whose name was Eulogius, a believer, and he commanded\nthem to open the churches, and to build up those that were ruined, and to destroy the\nhouses of idols.  And Saint Macarius appeared unto him in the night and informed him\nconcerning the place wherein was his body.   Then Eulogius rose up, and came to that\nplace, and found the body of the saint; and he took it away from there, and they built a\nchurch for it and laid it therein, and great signs and miracles took place through it. \nSalutation to Macarius.\nAnd on this day also the holy and honorable Leontius became a martyr.  This saint became\na Christian through his father, who was a soldier in the army of the infidel emperor, and\nwas a man of the city of Trablos.   He was exceedingly godly in appearance, and was\nperfect in his fight, and he read the Divine Books continually, and learned many of them\nby heart, specially the Psalms of David, which he used to recite frequently, and for this\nreason he knew them by heart.   He admonished his fellow-soldiers constantly, and he\ntaught them the fear of God, and he encouraged them and said unto them, “Waste not your\nyears in the service of idols.”   And there were some who submitted to his words, and\nturned away from their infidelity, and forsook their error, and the unclean iniquity wherein\nthey had been living hitherto; and there were others into whom Satan entered, and they\nwent to their general, and said unto him, “Leontius holdeth idols in contempt, and he\nteacheth and saith that Christ is God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, and of all\n\nthat is therein.”   And the governor had Leontius brought, and he questioned him,\nconcerning this matter, and Leontius confessed our Lord Jesus Christ before the governor,\neven as Paul the apostle saith, “Who shall separate me from the love of Christ my God,\nWhom I have served, and worshipped, from my youth up?”  (Romans viii, 35).  And the\ngovernor was wroth, and commanded the soldiers to bind him hand and foot, and cast him\ninto the prison house; and they did even as the governor commanded.   And on the\nfollowing day the governor had him brought before him, and he said unto him, “By what\npower dost thou presume to transgress the edict of the emperor and dost turn men from the\nworship of the gods?”  And the saint answered and said unto him, “In truth I would that all\nmen would enter into the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ.  If thou wilt forsake thine error,\nand the service of idols, and wilt worship our Lord and God and Redeemer Jesus Christ,\nthou shalt inherit an everlasting kingdom”; and then he cursed the gods of the governor\nand his unclean idols.  And the soldiers beat him severely, until his blood ran down upon\nthe ground, and all the while they were torturing him he glorified God and sang his\npraises.  And one of the soldiers was sorry for him, and he whispered in his ear, and said\nunto him, “I am sorry for thee.  Have pity on thy youth and speak only one word, and tell\nthe governor that thou wilt sacrifice to the gods, and I will undertake to set thee free.”  And\nthe saint cursed him, and thrust him away from him, saying, “Get thee from me, Satan!” \nAnd when the governor saw his endurance, and his fortitude, he doubled his torture; and at\nlength his body was cut into strips and his blood poured on the ground.  Then the governor\ncommanded them to drown him in the river, or to drag him by the feet and cast him into\nprison until he could decide what to do with him; and when they had done these things to\nhim he died in prison.   And a certain woman who was a believer came and gave the\nkeepers of the prison house and the soldiers much money, and she took the saint and\nwrapped him up in new and costly cloths, and she made a covering worked with gold to\nspread over his bier, and she laid him in a coffin in the house, and had a picture of him\npainted upon it; and she hung before it a lamp which burned continually.  Salutation to\nLeontius, the lamp of Trablos.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated Saint Markolos (Marcellus).\nSalutation to Longinus.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

now at that time Decius was\nemperor.   And when Saint Marina was five years old her mother died, and her father\ncommitted her to a nurse so that she might live outside the city; now this nurse was a\nChristian, and she taught Marina all the Faith of Christ.  And when Marina reached the age\nof fifteen years, her father died.  One day she heard her nurse talking about the labors and\nfights of the martyrs, and the love of Christ entered her heart, and she went about seeking\nto become a martyr.  And a wicked governor came to this city, and as soon as he saw her\nhe commanded the soldiers to bring her before him, and he said unto her, “Whence art\nthou?  What is thy name?”  And she said, “I am one of the people of Jesus Christ, and my\nname is Marina.”  When the governor saw her grace and her beauty, he could not restrain\nhimself, and he persuaded her with many words to consent to his wish.  When she cursed\nhim, and reviled his gods, he commanded the soldiers to beat her with iron rods, and to cut\noff her limbs, and to scrape her body until her blood flowed like water, and he also\ncommanded them to scrape her members with an iron scraper, [and they did so]; but when\nSaint Marina prayed to God, Michael the Archangel came and healed her.   And the\ngovernor commanded them to take her into a prison house, which was filled with darkness,\nand whilst she was praying the Archangel Michael came, and lighted up the prison house,\nand took her up into heaven, where he showed her the dwelling of the saints and the\nrighteous, and then he brought her back to her place.   And on the following day the\ngovernor commanded the soldiers to scrape her with an iron scraper, and to slit her body\nwith butchers’ knives, and to cast her into prison; and Saint Michael came and healed her. \nAnd whilst she was standing up praying, a huge and most terrifying serpent came forth\nfrom this prison, and when she saw it she was frightened and her whole body trembled,\nand she could not speak.  And the serpent swallowed her up, her hands being extended in\nthe form of a cross, and she was praying in her heart.  Thereupon the belly of the serpent\nwas split open, and Marina went forth from him uninjured, and she gave thanks to God. \nAnd when she turned towards the prison house, she saw Satan seated, and he was in the\nform of a black man, with his hands clutching his knees.  And having made the sign of the\nCross over her face, she seized him by the hair of his head, and beat him with a rod\nseverely.  And then there was revealed unto her the wood of the Cross of Jesus Christ, and\na white dove was sitting upon it, and it spoke, saying, “Rejoice, O Marina, for there is\ncommitted to thee the pledge of the grace of the Holy Spirit.”  And on the following day\nthe governor commanded the soldiers to strip her naked, and to hang her up, head\ndownwards, and to burn her body with fire, and to cast her into a cauldron of boiling\nwater; [and they did so].  And as she was standing up in the cauldron and praying, a dove\ncame down from heaven, and he had in his beak a crown of gold, and he loosed her fetters,\nand dipped her in the water thrice, in the Name of the Father and the Son and the Holy\nSpirit; and she went forth from the water praising God.  And when the governor saw that\nshe was still alive he commanded them to cut off her head with the sword.  And when she\nhad come into the place of martyrdom she prayed to God that He would receive her soul in\npeace.  And our Lord Jesus Christ came unto her, and gave her a promise that He would\nforgive the sins of everyone who should call upon her name, or write the history of her\nstrife, or have it read, or should hear it read; and then the soldiers cut off her head with the\nsword.   And many miracles became manifest [through her], the blind saw, the lame\nwalked, the deaf heard, and the dumb spoke; and countless folk believed on our Lord Jesus\nChrist.  Salutation to Marina.\nAnd on this day also Saint Longinus became a martyr.  This saint came from the country\nof Cappadocia, but by race he was a Greek.   And when Tiberius Caesar reigned, he\nappointed Pilate governor of the land of Judah, and he gave this Saint Longinus to him\n\namong his other soldiers.  And when the time arrived, and the Lord wished to suffer for the\nsalvation of His people, He permitted the wicked Jews to perform this thing.  When they\nhad made themselves ready for this deed, this Longinus was one of the soldiers whom\nPilate commanded to crucify our Lord.   And because of this the Jews gave him much\nmoney, and he worked and did the will of the Jews, and he pierced our Lord with a spear\nafter He had delivered up His soul, and blood and water flowed from His side.  And when\nthis saint saw this he marveled exceedingly.  And when, at the time of the Crucifixion, he\nsaw that the sun became dark, and that the moon became like blood, and that the curtain of\nthe Temple was rent, and that the rocks were split open, and that the dead rose up, his\nwonder was greatly increased; now he had heard and seen the miracles which our Lord\nperformed from His Birth to His Crucifixion.  And when the righteous Joseph took the\nbody of our Lord and Redeemer, and laid it in the cave, this saint was standing there with\nthe guards when they sealed the tomb.  And when our Lord rose, the tomb being sealed,\nthis Longinus was dismayed, and he asked God to explain to him this mystery.  And our\nLord sent unto him the Apostle Peter, and he found him on the day of the Resurrection of\nour Lord.  And Longinus asked the Apostle Peter, and adjured him to tell him the whole\nhistory of the Redeemer; and the Apostle Peter told him everything, which had been\nprophesied concerning our Redeemer, and how He was the Son of the Living God.  And\nthis saint believed through the Apostle Peter, and he abandoned the service of an earthly\nking, and departed to the country of Cappadocia, and he preached therein in the Name of\nour Lord Jesus Christ, like the Apostles.  When Pilate heard about this he was exceedingly\nwroth, and sent and reported him to Tiberius, and the emperor had him brought and\ntortured him and cut off his head with the sword; and the saint received the crown of\nmartyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  Salutation to Longinus.\nAnd on this day also Saint ‘Abtlemanos (Ptolemy), of Shoka, became a martyr.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

Matthew v,\n18).”  And straightway he rose up, and gave all his money to the poor and needy, and he\ndeparted to the city of Gamnudi, walking thither on his feet along the river bank, and he\nfound the governor Lucius, and he confessed before him the Name of our Lord Jesus\nChrist.  And the angel of God appeared unto him there, and encouraged him and told him\neverything, which should happen to him; and the governor tortured him very severely. \nAnd when the governor went to the south he took the saint with him, and he hung him up\nupon the mast of the ship.  And the governor sat down to eat and to drink, and immediately\nhe did so the vessel which was in his hand stood still like a stone, and the eyes of the\nsoldiers were blinded.  And the angel of God came down from heaven, and released the\nsaint from his hanging position, and he wiped up the blood, which had run down from his\nnose and mouth, and then the wind blew and they came to the city of Athribis.  And the\ngovernor of Athribis knew what had happened to the governor of Gamnudi, and when the\nsoldiers saw it they unfastened their belts, and cast them before the governor, and they\nconfessed our Lord Christ and became martyrs.  And they tortured Saint Abba Nob very\nseverely in Athribis.  They laid him on an iron bed, and lighted a fire beneath it, and Abba\nNob prayed whilst he was on the iron bed, and God delivered him.  And after this the\nsoldiers sawed him asunder with a saw, and they cut off his limbs, and the angel of God\ncame down from heaven and delivered him, and raised him up whole and unharmed.  And\nthen they took the saint to the city of Alexandria, and they tortured him there severely, and\nthey heaped on him deadly serpents, but they neither approached him nor harmed him. \nAnd one of the serpents went and coiled itself round the neck of the governor, who asked\nAbba Nob to have mercy upon him.  And the saint commanded the serpent to leave the\ngovernor, and it came down off his back, and the governor commanded the pagan priests\nand the magicians to burn it with fire.  And Julius, who was from the city of ‘Akfahas,\ncame to Abba Nob, and asked him about his fight, and the name of his city, and he wrote\ndown all [the story of] his fight.  And when the governor was tired of torturing him, he\ncommanded the soldiers to cut off his head with the sword; and our Lord Christ appeared\nunto him, and comforted him and told him great healing should be derived from his body\nwherever it might be laid.   And He said that God would deliver from his tribulation\neveryone who should ask this from Him in the name of Abba Nob, and that God would\nforgive the sins of every one who celebrated his commemoration, or who satisfied the\nhungry with food, or who gave drink to him that was parched, or who gave incense or an\noffering [to the church], or who wrote a copy of the book of his fight.   And then the\nsoldiers cut off his head, and he received the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the\nheavens.  And Julius took the body of Abba Nob, and sent it with his servants to the city of\nNekhisa, and when the days of persecution were ended, they built a church in his name,\nand many signs and miracles took place in it.  And the body of the saint is in the town of\nGamnudi to this day.  Salutation to Nob.\n\nAnd on this day also Abba Takla ‘Adonaya, of Debre Libanos, and Tewolde Medhin, and\ntheir companions, became martyrs.\nAnd on this day also fourteen thousand and eighty-four companions of Abba Nob (var.\nnineteen thousand and eighty-four) became martyrs.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Simon, the forty-second Archbishop of the\ncity of Alexandria.   This saint came from the East, and his parents brought him to the\nmonastery of the west of the city of Alexandria, wherein is the body of Saint Severus; and\nhe became a monk there, and he learned to read and to write, and he learned by heart the\nBooks of the Church.  And Abba Agathon made him a priest, and after this God chose him\nto become archbishop; and when he was appointed priest he served his spiritual father in\nthe administration of the archiepiscopate.  And he lived by himself, fasting, and praying,\nand reading the Scriptures, and he ate only bread, and salt, and cumin, and uncooked\nherbs.  And he fought a perfect fight, and his devotion was sincere, and he made the soul\nof lust, which was in him to be subject to his rational and understanding soul.  And God\nwrought great signs and miracles by his hands, among which were the following:  Certain\nmen of the priests of the city of Alexandria were envious of him, and they went to some\nmagicians and gave them much money, and they prepared a deadly poison for them, and\ngave it to them.  And those evil priests took that poison, and mixed it with some drink, and\npoured it into a glass, and gave it to the archbishop and then they asked him to drink, and\nto give them his blessing.  And the archbishop drank that drink after he had received the\nHoly Mysteries, and no harm whatsoever came to him.  And after this they mixed that\npoison [with other things], and gave it to him a second and a third time, and it did him no\nharm, and the priests marveled at his escape.  Then they went to the market and found new\nfigs there, and they bought some and worked up some of that poison in some of the figs;\nand the wicked priests arranged together to give him the poisoned [figs] before he received\nthe Holy Mysteries and was fasting.  And the magicians said unto them, “If ye can make\nhim swallow it, his belly will split open straightway.”  And those deniers [of Christ] went\nto him with deceit, and they asked the archbishop to eat of the figs, and they pressed him,\nand against his will they thrust the figs into his mouth; now he did not wish to swallow\nthem before he received the Holy Mysteries.  And having swallowed them, his belly was\nmoved that night, and he remained sick for four days.  And the angel of God appeared unto\nhim in a vision by night, and made known to him the cause of his sickness, and he\nrevealed unto him the names of those who had prepared the poison for him.  And in those\ndays ‘Abd Al-aziz, Khalifah of Egypt, came to the city of Alexandria, and Abba Simon,\nthe archbishop, went out to welcome him.  And the Khalifah saw the traces of his illness\non the face of this father, and he asked the scribes, saying, “What hath happened to the\narchbishop that his appearance is thus?”  And they told him what had happened, and how\nthey had prepared poison for him; and the Khalifah was wroth, and commanded [his\nsoldiers] to burn the priests and the magicians in the fire.  And the archbishop bowed down\nto the ground and wept, and besought the Khalifah to have mercy on them, and the\nKhalifah said unto him, “Assuredly not, nay they shall burn them in the fire as they\ndeserve.”   And the father said unto him, “If thou dost burn them, I shall have neither\npriests nor archiepiscopate”; and the Khalifah marveled at his gentleness and compassion. \nAnd the Khalifah commanded, and the soldiers drove into exile the priests, and burned the\nmagicians in the fire by Karos.  And the Khalifah loved this holy father greatly, and paid\nhim much honor, and he commanded him to build churches and monasteries; and the\narchbishop built churches, and he built [one] by the city of Al-Wah to the south of Egypt,\nand very many other churches.   And God made manifest great miracles by his hands,\namong them being the following:  By his prayer he raised up to life a certain priest called\nMinas, after he was dead and had been made ready for burial; and the description of his\nraising up is thus.  This father Simon had appointed Minas to be the administrator of all\nthe property of the Church, and he had to take car of the sacred moneys and endowments,\nand the sacred vestments were laid up in his charge.  And this father used to charge him\nalways, saying, “Do not let any of the money and property of the Church be laid up in thy\nhouse.”  And it fell out that a sickness came upon him suddenly, and his tongue stuck fast\nin his throat, and his heart failed him.  When the archbishop heard of it he was exceedingly\nsorry, and he kept vigil all that night, and prayed to God on behalf of that priest, and asked\n\nHim to raise up that priest from the dead, because of the property of the Church.  And at\nmidnight this father heard that the priest was nigh to die, and he sent his disciple to the\nwife of the priest, and commanded him to ask her about the property of the Church; and\nwhen his disciple drew near to the house of the priest he heard the outcries of the people\nthereof, who were weeping for the priest.  And he went in and found that he was dead, and\nthat they were dressing him in the vestments of the priesthood and laying him on the bier;\nand there were many men round about him weeping for him.  And the disciple bowed his\nhead in salutation to the priest, and straightway the dead man rose and sat up, and he\nembraced the disciple with his arms and hands, and he said unto him, “God is the God of\nthe honorable father, Abba Simon.”  And the disciple said unto him, “Be strong, O priest,\nand fear not.”  And the priest said unto him, “Verily, I am strong through the prayer of my\nlord father, the archbishop, and God hath given me life again, and hath raised me up from\nthe dead.”  And the disciple called the priests who were struck with dismay at the death of\nthat priest, and he said unto them, “Be not dismayed, behold the priest Minas hath risen\nfrom the dead.”  And when the priests and the people came to him, the priest said unto\nthem, “Know ye that I was dead, and they set me before the throne of my Lord Christ. \nAnd I saw all the archbishops of the city of Alexandria, from Mark the apostle, to Abba\nIsaac, and they were standing before our Lord Christ.  And they rebuked me, saying, ‘Why\nhast thou hidden the property of the Church from our brother Simon the archbishop?’  And\nour Lord Christ commanded them, saying, ‘Cast him into the Outer Darkness.’  And when\nthey dragged me along to cast me out, the archbishops bowed down before our Lord\nChrist, and asked Him, saying, ‘Have mercy upon us this time.  Our brother Simon, the\narchbishop, is at this moment standing up and praying for him, and for the property of the\nChurch which was laid up with him.’   And God accepted their petition, and He\ncommanded and [the angels] put back my soul into my body.  And God said unto me,\n‘Behold, I have had compassion on thee for the sake of My chosen ones, and for the sake\nof their brother Simon, the archbishop.  And if thou dost not speak of thine own free will,\nand reveal unto him where the property of the Church is, thou shalt not return hither, and I\nwill not accept their petition on thy behalf, according to what the Lord telleth Me, and I\nwill not make thee to live after thy death.’”  And when all the people who were there heard\nthese words, and saw this miracle, they marveled exceedingly, and they praised God the\nMost High; and straightway their sorrow and weeping were turned into joy.  And after that\npriest was restored to life he remained many days, and he used to relate this miracle to\nevery man.  And this father Abba Simon continued to fight the fight and to devote himself\nto God, and to teach his flock, and to admonish them and to encourage them in the True\nFaith, and after this he died in peace.  Salutation to Simon the archbishop.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and there was in that place a certain\nbeliever, whose name was Sefaros, who took Saint Paul, and set him in his house.  And a\ngreat many people gathered together to him, and they heard his teaching.  And when this\nvirgin Thecla heard Saint Paul, the apostle, teaching, she looked out from the window of\nher house that she might hear his doctrine, and she did this for three days and three nights. \nAnd she was so eager to hear his doctrine, that she neither ate nor drank; and the word of\nhis teaching entered into her heart.   And her parents and her servants were very sorry, and\nthey used to beseech her to turn from her counsel, and not to follow Saint Paul.  And her\nfather went to Demas and Remoganos, the magistrates, and complained to them about\nwhat had happened to his daughter, and they urged him, and at length he went to the\nemperor.  And he cried out and laid information against Saint Paul, and the emperor had\nhim brought into the hall of the emperor, and he questioned him about his work and his\nFaith, but found no cause of complaint [against him]; and the emperor commanded and the\nsoldiers shut Saint Paul up in prison.  And Saint Thecla put off her ornamental attire, and\ncame to saint Paul in the prison house, and she bowed down at his feet.  And her parents\nsought for her, and could not find her, and [her handmaiden] told them that she was with\nSaint Paul the apostle; and the governor commanded the soldiers to burn her in the fire. \nAnd her mother cried out, saying, “Burn her in the fire, so that all the numerous women of\nnoble families who believe in the teaching of Paul the apostle may be admonished.”  And\nthey brought Thecla out from Saint Paul to burn her, and they brought Saint Paul out also. \nAnd her heart was bold, and she saw Saint Paul praying, and he went up into heaven\nwhilst in his body; and when he had made the sign of the Cross over her face and her body,\nshe threw herself into the fire; and the women wept for her.  And at that moment God sent\nvery much rain, and lightning and hail, and the red-hot furnace became like unto cool\ndew.  And she escaped from the fire, and ran and came to saint Paul in the place wherein\nhe dwelt secretly; and she asked him to shave off the hair of her head, so that she might\nfollow him; and he did this for her.  And when she went to the city of Antioch, a certain\nnobleman saw her, and wanted to marry her, for she was very beautiful in her appearance,\nbut she made bold and cursed him, and he informed the governor of the city about her. \nAnd the governor commanded the soldiers to cast her to the lions, and she was with the\nlions for two days and two nights, but the lions only licked her feet.  And after this they\ntied her between two oxen and dragged her through all the city, but she suffered no pain\nwhatsoever.   Then the governor sent her away, and she went to saint Paul, and he\ncomforted her, and strengthened her, and commanded her to depart, and preach the Faith\nof our Lord Jesus Christ.  And she went to the city of Konia, and preached in the Name of\nour Lord Jesus Christ, and then she went to her own city and converted her father and her\nmother, and brought them into the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And having finished her\nfight she died in peace and received the crown of the preachers and confessors in the\nkingdom of the heavens.  Now her body resteth at the present time in the city of Sengar\n\n[near Damietta] in Lower Egypt, and many signs and wonders have appeared through it. \nSalutation to the apostolic woman Thecla.\nAnd on this day also Saint ‘Adonin (Andonina) became a martyr.  This young man was a\nnative of the city of Bana, and his parents were among the elders of the city; and they were\nbelievers, and were excellent and merciful.  And this saint went to the city of Antinoe and\nconfessed our Lord Jesus Christ before the governor, who commanded the soldiers to\nshoot him to death with arrows; and they did as he commanded, but the arrows did the\nsaint no harm.  Then the governor had him bound, and sent him to the city of Alexandria,\nand with him were Saint Abba Bimakos, and two other martyrs; and the governor of the\ncity of Alexandria shut them up in prison.   And they hung up Saint ‘Adonin, head\ndownwards, until much blood flowed from his mouth down upon the ground, and then he\ntortured him severely; and when the governor was tired of torturing him, he sent him to the\ncity of Farma, where the saint found Saint Minas in prison; and he rejoiced in him, and\nthey comforted each other.  And the governor of the city of Farma tortured him with every\nkind of torture, and they cut his flesh into strips with red-hot saws, and after that he boiled\nhim in a cauldron over a fire, but God raised him up whole and uninjured.  And when he\nwas tired of torturing him he commanded the soldiers to cut off his head, and they cut off\nhis head with a sword, and he received the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the\nheavens.   And great miracles took place through his body, which healed all those who\nwere sick.  Salutation to ‘Adonina the martyr.\nAnd on this day also Saint Abba Isaac became a martyr.  This saint was a man of the city\nof Samama (Samma), and he was a gardener, and he was an excellent man, gentle, and\ndevoted to God.  He ate no flesh, he drank no wine, he fasted two days at a time, he ate\nherbs, and he visited the poor and needy, and gave them what was left of his wages.  And\nour Lord appeared unto him in a vision, and commanded him to go to the governor, and\nconfess His Name before him.  And our Lord promised him many things, and told him of\nthe crowns which were prepared for him, and the saint rejoiced exceedingly.  And he rose\nup and gave what was left in his house to the poor and needy, and then he prayed and\nasked God to help him.  And he came to the governor, and confessed God the Most High\nbefore him, and the governor tortured him severely, and burned him with fire, and hacked\noff his limbs, and hanged him, and broke him on the wheel; but God gave him strength to\nendure under all this torture, and He raised him up sound and uninjured.  When he was\ntired of torturing him the governor commanded the soldiers to cut off his head with the\nsword, and thus he received the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  And\nmen of the city of Samama came and took his body, and wrapped it in splendid cloths, and\nlaid him in a fair place until the end of the days of persecution.   [Then] they built a\nbeautiful church for him, and laid his body therein, and great signs and miracles appeared\nthrough it, and healings for many sick folk.  Salutation to Isaac, the gardener.\nAnd on this day also Liyarya (Hilaria) became a martyr.  This saint was a native of the city\nof Lemdeya (Demyal), which is nigh unto the city of Demera, and her parents were\nbelievers and were excellent folk; and she herself was chaste both in mind and in body,\nand she fasted and prayed continually.  When her days were eleven years, and she was\nliving and doing her work, our Lord Jesus Christ revealed to her a great light, and the\nArchangel Fanuel appeared, and said unto her, “Why sittest thou here doing nothing but\nfighting the spiritual fight whilst the crowns which are prepared for those who fight for the\nName of Christ, our Lord, [are waiting for thee]?”  And when she heard this she rose up,\nand gave all her goods to the poor and needy, and departed to Tuw, and thence to the city\nof Sarsana, and confessed our Lord Jesus Christ before the governor.  And there was a\ncertain holy man, whose name was Abba Sinoda, and our Lord Jesus Christ had appeared\nunto him, and informed him concerning this holy woman, and what would become of her;\nand when he saw her he rejoiced in her, and comforted her and strengthened her heart. \nAnd the governor tortured her severely, and he made gashes in all her body, and drove red-\nhot iron pegs into her; and after this he bound her with seven thousand, six hundred\nmartyrs.  Then he took her with him in a ship and departed.  And whilst they were on the\nship, a fish rose up and snatched away a child from his mother, and she had no other child,\nand she wept and lamented for her son exceedingly.  And the saint had compassion upon\n\nher, and prayed to God on her behalf, and then our Lord commanded the fish to give back\nthe child, and the fish gave him back to his mother, alive, and no harm had befallen him. \nAnd when the governor arrived in the city of Tuw, he commanded the soldiers to put the\nsaint in the furnace of the public baths, and they did as he commanded, but no harm came\nto her.  And then they hacked off her limbs, and cast her into the fire, and they plucked out\nthe nails of her hands and feet, and cut out her tongue, and drove iron pegs through her\nfeet; after this, they made her to lie on an iron bed, and lighted a fire under her.  And when\nhe was tired of torturing her, he commanded the soldiers to cut off her head, and thus she\nreceived the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  Salutation to Telyarya\n(Hilaria), and salutation to those who were martyred with her.\nAnd on this day also Thecla and Mugi, from the city of Kayrakus, on the border of\nBahyara (Bahraya) by the city of Alexandria, became martyrs.  These saints were brought\nup by a God-fearing teaching woman in the city of Karakus, and as they were sailing on\nthe river one showed them the governor torturing Christian folk, and they marveled at his\nhard-heartedness; these saints were those who endured his torture.  And the angel of God\nappeared unto the saints, and showed them the glory of the saints, and strengthened them,\nand the angel sailed with them on the ship to the city of Alexandria.  And our holy Lady,\nthe two-fold Virgin, Mary, the God-bearer, and Elisabeth, appeared unto her in the forms\nof two women, and they wept with them.   And when they came unto the city of\nAlexandria, they confessed our Lord Jesus Christ before the governor, who tortured them\nseverely.  And they cut off the head of Saint Mugi with the sword, and she received the\ncrown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens; and the governor sent Saint Thecla to\nthe city of Demow, where she became a martyr.  Salutation to Thecla and Mugi.\nAnd on this day also Saint Abba Karazun became a martyr.  This saint was a man from the\ncity of Banwan, and he was formerly a thief, and there were with him two other young\nmen who were thieves.  And they went to the cell of a certain monk in the desert of Scete\nto steal his goods, and they found him keeping vigil and standing up in prayer; so they\nwaited until he had finished his prayer and had lain down.  Now that monk never slept,\nand their hearts were afraid and dismayed.  And when the time of dawn came, the elder\nmonk went out to the thieves, and when they saw him they bowed down at his feet, and\ncast down their swords before him, and became monks under his direction.  And this saint\nfought a very great fight, and devoted himself to the ascetic life, both soul and body, and a\ncertain elder monk prophesied and informed him that he would, assuredly, become a\nmartyr for the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And when seven years had passed by, Satan\nbrought tribulation on the churches and on the Christian people.  And this saint embraced\nhis spiritual father, and received his blessing, and departed to the city of Nakyos, where he\nfound the Emperor Maximianus; and he confessed our Lord Jesus Christ before the\ngovernor.  And the governor tortured him severely, and sawed his body with iron saws, and\nrubbed into his wounds vinegar mixed with salt; and then he took him to the city of\nAlexandria, and hung him up on the mast of the ship five times; and the ropes broke.   And\nthen he cast him into a vessel made of hide, and threw him into the sea (or, river), but the\nangel of God brought him out of the sea, and commanded him to go to the city of\nGamnudi.  And he departed and came to the city of Benwani, and the people asked him\nabout Abba Karazun, for they did not recognize him.  And they said unto him, “Abuna\nAbba Karazun departed many days ago, and we do not know where he is, and we have had\nno news of him.”  And a certain maiden recognized him and knew him, and by reason of\nher great fear she fell down and broke her water jar.  And she said unto the people, “This\nman is Abba Karazun himself,” and all the men of the city made haste to go to him, and\nthey were blessed by him.   And every man who was sick came to him, and the saint\nbesought God and prayed over some oil, and anointed him therewith, and they were\nhealed.  And then he went to the city of Gamnudi, and he said unto a soldier, “I am a\nChristian, bind me and drag me into this city”; and the soldier did as the saint commanded\nhim.   And when he had brought him thither, the governor hanged him on a tree, head\ndownwards, for ten days; and the blood flowed down from his mouth and nose upon the\nground.  And Abba Karazun cursed the daughter of the general, and she died and remained\nin her grave for eighteen days, and the people came and besought the saint on her behalf. \nAnd he prayed and entreated our Lord Jesus Christ, and He raised up the maiden from the\n\ndead, and she told them what she had seen of the Judgment in hell.   And Justus the\ngeneral, and his wife, believed on our Lord Jesus Christ, and all his soldiers, and they\nbecame martyrs; and they were in number nine hundred, and thirty, and five souls.   And\nafter this the governor sent Abba Karazun to the city of Alexandria, and when he arrived\nthere they tortured him very severely.  And he also sent him to the city of Gamnudi, where\nthey beat him with bars of wood and broke his back; and when he was tired of torturing\nhim he sent him to the city of Alexandria.   And when the saint came to the Hill of\nBarmuda, our Lord Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, appeared unto him, and comforted him,\nand told him that he should finish his fight there, and He promised him that He would\ngrant to every man any request, which he should make in his name.   And when the\ngovernor was tired of torturing him he commanded the soldiers to cut off his head with the\nsword, and thus the saint finished his martyrdom, and received the crown thereof in the\nkingdom of the heavens.  And the angel of God appeared unto a certain priest of the men\nof the city of Manuf, and told him where the place was wherein the body of Saint Abba\nKarazun lay, and commanded him to take it away.  And that priest went and took the body\nof the saint, and wrapped it up in beautiful cloths, [and kept it] until the end of the days of\npersecution.  And they built a beautiful church for him in the city of Benwan and laid his\nbody therein, and many miracles and wonders took place through it.  Salutation to Abba\nKarazun.  Salutation to the nine hundred and thirty-five people who were martyred with\nAbba Karazun.\nAnd on this day also is celebrated the commemoration of seven thousand, three hundred\nmartyrs.  [In the Bodleian MS. seventy-six thousand.]\nAnd on this day also Saint Ladimadyos, the Syrian, became a martyr.   This saint was\nbrought up with the Persians, and learned from them the knowledge of the stars; and he\nwished to become a Christian.  And he found a certain Persian priest in the bazaar, whose\nname was ‘Engalius, and he taught him the Law of God and rejoiced in him exceedingly;\nand he began to teach the men of his house to turn to God and to believe in Him.  And then\nhe went to a certain city between Syria and Rome, and was there baptized with Christian\nbaptism.  He became a monk, and fought a great, and superhuman fight; and the brethren\nwere jealous of him when they saw his fight; and they wished to drive him away from the\nmountains.  When he knew this he went forth from that place and departed to a city on the\nborders of [the city of] Theodosius, and he came to the monastery of Saint Sergius; where\nhe lived with an elder anchorite for a year, and fought the fight.  And he ate neither beans,\nnor any food with fat therein.   And the elder anchorite urged the abbot to make\nLadimadyos a deacon, so that he might minister with him in the sanctuary; and being\nunable to resist him, he was made a deacon, and ministered with him in the sanctuary. \nAnd when the elder went into the altar at the consecration of the Offering, during the\nconsecration, he saw a white dove of most beautiful appearance, and it came near and\ndescended upon the altar.   And Ladimadyos, thinking that it was a dove of flesh, was\nafraid lest the chalice should be overturned, and he made a motion with his hand, and\ndrove the dove off; now the elder anchorite did not see the dove.  And after the Service\nwas ended, the anchorite asked him, saying, “What happened to disturb thee at the time of\nthe Offering, when thou didst stretch out thine hand over the altar?”  And Ladimadyos told\nhim how he had seen the dove.  And the anchorite said unto him, “In future when thou\nseest the dove tell me.”  And when the elder went up to the altar to receive the Offering,\nand the time for seeing the dove came, Ladimadyos said unto him, “That dove hath come”;\nand the elder did not see it, and again he was exceedingly sorry.  And he bowed low before\nGod, and he prayed continually, and entreated Him with tears by night and by day, until he\nsaw that dove; and he knew that it was the grace of the Holy Spirit; but he told Saint\nLadimadyos nothing, so that he might not be puffed up in his heart.  And after this the\nanchorite went to the bishop, and asked him to make Ladimadyos a priest, now\nLadimadyos himself knew nothing about this, until he took him and made him a priest\nagainst his will.  And when the Archbishop of that country heard the story of his fight, he\ntook some people with him, and wanted to go with them to him, and to receive a blessing\nfrom him.  And Saint Ladimadyos knew of this by the Holy Ghost, and he fled secretly,\nand came to the church of Saint Mark, the martyr, and then he departed and dwelt in the\ndesert, where he lived on grass, and God, the Most High, performed great miracles [by his\n\nhands].  And then he fled from the vain praise of man to the seashore.  And one day he\ntook the water-pot, and went down to the river to draw water, and he saw women there\ndrawing water, and they laughed at him, and made a mock of him; and he went back\nwithout having drawn water, and with sorrow in his heart.  And he asked God to dry up\nthat river, and God, the Most High, heard his petition, and He made the river a road\nwhereon men could travel.  And when the people knew that it was Saint Ladimadyos who\nhad dried up the river, they all went up to him with their wives, and their children, and\nthey entreated him with many tears, until he prayed to our Lord Jesus Christ Who gave\nthem back the river, and it became as it was formerly.   And when he saw the people\nwishing to honor him, he fled from that place and went to another desert, and he lived\ntherein a year, fighting the fight, and enduring the cold of winter, and the heat of summer,\nunder the sky without a roof.  And with great difficulty the people forced him to let them\nbuild him an abode, and he dwelt therein, and God, the Most High, performed many signs\nand miracles by his hands, and among them was the following:  There was a certain man\nwho was blind in one eye, and when he was being blessed by him the hand of the saint\nrested upon the blind eye of that man, and his eye was opened straightway, and he saw. \nAnd another man, a paralytic, they brought to him, and he prayed over some oil and water,\nand anointed him therewith, and the man recovered.  Another man, one who was dumb,\nwhen they brought him to him, the saint knew that this sickness had come upon the man\nbecause of the sin which he had committed; and then he prayed to God, the Most High,\nand He healed him by his hands.  And again, a certain rich man came to him with his wife,\nwho was barren, and the saint prayed to our Lord Jesus Christ, and He gave them children,\nwhom they brought to him, and he blessed them.   And this Saint Abba Ladimadyos\nperformed countless miracles.  And it came to pass in his days that the Emperor Walitos,\nthe infidel and idolater, came to the city of Antioch, and he pulled down the churches\nwhich Constantine had builded.  And then he heard that the Persians had come to fight\nagainst him, and when they (the Romans) had departed thither, they passed by the\nhabitation of Saint Ladimadyos, and one told the emperor about him.  And the soldiers\nstoned him, and his disciple, with stones, until a great heap of stones stood over their\ncave.  And thus died Ladimadyos and his disciple.  And after one year God revealed his\nbody to a certain man, who was a merchant, and was traveling that way, now he had a\nladen camel with him, and the camel fell down, and sank into a pit in the ground.  And\nwhen the men came to take up the camel, God showed him the cave, and he and his men\nknew that it was the cave of Saint Ladimadyos; and they dug and took up the body of the\nsaint, and that of his disciple, with great honor.   On the fifteenth day of the month of\nHamle, on the day whereon he died, they built a church for Saint Ladimadyos, and they\nlaid therein his body, and that of his disciple; and God made manifest many signs and\nmiracles there from.  Salutation to Ladimadyos.\nSalutation to ‘Atrabius, who took the place of Pachomius.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated the Seven Thousand Martyrs of Athribis, and\nAmon and Mary.  Salutation to the Seven Thousand Martyrs of Athribis. \nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

he lived before his marriage forty years, and after\nhis marriage fifty-two years, and after his wife died, nineteen years, and three years before\nthe Incarnation of our Redeemer.  And our Lord Jesus Christ came to him at the time of his\ndeath, and laid His hand upon his eyes and wept over him, and He bestowed upon his body\nthe gracious gift of never growing old, and upon his bones the gift of incorruptibility.  And\nthey laid him in the grave of Jacob, his father, in the tenth year of the Incarnation of our\nLord Jesus Christ.  Salutation to Joseph and Mary.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father, Abba Timothy, the twenty-second Archbishop of\nthe city of Alexandria.   This saint was the brother of the Archbishop Saint Peter his\npredecessor, and having been appointed he shepherded the rational flock of Christ and\nguarded them from the wolves Arius, and Macedonius, and Sabelius.  In the sixth year of\nthe archiepiscopate of this saint the Emperor Theodosius the Great [began to] reign over\nthe Christian people.   In that year also took place the General Council whereat One\nhundred and Fifty bishops gathered together in the city of Constantinople on account of\nMacedonius, who had denied the Holy Spirit; and this father was president of the Council. \nNow Saint Damalius, Archbishop of the city of Rome, did not come to the Council\nbecause of his illness, but he sent priests in his place.   And this holy father Timothy\ndisputed with Macedonius, who denied the Holy Ghost, and with Sabelius and with\nApollinarius, and he overcame them, and put them to shame.   And behold, we have\ndescribed their denial, and how this saint disputed with them, [in the section of this work]\nrelating to the days of the assembling of this Council, which is the first day of the month\nof Yekatit.  And during the archiepiscopate of this saint, he took great care concerning the\nbuildings of the churches, and he built many churches in the city of Alexandria and outside\nit, and he repaired and restored many of them; and he built many cells for the churches (?),\nand for the pilgrims.  And he was teaching his flock much doctrine continually, and by\nmeans of his great knowledge he strengthened them in the True Faith, and by the\nsweetness of his voice and his reading.  And he converted many of the followers of Arius\nand Macedonius, and brought them into the True Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And he\nsat upon the throne of Mark the evangelist for nine years and a half, and he died in peace. \nSalutation to Timothy the archbishop, brother of Peter the archbishop.\nAnd on this day also died Abba Selama, the Revealer of the Light, the Bishop of Ethiopia;\nnow his history is as follows:  A certain man from the country of the Greeks, a master of\nlearning, whose name was Merpes, came wishing to see the country of Ethiopia, and he\nhad with him two youths of his family, and the name of one was Fremnatos (Frumentius),\nand that of the other was “Adesyos (Aedesius)”; now there are some who call him\n“Sidrakos.”  And he arrived in a ship at the shore of the Sea of Ethiopia, and he saw all the\nbeautiful things, which his heart desired, and as he was wishing to return to his country,\nenemies rose up against him and killed him, and all those who were with him.  And these\n\ntwo youths were left [alive], and the men of the city made them captives, and taught them\nthe work of war, and took them as a present to the King of ‘Aksum whose name was\n“Alameda.”  And the king made Adyos director of his household, and Fremnatos, keeper\nof the Laws and Archives of “Aksum; and after a few days the king died, and left a little\nson with his mother, and the ‘Azgaga reigned with him.  And ‘Adesyos and Fremnatos\nbrought up the children, and taught them little by little the Faith of Christ, and they built\nfor them a place of prayer, and they gathered together to it the children and they taught\nthem psalms and hymns.   And when they had brought the boy to the stage of early\nmanhood, they asked him to dismiss them to their native country; and Adyoses departed to\nthe country of Tyre to see his kinsfolk, and Fremnatos departed to Alexandria, to the\nArchbishop Athanasius, and he found that he had been restored to his office.   And he\nrelated everything, which had happened unto him because of their Faith in the country of\nEthiopia, and how the people believed on Christ, but had neither bishops nor priests.  And\nthen Abba Athanasius appointed Fremnatos Bishop of the country of Ethiopia, and sent\nhim away with great honor.  And he arrived in the country of Ethiopia during the reign of\n‘Abreha and ‘Asbeha, and he preached the peace of Christ in all the regions thereof, and\nbecause of this he was called “Abba Selama.”   And after he had saluted the men of\nEthiopia he died in peace.  Salutation, salutation, I say, with joyful voice to Abba Selama.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated the blessed Saint Abba Roys.\nSalutation to Samuel and Zacharias.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and after a few\ndays they produced two children, a boy and a girl, and they called their names John and\nMary.  And then Andronicus and Athanasia took counsel together, and agreed to cease to\nlive together as man and wife, and they began to devote their money and themselves to\nministering to the sick and needy, that is to say, he ministered to the men, and she\nministered to the women; and they continued to do this for twelve years.  And then their\nchildren fell ill of the plague, and they both died on one day.  And when Andronicus saw\n[this] he fell upon the ground, and he cast himself before the picture of our Lord Jesus\nChrist, and wept, saying, “Naked was I when I came forth from my mother’s womb, and\nnaked shall I be when I go to God; God gave, God took away, blessed be the Name of God\nfor ever.”   And their mother, in the intensity of her grief, wanted to kill herself, and\nweeping she came into the sanctuary to the place where her children were buried.  And\nduring the night she saw, as it were, a monk who said unto her, “Weep not for the death of\nthy children, but weep for thyself, for thy children are rejoicing in the kingdom of the\nheavens.”  And when she heard this she went and told her husband, and they decided to\nrenounce the world.  And they distributed their money among the poor and needy, and\nwent forth by night, and came to Alexandria, and Andronicus left his wife there and\ndeparted to the desert of Scete, and became a monk with Abba Daniel; then he went back\nand took his wife to Upper Egypt, and placed her in a house of virgins and left her there. \nAnd when Andronicus had lived with Abba Daniel for twelve years, he asked that he might\ngo to Jerusalem so that he might be blessed in the holy places.  And whilst he was on the\nroad thither, behold, by the Will of God, his wife met him, for she also wished to receive a\nblessing in the holy places.  Now, by reason of her labor and vigil her face had become so\nchanged that he did not know her, but she knew him because his face had not changed. \nAnd having visited the holy places they returned to the city of Alexandria.   And Abba\nDaniel had knowledge by the Holy Spirit, and he said unto Andronicus, “Dwell in a place\nwith that monk who hath been thy companion, for he is holy”; and they dwelt [there]\ntwelve years, and there was none who knew that the companion of Andronicus was a\nwoman, but they called her “Athanasia.”  And Abba Daniel visited them on one occasion,\nand spoke to them concerning the profit of their souls.  And Athanasia having fallen sick,\nAndronicus went to Abba Daniel and said unto him, “My companion is going to die, come\nand visit him.”  When Abba Daniel arrived he found that she was very ill, and she said\nunto him, “Abba, I want thee to administer unto me the Offering.” and Abba Daniel\ndevoted himself to the matter, and administered unto her the Holy Mysteries, and she died\nstraightway; and there rose up a sweet odor and filled the place.  And when Andronicus\nwant to wrap her up for burial, he discovered by her hair that she was a woman; and they\nfound on the body a paper whereon her history was written, and a token which she left to\nher husband.  And when Andronicus had read the paper, and knew that she was his wife,\nhis mind became obscured, and he began to beat his face and to lament.  And after a few\ndays, now, he had become sick, the elders came and received his blessing, and having\nreceived the Offering, he died and entered into the kingdom of heaven.   Salutation to\nAndronicus.  Salutation to Athanasia.\nSalutation to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the elders of Israel.\nSalutation to Meskel Kibra.\nAnd on this day also died the blessed man, the fighter, and the worker of wonders, Abba\nPhilip, father of the Council of the holy city of Debre Libanos.  Of this holy man it was\n\nreported that he used to work signs and wonders.  And by the Will of God he came to his\nnative place in the interior of the desert, in the days when Abuna Takla Haymanot lived\nthere, to be his son, and that saint received him joyfully and he knew, by the spirit, that he\nwas to be a chosen vessel.  And after he had tried him with spiritual exercises of all kinds,\nhe arrayed him in the garb of the monk.   And Abba Philip fought the fight, and made\nhimself to be like unto Takla Haymanot.  And when Abba Takla Haymanot died, Philip\nwas set upon the throne of Abba Elisha.  After a little [time] one of the sons of the Abuna\ndied, and when they wanted to wrap him up in cloths for burial, he moved himself and\nspoke, saying, “Abuna Takla Haymanot, Elisha shall come to me, and Philip shall sit upon\nthy throne”; and having said this he died.  And then they appointed Philip to be the Abuna. \nAnd he followed a right course, like his father, and he received beatings and tribulations,\nas he ministered for righteousness’ sake; and he died under persecution (or, in exile), and\nhe departed to God, bearing the crown of praise.  Salutation to Philip.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and they came, by the commandment of the Emperor Constantine, to\nadminister the temples of the Orthodox.  And these saints rose up and came into the church\nand cast aside the bread which the wicked Arians, the deniers of Christ, had laid there, and\nthey said unto the people, “He who hath not been baptized in the Name of the Holy Trinity\nis only fit to offer up an offering on the altar of idols.”  And the Arians seized the saints\nand beat them very severely, and the soldiers threw them down upon the ground and\ntrampled upon them with their feet until their members and their bones were broken.  And\nthey delivered their souls into the hand of our Lord Jesus Christ and received the crown of\nmartyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  And certain believing men came, and they took\nthe bodies of the saints, and wrapped them up in cloths, and laid them in a fair place. \nSalutation to Mercurius and Ephraim.\nAnd on this day also took place the translation of the body of Abba Timothy, Archbishop\nof the city of Alexandria, from Mesr (Cairo) to the monastery of Abba Macarius in the\ndesert of Scete.\nAnd on this day also died the blessed Paul, the monk.  It is related of this renouncer of the\nworld that he enjoyed in this world honor and high rank, and that he had a wife, who was a\nsaint, and blessed children, and that he was exceedingly rich.  And he wanted to become a\nmonk.  And he called his wife and his children, and said unto them, “Behold, I want to sell\nyou for Christ’s sake”; and they said unto him, “Thou art our god, do what thou wishest.” \nAnd he took his wife, and his sons, and his possessions, and distributed all his money\namong the poor, and he came to a house for women, and he sought out the abbess and said\nunto her, “I want to sell thee this woman”; and she agreed to what he wanted.  And he\nwrote the bill of the sale, and handed her over to the abbess, together with what was with\nher; and she became a nun.  And he took his sons to another religious house, and he did\nwith them even as he had done with their mother, and he sold them to the archimandrite,\nand handed them over to him; and then he went to another religious house and sold\nhimself to the abbot.  And he said unto him, “I want to go into the church by myself,” and\nthe abbot gave him permission to do so.  And he went into the church, and shut the door,\nand he stood up and stretched out his hands towards heaven, and cried out with a loud\nvoice, saying, “O my Lord, Thou knowest that I have come unto Thee with all my heart.” \nAnd a voice came unto him, which said, “Behold, I know this, and I have accepted thee\nwith all My mind.”  And then he continued to perform all the hard work which had to be\ndone in the monastery, and he made himself the most menial of all the monks; but God\nexalted him because of his humility, and many miracles appeared through him, and he died\nin peace.  Salutation to Paul who sold his wife, and his children, and himself for the sake\nof Christ.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated the dedication of the church of Suriel the angel. \nSalutation to the dedication of thine house, which the believers built in Constantinople.\nAnd on this day Andrew the apostle performed many miracles, and some of them took\nplace when he was in the city of the Greeks.  And our Lord Jesus Christ appeared unto\nhim, saying, “Rise up and depart to Mathias (Matthew) in the Cannibal City, so that thou\n\nmayest bring him out of prison, for the men of that city will in three days bring him out to\neat him.”  And Andrew said unto our Lord, “If this will happen in three days I cannot get\nthere [in time to save him], therefore send an angel to bring him out of prison.”  And our\nLord answered and said unto Andrew, “Hearken.  If I say unto the city ‘Come to Me,’ it,\nand all those who dwell therein, shall come [to Me].  And as for thee and thy disciple,\nwhen the morrow cometh, rise up, and thou shalt find a ship which is ready to sail; embark\nin it, and it shall bring thee [thither].”  And He gave him the salutation “Peace” and went\nup into heaven in glory.  And Andrew rose up, as He had commanded him, and he came to\nthe seashore.  And God prepared for him a beautiful ship, and He stayed with him in the\nform of the captain, and there were two angels there in the forms of sailors.  And Andrew\nwent to the ship and found our Lord, Who was disguised as the captain thereof, and he said\nunto Him, “Peace be unto thee, O Captain”; and our Lord said unto him, “The peace of\nGod be with thee.”  And Andrew said unto Him, “Whither goest thou in this ship?”  And\nour Lord said unto him, “To the Cannibal City.”  And Andrew said unto Him, “Every man\nfleeth there from and do Ye travel thither?”   And the Captain said unto him, “It is\nnecessary for us to go thither”; and Andrew said unto Him, “I ask Thee to take me”; and\nthe Captain said unto him, “I agree,” and He made them to embark.  And as they were\ntraveling on the ship with our Lord as Captain, He asked Andrew many things, and\nAndrew told Him of many of the miracles of our Lord, not knowing that He was our Lord. \nAnd after this the Captain slept, and Andrew and his disciples slept, and at that moment\nour Lord commanded His angels to take up Andrew, and his two disciples, and to set them\ndown by the seashore.  And when Andrew woke up from his dream, and looked at the\nseashore, and did not find the ship, he marveled greatly; and he said unto his disciples, “O\nmy sons, we were in the ship with our Lord, and did not know it!”  And Andrew rose up\nand prayed, and our Lord appeared unto him coming out of the city in the form of a young\nman with a noble countenance (or, goodly person), and He said unto him, “Andrew, My\nbeloved, fear not!  I did this because thou didst say, ‘We cannot arrive at the city in three\ndays,’ and because I wished thee to know that I have power over everything, and that there\nis nothing too hard for Me [to do].  Rise up, come into the city, and bring out Matthew\nfrom prison, and all those who are with him.”  And having said these words He went up\ninto heaven with [great] glory.  And Andrew and his two disciples rose up, and came into\nthe city, and no one saw them.  When they came to the door of the prison house wherein\nwas Matthew, as soon as they touched the door it opened, and they went in and found\nMatthew sitting down singing; and Andrew embraced him.   And Andrew said unto\nMatthew, “Thou sayest that after two days they will take thee out, and slay thee like a\nbeast, and eat thy body; but thou hast forgotten those mysteries which we saw with our\nLord, and that when we spoke there, the heavens quaked.”  And Matthew said unto him,\n“Behold, I know this, O my brother, but I say that if it be the Will of our Lord, I shall come\nto an end in this city.  Hast thou not heard in the Holy Gospel the words, which say, ‘I send\nyou forth like sheep among wolves?’  But as for me, when they cast me into the prison\nhouse I cried unto God, and He revealed Himself unto me, and He said unto me, ‘Fear\nnot:  at the end of three days I will send unto you Andrew, and he shall bring thee out from\nthe prison house, thee and all those who are with thee.’   And behold thou hast come;\nconsider what thou wilt do.”  And Andrew looked at the men who were in the prison house\nand were fettered like beasts, and he began to speak and cursed Satan and all his hosts. \nAnd Andrew and Matthew made entreaty to God, and He heard their prayer, and they laid\ntheir hands on the men who were in the prison house, and they opened their eyes, and their\nsenses returned to them, and they commanded the apostles to go out from the city.  And\nAndrew and Matthew went out on the city road, and they sat down until they knew what\nwould happen.  And the men of the city came to the prison house to roast those who were\nbound therein, and to devour them according to their custom, and they found the gates of\nthe prison house open, and the prisoners not there.  And they said, “Woe be unto us!  What\nhath come upon us?”  And Satan took the form of a man and spoke unto the men of the\ncity, and the people ran with eagerness and seized Andrew and Matthew, and dragged them\nalong the road of the city, until their blood ran out of them like water, and then they cast\nthem into prison.  And the apostles prayed to God, and when they had finished their prayer\nthey drew nigh unto a pillar on which was an image, and they said unto it, “Be afraid of\nthe sign of the Cross which we make over thee, and pour out from beneath thee water in a\n\nvast quantity, like unto a flood, upon this city and upon all those who dwell therein.”  And\nthere sprang up from beneath it a vast quantity of water, which was exceedingly bitter and\nlike salt, and it threatened to sweep away the city, and all those who were in it.  And the\nmen of the city took up their children, and their parents, and wanted to flee there from, but\nthe pillar poured forth more and more water until it reached the necks of the people, and\nwas about to drown them.  And they wept, saying, “Woe be unto us!  This wrath hath come\nupon us because of the two excellent men who are servants of God; we will believe in\ntheir God.”  And Andrew said unto the pillar, “Hold, enough!  Behold, the time of the\nflood hath passed, and the time for sowing seed in the hearts of the men of this city hath\ncome.  It is the truth, which I speak unto thee.  When I have built a church in this city, I\nwill set thee in it, and they shall decorate thee”; and the water which was flowing from\nunder the image stood (i.e. ceased).  And when the men of the city saw that the water had\nstopped, they went to the apostles and walked with them, and the water receded before\nthem.  And the apostles stretched out their hands, and prayed to God, and the earth opened\nand swallowed up the men who were in the habit of slaying people; and when the\nmultitude saw this they were afraid.   And the apostles said unto them, “Fear not, but\nbelieve in God, we will not forsake you until we have given you life.”  And the apostles\nprayed again, and they raised from the dead those who had died in the water, and those\nwhom the earth had swallowed up, and they baptized in that water all the men of the city,\nin the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.  And they administered\nunto them the Holy Mysteries, and built them a church, and said unto them, “Observe the\ncommandments which we give you until the end of your days, and teach them unto you\nchildren who shall come after you, and entreat God to remove from you the laxity which is\ncaused by eating the flesh of men, and to give you understanding so that ye may eat the\nfood of men.”  And the apostles performed many miracles and wonders, and they healed\nmany sick folk, and then departed from that city.  And Andrew departed to the country of\nthe Greeks with his two disciples.  Salutation to Andrew and Matthew.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and his days were fifteen years.  And George loved the Church.  Now Armenius\nhad an only daughter, and [one day] she went out with her friends to divert herself, and\nshe found a monastery outside the city of Alexandria wherein monks were gathered\ntogether, and they were singing sweet hymns.  And the sound of their hymns and their\npraises came and penetrated the heart of the maiden, and she began to ask George, the\nson of her father’s sister, to tell her the meaning of the words of the hymns which the\nmonks were singing.  And as he was explaining to her the meaning of the hymns and\nmaking her to understand them, he told her of the punishment which would come upon\nsinners, and of the peace and joy which would come upon the righteous and the\nvirtuous.  When she returned to her father Armenius she confessed our Lord Jesus Christ\nbefore him.  And Armenius began to persuade her, and he said unto her, “O my daughter,\ndo not this thing”; but she would neither listen to his words nor obey him; and he\ncommanded the soldiers to cut off her head, and they cut it off with the sword, and she\nreceived the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  And certain men told\nthe governor, saying, “It is George, thy sister’s son, who hath led astray thy daughter.” \nAnd the governor seized Saint George, and after he had tortured him very severely he\nsent him to the city of ‘Ensena, where they tortured him very severely, and afterwards\ncut off his holy head with a sword; and George received the crown of martyrdom in the\nkingdom of the heavens.   Now there was there a certain deacon whose name was\nSamuel, and he took his holy body and carried it to the city of Manuf.  And when the\nwife of Armenius, the brother of the mother of Saint George, knew that George had\nbecome a martyr, she sent and took his body and placed it with the body of her daughter\nin the city of Alexandria.  Salutation to George.\nOn this day also the holy man Abba Nahrew became a martyr.  This holy man [came]\nfrom the district of the Fayyum in the country of Egypt, and he feared God exceedingly. \nAnd when he heard the stories about the martyrs, he went to the city of Alexandria, and\nwished to die for the sake of the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And [our Lord] said\nunto him in a vision, “Needs must that thou go and die in the city of Antioch.”  And he\npondered in his heart and said, “How can I possibly get there?”  And he sought out a\nship in which he could embark.  And God sent unto him the angel Michael who carried\nhim on his wings from the city of Alexandria, and brought him to the city of Antioch,\nand set him down near Diocletian; and Nahrew confessed the Living God.   And the\nemperor asked him his name, and the name of his city, and Nahrew told him that he was\nfrom the country of Egypt, and the emperor wondered about [the manner of] his\ncoming.  And the emperor tried to persuade him [to deny Christ], and he promised him\nthat he would give him much money, and costly raiment, if he would submit to him and\noffer sacrifice to his idols, but he would not hearken to what he said unto him.  And the\nemperor spoke a second time, saying, “I will torture thee with very severe tortures,” but\nNahrew was neither afraid of him nor did he obey his command.   And the emperor\ncommanded his soldiers to torture him with many different kinds of tortures.  On the\nfirst occasion he drove savage lions to attack him, on the second he burnt him in the fire,\n\non the third he tortured him on the wheel, and on the fourth he boiled him in a large\ncauldron.  When the emperor was tired to torturing him he commanded his soldiers to\ncut off his head, and they cut it off and he received the crown of martyrdom in the\nkingdom of the heavens.  And it came to pass that instead of being martyred in the city\nof Antioch, all the martyrs who ought to have been martyred in the city of Antioch, were\nmartyred in the land of Egypt; and similarly this holy man Abba Nahrew, who was from\nthe country of Egypt, and should have been martyred in Egypt, received the crown of\nmartyrdom in Antioch.  At that time Saint Julian dwelt in Antioch, and he took the body\nof Nahrew the martyr and sent it away in charge of two of his servants to his country\nwith great honor. Salutation to the man who was borne on the wings of Michael.\nAnd on this day also died Abba Minas, Bishop of the city of Tamai.  This holy man was\nfrom the city of Gamnudi and he was the only child of his father.  His parents were God-\nfearing folk, and they labored in the works of the monks in respect of their fasts, and\nprayers, and their devotion to the ascetic life, and their fighting, and at length the report\nof them was heard by all men, and by all the fathers.  And they made their son to marry\na wife against his will.  And when the bridegroom came into his marriage-chamber with\nthe maiden who called herself his wife, he made an agreement with her that they were to\nkeep their bodies pure and that they were not to pollute them and their virginity; and\nthey fought a great fight.  Then Saint Minas wanted to assume the garb of the monk, and\nhe said unto his wife, “It is undesirable for us to do the works of the ascetic life whilst\nwe are still living in the world.”  Now they used to wear sackcloth made of hair beneath\ntheir apparel, and they used to stand up all night long keeping vigil, and praying, and\nreading the Books of God.  After this she embraced him and bade him farewell, and he\ndeparted to the monastery of Abba Anthony, wishing, by so doing, to be far away from\nhis parents, for they were seeking him everywhere, and they had with them an order\nfrom the emperor bidding him to return to his wife; but God protected him and they did\nnot find him at all.  And Saint Minas dwelt in the monastery of Anthony for many days,\nand he devoted himself to ascetic labors and fought strenuously.  Now there was there\nwith him living like a monk Abba Michael, Archbishop of the city of Alexandria.  After\nthis he left the monastery of Saint Abba Anthony, and he departed to the monastery of\nSaint Abba Macarius of Scete.  In their days lived the two bright stars, Abba Abraham\nand Abba Ga’argi, and Saint Abba Minas was a beloved son unto them, and he dwelt\nwith them in their cell.  And he multiplied his labors in the angelic toil of the ascetic life,\nand he learned their doctrine, and the way in which they fought, and in his fighting and\npiety he excelled many of the fathers, and Abba Abraham and Abba Ga’argi, and other\nfathers marveled at him.  And Satan was jealous of him, and he beat him with a great\nbeating internally, and he lay prostrate on the ground for two months; but after this our\nLord Jesus Christ raised him up whole and unharmed, and he roared like a lion against\nSatan.  After this our Lord Jesus Christ summoned him to become a bishop, and the\nenvoys of the archbishop came to him; and he was exceedingly sorrowful and he wept\nbecause of his separation from the desert of Scete.  And the holy fathers said unto him,\n“Be not sorrowful, for this is from God”; and he bowed to the Will of God, and he\ndeparted with the envoys of the archbishop, and the archbishop made him Bishop of the\ncity of Tamai.  Now God gave him the gift of healing the sick, and all those who were\nsick used to come to him, and he would pray to God for them and they were healed\nstraightway.  And God also gave him gift of the knowledge of hidden things, and he\nknew what was in the minds of men.  All the bishops whose sees were in the districts\nnear him used to come to him from all parts, and take counsel with him, and accept his\nadvice, and bow to his decision; and the laity also used to come to him from all parts of\nthe country to hear his wise doctrine.  He was the father of four archbishops, and he laid\nhis hand upon them when they were enthroned; now these were, Iskander, and Cosmas,\nand Theodore, and Michael, Archbishop of the city of Alexandria.   When our Lord\nChrist wished him to depart from this transitory world this father knew by the Holy\nSpirit that day of his departure.  And he sent messengers and they brought all the people\nwho were in his diocese, and he commanded them to be strong in the Orthodox Faith,\nand to keep the precepts of the Holy Gospel.  Then he committed them to their True\nShepherd, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Whom he loved.  And all the people wept\n\nand mourned the departure from them of their good shepherd and father who protected\nthem upon earth in the place of God, and they buried him in a fitting manner, and laid\nhim in the place where he had directed he should be laid.  Salutation to Minas, Bishop of\nthe city of Tamai.\nAnd on this day also was consecrated the church of the holy and honorable, the great\none among martyrs, George of the city of Lydda.  And God wrought therein signs and\ngreat wonders which made the hearts of men to rejoice, and at length the history [of the\nholy man] and his wonderful acts were heard on sea and on land.  When the Emperor\nDiocletian, the infidel, heard the report of the church of Saint George, and the signs and\ngreat wonders which took place therein, he sent a captain whose name was Eukheius\ntogether with a large company of soldiers to destroy the church.  And that captain came\nthere with arrogance, and he went up into the tower wherein was the image (or picture)\nof Saint George, and he began to scoff at the church, and at Saint George.  And he had a\nstaff in his hand, and he struck with it the lamp which was burning before the picture (or\nimage) of Saint George, and he broke it, and straightway a fragment of the glass fell\nfrom it and dropped on the head of the infidel without his knowledge.  And fear and\ngreat trembling fell upon him, and his head became filled with fever, and he fell and lay\nprostrate on the ground.  And his companions took him up to carry him to their own\ncountry, for they knew well that all this which had come upon him was caused by Saint\nGeorge the mighty and victorious martyr; and whilst they were carrying him on the road\nthat captain died in disgrace and misery, and the soldiers took him up and cast him into\nthe sea.  When Diocletian, the infidel emperor, heard this thing he was furiously angry,\nand he determined in his heart to go himself and destroy the church of Mar Saint\nGeorge; but God bore no longer with him, and He smote him swiftly and made his eyes\nblind.  And the men in the palace rose up against him, and God removed him from his\nkingdom, and made the righteous man Constantine emperor; and he opened the churches\nand closed the houses of idols, and all the ends of the world rejoiced.  And the churches\nrejoiced, and the church of the holy and honorable star of the morning, George, rejoiced\nand was exceedingly glad.  Salutation to George the Martyr.\nAnd on this day also Saints Zenobius and his mother Zenobia became martyrs.  These\nsaints were from the city of Tabais, and they were elders therein, and certain men\naccused them of being Christians before the emperor.  And the emperor commanded his\nsoldiers to bring them to him, and [when they had done so] he said unto them, “What is\nthe object of your worship, and where is your country?”  And they said unto him, “We\nbelieve in Christ, and our city is Tabais.”  And the emperor said unto them, “Sacrifice ye\nto the gods”; and the saints said unto him, “We sacrifice to our God Jesus Christ and not\nto devils.”  And the emperor was wroth with them, and he commanded his soldiers to\nstrip off their apparel, and to hang them up by the hair of their heads, and to beat them\nwith rods; and the saints prayed to God, and straightway their fetters were unloosed. \nAnd the people saw the saints putting on garments of light, and the governor carrying\nhis throne and following them, and when they saw this they cried out, saying, “Holy,\nHoly, Holy, God of Hosts, our Lord Jesus Christ.”  And the governor marveled and said,\n“The God of the Christians is great.”  Then the governor was wroth and he commanded\nhis soldiers to hang them up on two crosses, so that each could see the other, [and they\ndid so,] and straightway a cloud came from heaven, and enveloped them, and gave them\nmanna.  On the following day the governor found them teaching the word of God, and\nwhen the people saw them they cried out with one voice, saying, “We believe that the\nGod of the Christians is great.”  And the governor also commanded his soldiers to make\ntwo seats and to fasten in them in an upright position two-iron stakes, and to cast them\ninto a red-hot oven; but God delivered them, and the governor found them teaching the\npeople as they were sitting upon those seats.  When the governor saw this he was filled\nwith fury, and he commanded his servants to dig a pit twenty cubits deep, and twenty\ncubits broad, and to light a fire therein and to cast them into it; but when the saints\nprayed to God the fire was extinguished, and every part of the pit became like a place\nswept and garnished.  And the governor called the keeper of the bath, who was carrying\na vessel full of water.  When the people saw this sign they gave thanks unto God, saying,\n\n“A miracle [worked by] God for His saints.”  When the governor failed to make them\nsubmit, he commanded his soldiers to slay them, and to take care of their bodies until\nthe following day so that they might burn them with fire and scatter their ashes to the\nwinds.  And when they killed them there were crashes of thunder, and lightning, and\ntorrents of rain, and there died through that thunderstorm fifty-four men.  During the\nnight the believers stole the bodies of the saints and buried them, and on the following\nday when the governor searched for their bodies, everyone told him that a miracle had\ntaken place; and the governor believed and became a Christian.  Salutation to Zenobia\nand to her first-born son Zenobius.\nSalutation to the multitude of martyrs who suffered with Zenobius and Zenobia whilst\nthe heavens thundered and lightened.\nAnd on this day also died Saint Mercurius and his brother John.  These saints were the\nchildren of Christian and God-fearing folk, and the name of the elder of them was\nShanay, but when he adopted the garb of the monk they called him “Mercurius.”  The\nname of the younger was Abu Farz, and him, when he adopted the garb of a monk, they\ncalled “John.”  When these saints arrived at man’s estate they departed to the monastery\nof Saint Theodore the general, and they dwelt [there] under the direction of a righteous\nold man who served God.  And they obeyed him and did work of every kind, and they\nministered to the work of the brethren, and they did whatsoever was required in the\nmonastery, and they endured the cold of winter and the days of summer, and they used\nto gather in very many of the fruits of the earth, and take them to the monastery.  They\nacquired no possessions whatsoever in the world, and they were remote from all the\nappetites of the world for meat, and drink, and riches; and they used to fast two and\nthree days at a time.   And they also learned to read and to write Coptic and Arabic\nwithout a teacher, and they fulfilled all the demands of the Rule of the ascetic life. \nWhilst they were living thus one day the angel of the Lord came and told them that they\nwould attain to the fight of martyrdom; and then they became strong by the Holy Spirit,\nand they rose up in glad haste and rejoiced.  Then they came into their own city, where\naccusations against them were made to the governor of the city, and he had them taken\nto the governor of Behnesa.   And that governor asked them questions and said unto\nthem, “Is it true that ye are idolaters?”   And the saints said unto him, “We confess\nopenly that we are Christians, and we have no other God except Jesus Christ.”  When\nthe governor heard this he was filled with wrath, and he ordered his soldiers to throw\nchains about their necks and to march them round about the whole city; [and they did\nso,] and then they shut them up in the prison house.  Whilst they were there the angel of\nthe Lord visited them many times, and when they had been in prison five months the\ngovernor had them brought out and set before him, and he said unto them, “Abandon\nyour Faith”; and they refused.  And the governor [tried to] frighten them and said unto\nthem, “I will burn your bodies,” but they were not frightened by his words, and when the\ngovernor saw the firmness of their minds, he sent them back into prison.  After many\ndays there came another governor, and he wished to save them and to set them at liberty,\nand straightway certain men reviled him and said unto him, “If thou dost not kill them\nwe will accuse thee to the emperor.”  So against his will he commanded his soldiers to\nlight a fire, and they were summoned to come, but he only did this to frighten them for\nhe wanted to imprison them, and then he cast them into the prison house.   And he\ncommanded his soldiers to bring them out again, and to frighten them with fierce\nswords, but the hearts of the holy men did not quail, and they were unable to alter their\nwords.  Then, fearing the people, the governor commanded his soldiers to cut off their\nheads.  They cut off the head of John first, and his head leaped up from his body, and\nthere went forth from it a voice like unto a shout of joy, and it was so loud that all the\npeople who heard it wondered; then they cut off the head of Saint Mercurius, and thus\nthey finished their holy martyrdom.   And they cast their bodies in the fire, and\nstraightway the fire was extinguished, and it did not touch their bodies, and their raiment\nwas not scorched.  When the governor saw this he commanded them to keep guard over\ntheir bodies so that the Christians might not steal them.  And on the following day when\nthey looked they found a fountain of water under the place where they had cast their\n\nbodies, and afterwards many signs and miracles were made manifest through it. \nSalutation to Mercurius, whose body the fire would not burn.  Salutation to John, from\nwhose head after it had been cut off a voice was heard.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

the first had the likeness of\nthe face of a lion, the second had the likeness of the face of a bull, the third had the\nlikeness of the face of a man, and the fourth had the likeness of the face of an eagle; and\neach of them had six wings.  And they cried out by day and by night, saying, “Holy,\nHoly, Holy, God of Hosts.  All the heavens and the earth are filled with the holiness of\nThy glory” (Rev. iv, 6).   And Isaiah the prophet also said, “I saw the Lord of Hosts\nsitting upon a high throne, and the whole place was filled with His glory.  Seraphim and\nCherubim surrounded Him, and His awe and majesty were exceedingly great.  Each of\nthese had six wings; with two of their wings they covered their faces, with two of their\nwings they covered their feet, and with two of their wings they did fly in the greatest\nglory by day and by night, saying, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hosts.   All the\nheavens and the earth are filled with the holiness of Thy glory” (Isaiah vi, 2).   And\nDavid the prophet said, “He rode upon the Cherubim and did fly” (Psalm xviii, 10), and\nhe also said, “He Who sitteth upon the Cherubim maketh the earth to quake,” And\nEzekiel said concerning these wheels, “I saw a wind blow from heaven, and in it there\nwas a cloud surrounded by fire, and brightness, and lightning, and four beasts supported\nHim.  Each face (or person) had six wings, and they went before them.  And the first\nbeast had the likeness of the face of a man, and they ceased not to praise God by day and\nby night, and they said, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hosts, all the heavens and the\nearth are filled with the holiness of Thy glory” (Ezekiel I).  And John the evangelist said,\n“I heard a voice saying, Hallelujah!  Salvation and power and blessing to our God.  And\nthe four beasts and the four and twenty elders of heaven worshipped God, saying,\nHallelujah!  God the Sustainer of the universe is King (Rev. xix, 4).  After this I heard a\nvoice saying, Praise our God with harp and psalms, Hallelujah!  And I heard the voice of\na multitude of peoples like unto the thunder, saying, God, the Sustainer of the universe,\nis King.”  And many of the Books of the Old and the New Testaments testify concerning\nthe honor of these Four Beasts which God hath set near Him to make supplication on\nbehalf of all creation.  He with the man’s form maketh supplication on behalf of the\nchildren of men, he with the lion’s form maketh supplication on behalf of the beasts, he\nwith the bull’s form maketh supplication on behalf of the cattle, and he with the eagle’s\nform maketh supplication on behalf of the birds.  Now these beasts are very much nearer\nGod than all the other powers of heaven.  For this reason the doctors of the Church have\nconfirmed the commemoration of them, and have built churches to them in every place,\neven as at this day, because they make supplication for the race of man.  Salutation to\nthe Four Beasts and to the horses of the Cherubim.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated the festival of Afnin the Archangel, one of the\nnine and ninety archangels, who together with Surafel guard the throne of glory.  Of him\nEnoch said that he goeth round that house;

if we take him by the help of\nGod we will kill the calumniator.”  And this holy man continued to fast for a week at a\ntime, and he ate nothing except bitter lupines.  In those days a wild beast of the desert\nravaged the [lands of the] monastery and killed all the cattle of the monks.  And Abba\nKefrenya (Copronius) went to him, and laid hold of him by his ear like a sheep, and tied\nhim up with a cord, and he lived [there] twelve years and died.  And Saint Kefrenya\n(Copronius) went to Jerusalem, led by an angel of God, and he arrived there in one\nnight; and he saw their great mysteries and was blessed by the holy places, and he\nreturned to his habitation and died in peace.  Salutation to Kefrenya (Copronius), the son\nof a pagan, who bound in fetters a wild beast that slew the cattle.\nAnd on this day also four hundred and eighty-four souls who belonged to the company\nof Isidore became martyrs.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

He said: “The Son is a created being in all His Person.”   These saints were\nhonorable fathers and fighters, and some of them had, like the apostles, raised the dead,\n\nand healed the sick, and worked great signs and wonders.  Some of them had suffered\ntortures for the sake of the Orthodox Faith of Christ, some of them had suffered torture\nand had their eyes dug out; of some of them the torturers had cut off their hands and\ntheir feet, of some the torturers had smashed their teeth, and of some they had torn out\nthe nails and scraped their bodies.  Among those who had suffered tortures there was a\ncertain bishop of the city of Mar’ash whose name was Thomas.  Him certain vile and\nevil men cast into prison for two (?) years, where they tortured him mercilessly.  Each\nyear they had cut off from him one of his limbs, and they had cut off his hands and his\nfeet, and smashed his teeth, both those in front and those in the sides of his jaws, and his\nnose and lips had been cut off, and his body was as black as the ashes of a fire.  Many\npeople thought that he was dead, and had performed memorial services for him as for\nthe martyrs and apostles.  When these fathers and bishops arrived in the city of Nicea,\nConstantine the emperor prepared for them a large and spacious hall, and he placed\ntherein thrones whereon the holy fathers and bishops could sit, and he set therein his\nown throne, which was smaller than [any one] of theirs.  And he began with Thomas,\nBishop of the city of Mar’ash, and he bowed low before him, and embraced every part\nof him, including the [places of] the members which had been cut off his body.  Then he\ngave to the fathers and bishops his royal scepter, and his sword, and his ring, and he said\nunto them, “Behold, I have this day given you power over the priesthood and over the\nkingdom.   According to what ye wish let [every man] remain, provided that he is\nOrthodox; he who is not Orthodox separate from your flock; and ye shall formulate the\nCanon and the Law.”  And our Lord Jesus Christ tarried among them, and there were\nmany [of them] whose hearts were illumined by the Holy Spirit.   And certain men\ncounted the thrones whereon sitters were seated and they found them to be in number\nthree hundred and nineteen, and they counted the fathers and bishops and found them to\nbe in number three hundred and eighteen.  And they formulated a Canon for the priests,\nand for the laity, and for the emperors, and for the countries, and for pilgrims, and for\nthose who sold, and for those who bought, and they made ordinances for every matter. \nThen they proclaimed the Orthodox Faith, and they made known that the Son was the\nequal of the Father in Godhead, and they excommunicated Arius and him that believed\nin his filthy belief.   This is the Orthodox Faith, which they formulated, saying, “We\nbelieve in One God, the Lord, the Father, the Sustainer of Creation, Maker of heaven\nand of earth, and of all things visible and invisible.  And we believe in One Lord Jesus\nChrist, the Only Son of the Father, Whose being was with Him before the world was\ncreated, Light Who proceedeth from Light, God Who proceedeth from God in truth,\nWho was begotten and not made, Who is equal with the Father in Godhead, in Whom is\neverything that is, and without Whom there would be nothing whatsoever which is in\nheaven and upon earth, Who for the sake of us men and for our salvation came down\nfrom heaven, and was made man by the Holy Ghost of Mariyam, the holy Virgin.  He\nbecame man, and was crucified for our sakes in the days of Pontius Pilate.He suffred\nand died and was buried and rose from the dead on the third day, as it is written in the\nHoly Scriptures.  He ascended in glory into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of\nHis Father.  He shall come again in glory.  He shall judge the living and the dead, and\nthere shall be no end to His kingdom.”  After this, when one hundred and fifty bishops\nwere assembled in the city of Constantinia, they formulated the remainder of the\nOrthodox Faith, saying, “And we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord the Vivifier, Who\nsprang from the Father.  We worship Him and we praise Him, with the Father and the\nSon, Who spoke by the prophets”--to the end of the [words of] the Faith (i.e. And we\nbelieve in One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church.  And we believe in one Baptism\nfor the remission of sin and wait for the resurrection from the dead.   Life to come. \nWorld without end.   Amen.).   And they excommunicated anyone who should add\nanything to it or take anything away from it.  And they commanded that every priest\nshould recite it, and all the laity, both old and young, men and women, slaves and\nhandmaidens.  And they were to recite it at the time of at the night prayer, and at the\ntime of the day prayer, and at the time of the consecration of the Offering, and they were\nto teach it to all the people.  And the fathers and bishops made ordinances of every kind\nfor the Church and the Orthodox Faith.  They established the light of the Faith and then\nthey departed to their own countries.\n\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and Dorotheus did as the angel commanded him.  And\nhe summoned all the people according to his custom, and he made a feast in honor of the\nangel Michael.  When he had gone into his store-chamber to see if, peradventure, he\ncould find a jar of wine for the Offering, he found the interior of his chamber filled with\nwine, and much flour; and Dorotheus was frightened and he marveled exceedingly. \nWhen he had ministered unto all the company, and they had finished the feast, and all\nthe people had departed to their houses, the honored angel appeared unto the blessed\nDorotheus in the garb wherein he had appeared unto him before, and commanded him to\ncut open the belly of the fish.  When he had cut open the belly of the fish he found\ntherein three hundred dinars of gold, and three third parts of a dinar.  And the archangel\nMichael said unto Dorotheus and his wife, “Set aside these three third parts of a dinar\nfor the sheep, the fish, and the flour, and these three hundred dinars shall be for your\nown needs.  God hath remembered you and the alms and oblations which ye have been\nwont to make, and hath rewarded you for the same here in this world, and at the last day\nHe will make you to inherit the kingdom of heaven.”  And as they were frightened at\nthis matter he said unto them, “I am Michael the archangel who hath delivered you from\nall your tribulation, and it is I who have loved your alms and oblations, and have taken\nthem up to God.  Henceforward ye shall lack no good thing whatsoever in this world.” \nAnd they prostrated themselves before him, and he disappeared and went up into\nheaven.  And the angel Michael worked so many miracles that they are innumerable. \nSalutation to thee, O merciful angel Michael whom I have feared from my youth up;\nhide me under thy prayers at dawn and at eve.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Philotheus, the sixty-third Archbishop of the\ncity of Alexandria.  In the days of his archiepiscopate the King of Ethiopia sent a letter\n\nto George, King of Noba, and he said unto him:  “God is wroth with us because of what\nthe kings who were before us have done.  For they transgressed the commandment of\nGod, concerning Abba Peter, the bishop, whom they drove out of his diocese, and they\nappointed in his stead Minas the liar, in the days of Cosmas the archbishop; and, behold,\nsix archbishops have [not] appointed a bishop to our country.  And because of this our\ncountry is destroyed, and all our men and beasts have perished through famine and\nplague.  Our enemies have risen up against us and have carried away captive many men\nfrom our country and have plundered our cities.  The rain hath been withheld and it falls\nnot, and the earth will not give her fruit, and our enemies have burnt our cities, and\nplundered the churches, and driven us from place to place.   I beseech thee to show\nfriendship to me in this trouble, for God’s sake, and for the sake of the Orthodox Faith. \nAnd do thou write a letter to our father the Archbishop Abba Philotheus of Egypt, and\nentreat him for God’s sake to absolve us, and to open up our country, and to pray for us\nso that God may remove from us and from our country the tribulation and trial which\nhave come upon us, and may have compassion upon us and may appoint us a bishop,\nand may send him to us according to what was always done for our fathers, so that the\nbishop may pray to God on our behalf to remove His wrath from us.  And this which I\nam saying unto thee I say, O my brother king, because I fear [that if a bishop be not sent]\nthe Christian Faith will perish from among us.  And behold, from that time unto this day\nsix archbishops have been enthroned, and they have neither remembered our country nor\nappointed us a bishop.  And we have become like unto sheep which have been turned\nout, and have no shepherd.   Our bishops, and priests, and kings have died, and our\nchurches have been pulled down; but we acknowledge that this tribulation hath come\nupon us rightly in return for what we did to our Bishop Abba Peter.”  And when the\nletter of the King of Ethiopia came to King George in Noba, and he had read it, he was\nexceedingly sorry that trials and tribulation had come upon the country of Ethiopia.  And\nstraightway George, King of Noba, wrote a letter and sent it to Archbishop Abba\nPhilotheus, and in it described to him all the trials and tribulation which had come upon\nthe country of Ethiopia, and he besought him to have compassion upon the Christian\npeople of the country of Ethiopia and to appoint them a bishop.  When the archbishop\nheard this he sent straightway to the desert of Scete, to a certain righteous monk, and\nthat monk, whose name was Abba Daniel, came forthwith to him from the monastery of\nAbba Macarius, and he appointed him bishop of the Ethiopians and sent him to them. \nAnd when Abba Daniel arrived in Ethiopia the people received him with great honor,\nand he removed the wrath [of God] from them, and he made them to conquer their\nenemies who had rebelled against them in times past.  And all his work was right during\nthe days of this Archbishop, Abba Philotheus, and he made manifest many signs and\nwonders.  Salutation to Philotheus the apostle.\nSalutation to ‘Admas.  [Omitted in the Bodleian MS.]\n[On this day died Ba’eda Maryam I, King of Ethiopia, who died on Nov. 8, A.D. 1478.]\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

us on this day to make a feast in honor of the\nthousands of thousands of spirit beings who have no bodies, and who make intercessions\nfor all the world, and of whom Enoch speaks, saying, “I was in the waters, and the winds\nand the clouds carried me up and brought me into a house which was built with a tongue\nof fire, and I saw there thousands of thousands.”  And he also says, “I saw the children\nof the angels standing upon flames of fire and their apparel was as white as snow.”  And\nJacob says, “I saw in the mount of Bethel a ladder on the earth which reached even to\nthe heavens, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.”  And Jacob\nalso says, when he returned from Syria, “I saw hosts of angels.”   And Moses says,\n“Arrange the people each [tribe] on its own border, and the number of each was as the\nangels of God.”  And Moses also says, “God came from Sinai, He appeared unto me in\nSeir, and with Him were His angels.”  And David says, “Who makes His angels spirits,\nand those who minister unto Him a flame of fire.”  And he also says, “The chariots of\nGod are thousands, and the tens of thousands who rejoice.”  Elijah also saw the chariots\nof fire and the horses of fire surrounding him like a wall.  And Daniel says, “And the\nAncient of Days sat, and His apparel was as white as snow, and the hair of His head was\nas wool.  His throne was a blazing fire, and the wheels thereof were red-hot coals, and a\nriver of fire flowed out there from.  Thousands of thousands ministered unto Him, and\ntens of thousands stood before Him.”  And Luke says, “Suddenly there came with that\nangel multitudes of the hosts of heaven, and they praised God, saying, Glory [be] to God\nin the heavens, and peace upon earth, [and] His goodwill to the children of men.  Then\nthe angels passed from them, and went up into the heavens.”  And Matthew says, “And\nbehold, angels came and ministered unto Him.”  And he also says, “Then shall the Son\nof man come in His glory, and all His angels with Him.”  And John says in the words of\nJesus Christ, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye would see the heavens opening, and the\nangels of God ascending and descending to the Son of man.”  And Judah says, “Behold,\nGod shall come with His thousands of saints.”   And the heads of the Church have\nenumerated the various kinds of angels thus:   Angels, Archangels, Lords (Virtues),\nDominions, Powers, Thrones and Principalities.  Salutation to the tens of thousands of\ntens of thousands of angels and to the Cherubim and to the Seraphim.\nAnd on this day also died Saint ‘Askanafer, the chief of the thirteen thieves who became\nChristians of His Faith.  This ‘Askanafer was one of the nobles of Rome, and he gave\nalms to the poor and needy.  Now, in those days there was a gang of thirteen robbers\nwho destroyed the travelers whom they found on the road.  When they heard the story of\n‘Askanafer, and that he succored the monks, they went to him to kill him by an ambush,\nand to take his money.  Then they dressed themselves in the garb of monks, and stood by\nthe gate of his courtyard, and when ‘Askanafer saw them he thought that they were the\nTwelve Apostles, and that one of them was Christ.  And he bowed low before them, and\ntook them into his house, and he brought a table of food to them, and then he washed\ntheir feet, and he sprinkled the water on his son who was paralyzed, and had been ill for\nfive and thirty years, and he was healed immediately.  When the thieves saw this they\nwere greatly frightened.  And ‘Askanafer said unto them, “Tell me, O my fathers, which\nof you is Christ?  Show Him to me that I may worship Him.”  And when the men of the\ncity heard that the son of the nobleman was healed, they came to him, and they bowed\nlow before [the thieves], and they said unto them, “O saints of God, bless us and heal\nour sick folk.”  Then the thieves took out their daggers and gave them to the nobleman,\n[and their chief] said unto him, “Take these knives so that thou mayest kill us even as we\nwished to kill thee.”  And ‘Askanafer said unto them, “Ye say this that ye may abase\n\nyourselves.”  And they said unto him, “God would have trodden us in the dust if we\ncould not have boasted ourselves of thy prayer”; and after they had spoken thus they\nembraced him.  And each of them took a few lentils in a bag, and they departed [on a\njourney] of twenty-five days, and they sowed the lentils in the sand, and at the time of\nsunset they ate three (sic) lentils.   And they lived thus for thirty years, and then the\nArami (i.e., desert robbers) came and killed them.  Salutations to ‘Askanafer who raised\na paralytic from his couch and healed him.  Salutation also to the thieves who fought a\nfight for thirty years as the result of seeing this miracle.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Timothy, Bishop of the city of Ensena. \nThis holy man was righteous and chaste from his youth, and he fought a great fight in\nworking righteousness.  And the governor of the city seized him because of his faith in\nour Lord Jesus Christ, and because he taught His own True Faith to men, and he tortured\nhim with severe tortures for many days, and he shut him up in the prison house, and he\ntortured him continually during a period of three years.  And there were with him in the\nprison house many saints who were bound in fetters for the Faith.   And that infidel\ngovernor had them brought out of the prison house, and he tortured them, and he poured\nout their holy blood until at length only a very few prisoners remained in the prison\nhouse, and among these was this holy man Timothy.  At that time God blotted out the\nEmperor Diocletian, the infidel, and the God-loving Emperor Constantine reigned.  And\nan Edict came from him into every country ordering that those who were believers on\nChrist should be brought out of the prisons, and they brought out from the prison house\nthis holy man among those who were released.  And this holy man departed to his house,\nand he gathered together the monks and the priests who were in his diocese, and he\nmade a long prayer [which lasted] from evening to daybreak wherein he entreated God\nfor the salvation of the soul of that governor who had tortured him, and he prayed thus: \n“O Lord, have mercy upon that governor, for it is he who hath brought me great good,\nand who hath been the means of bringing me nigh unto Thee, O my Lord.  In the same\nmanner, O Lord, do Thou work upon him so that he may believe in Thee, and may come\nto Thee,”   And the people marveled at the simplicity (or innocence) of heart of this\nfather, and they told the governor, saying, “Abba Timothy is praying to God for thee that\nHe may have mercy upon thee, and may deliver thy soul.”  When the governor heard\nthis thing he marveled exceedingly, and he said, “I should have thought that he would\ncurse me rather because of the punishments which I have inflicted upon him, and he\nobtained from him knowledge of the Law of the Christians, and this father revealed to\nhim the causes of the Incarnation of the Son of God, and how the prophets spoke\nconcerning Him in the beginning, many years ago, and how their prophecies were\nfulfilled, and how the matter concerning Him is written in the Holy Gospel.  And the\ngovernor believed on our Lord and Redeemer Jesus Christ through this holy man, and he\nbaptized him with holy Christian Baptism.  And the governor forsook his office, and\nbecame a monk, and was numbered among the folk of this father.   And during the\nremainder of his days this father continued to teach his flock at all times, and to confirm\nthem in the Orthodox Faith, and he died in the peace of God.  Salutation to Timothy.\nAnd on this day died the holy father Zachariah, the sixty-fourth Archbishop of the city\nof Alexandria.  He was a native of the city of Alexandria, and was a priest therein, and\nhe was steward of all the property of the Church.  And he was chaste in his striving, and\na virgin in body, and gentle in disposition, and an old man in his days.   When\nArchbishop Philotheus died, the bishops assembled in order to elect with the counsel of\nGod the man who was fit for this office.  And as they were all gathered together in the\nchurch of Saint Mark, the evangelist and apostle, and discussing together who was the\nmost suitable man for this office, behold, they heard that a certain man had obtained\nfrom the emperor a letter by bribery, and that he had with him slaves and soldiers from\nthe emperor who were going to appoint him archbishop against the wishes of the\nbishops.  And the bishops were sorry that an archbishop should be appointed by bribery,\nand by the transgression of the Canon and commandment of the Apostles, and they\nprayed continually and entreated God, the Glorious and Most High, to appoint him\nwhom they had chosen.  And as they were praying to God behold this father came down\n\nthe stairs of the roof of the church, and he had in his hand a vessel of acid (vinegar ?),\nand as he was coming down his foot slipped, and he fell from the top of the roof-stairs to\nthe bottom.  And he lifted himself up still holding in his hand the vessel, which was\nunbroken, and the acid was unspilled.  When the bishops and the priests saw this they\nmarveled exceedingly.  And the people of the city of Alexandria enquired concerning\nthis holy man Abba Zachariah, and they talked about his virtues and his righteousness,\nand all the men of the city of Alexandria agreed with the bishops about the appointment\nof this holy man as archbishop, and they enthroned him.  And during the days of his rule\ngreat tribulation came upon him, and he sorrowed greatly through the King of Egypt,\nHakam, that is to say the governor.  In those days there came unto him a certain monk\nfrom the monastery of Abba Macarius, and he said unto him, “Make me a bishop.”  And\nAbba Zachariah said unto him, “Have patience, O my son, and do not transgress the\ncommand of the Canon of the Apostles, but return to thy monastery, and fight for the\nsalvation of thy soul, and God’s Will shall be done.”  When the monk heard these words\nhe became full of rage, and Satan entered into his heart, and he went to the King of\nEgypt, that is to say the governor, and made to him false accusations against Saint Abba\nZachariah.  And the king seized the holy man and shut him up in prison, and then he cast\nhim to the lions so that they might rend him, but the lions would not go near him at all. \nAnd the king was wroth with the keeper of the lions, and he thought that he had taken a\nbribe from the archbishop.  Then the king starved the lions, and took some of the blood\nof an ox and smeared the archbishop therewith, and threw him to the lions to eat; but\nthey would not go near him at all; and the king marveled at this thing, and he took the\narchbishop from among the lions.  Then he shut him up in prison for three months, and\nhe was always saying unto him, “If thou dost not forsake the Christian Faith, and if thou\ndost not enter my own faith, I will punish thee, and will kill thee with the sword, and\nwill cast thee again to the lions, and if I do not that I will cast thee into the fire.”  But\nSaint Abba Zachariah was strong in the True Faith, and he was not in any way afraid of\nhim.  Then the king made him many promises, and said unto him, “If thou wilt hearken\nunto my command, and wilt enter my faith, I will give thee much money, and I will\nappoint thee judge over every judge.”  But he did not listen to him in the least degree,\nand he did not turn aside from the least of the good works, which he was wont to do, and\nhe answered and said unto him, “If thou wert to give me all the kingdom of this world, I\nwould not forsake the True Faith.”  After this the king shut him up in prison for a few\ndays, and then he released him from the prison house.  And when Saint Zachariah came\nforth from the prison house he departed to the desert of Scete, and very many bishops\nwent with him through fear of the governor.  And in those days the king commanded [his\npeople] to destroy all the churches in the countries under his dominion.  And he made\nvery many Christians to forsake their Faith after he had tortured them with very severe\ntortures; and the Christian peoples lived in this state of tribulation of nine years, and\nduring this period of nine years [the Muslims] destroyed the churches.  At the end of\nnine years Christ had compassion on his people, and He turned away his wrath from\nthem, and He removed from them all this tribulation.   And the king, that is to say,\ngovernor, commanded [the Christians] to build churches everywhere in the countries\nunder his dominion, and he gave back to them all the goods and money which he had\ntaken from them, and the lands which were endowments of the Church; and all the\nchurches were built, or rebuilt and restored with more than their former splendor.  And\nthis father Abba Zachariah built many churches, and the king, that is to say, governor,\ncommanded the Christians to blow a trumpet in the churches, and to rejoice at their\ntimes of prayer and when they celebrated the Holy Eucharist.  And the Christians lived\nin great happiness under the right observance of the Law of the Church and of believers,\nand this father continued to build and to endow churches for twelve years.  One day a\nbishop whose name was Mercurius came to him, and his body was leprous.  And Abba\nZachariah said unto him gently and with kindliness of heart, “O my brother, Abba\nMercurius, I will help thee because of this disease which hath come upon thee.  And\nthou knowest that God said unto Moses, ‘Thou shalt accept the person of no man in\nrespect of right judgment.’  The priesthood is not fitting for thee whilst this disease is\nupon thee, unless God shall remove this disease from thee, for the Book calls it\nunclean.”  And Mercurius the bishop wept and said unto him, “O my father, help me by\n\nthy prayer”; and he went away from him, and departed and went into the church of our\nLady, the holy Virgin Mary, which was in his diocese, and he stood up before the picture\nof our Lady Mary, and he wept, and prayed and entreated and made supplication to her\nto cleanse him from this disease.  And he did this from the morning of the Second Day\nuntil the ninth hour of the Fourth Day of the week; he invoked [the Virgin] and he\nprayed by day and by night.  And at the ninth hour, being weary, he rested his head\nagainst the wall whereon was the image of our Lady Mary, and he saw the hand of the\nimage rubbing his body.  And he awoke straightway, and he found that his body was\ncleansed of the leprosy, and he rejoiced with a great joy; and he praised our Lord Jesus\nChrist, and gave thanks to our Lady, the holy Virgin Mary.  And straightway his disciple\ncame to him, and he said unto him, “Come, O my son, and look at my body, for behold\nour Lady Mary hath healed me of my disease by her prayers, and it befits me to stay in\nthis place for three days in order to thank my Lord Christ for the gracious gift which He\nhath bestowed upon me.”  Then he ate a little bread, and drank a little water, and he\nremained in that church until the beginning of the Sabbath.  Then he rose up and went to\nthe Archbishop Abba Zachariah when he was in the church on the First Day of the week\nand informed him of what had happened to him, and he said unto him, “It hath all\nhappened through thy prayer.”  And Saint Abba Zachariah answered and said unto him,\n“God hath looked upon thy pure heart and thy humility, and hath cleansed thee from thy\ndisease, and hath received thy prayer, and thy tears.   And now it is meet for thee to\nconsecrate the Holy Mysteries, and to administer them to us so that we may be blessed\nby the grace which thou hast received.”   And when the Holy Eucharist had been\nadministered, all those who were in the church were blessed thereby, and they marveled\nexceedingly at this miracle, and they glorified God the Worker of wonders.  On another\noccasion a certain deacon came to Saint Abba Zachariah the archbishop, and he bowed\ndown before him weeping abundantly, and he kissed his feet and said unto him, “Have\ncompassion upon me, O my lord, for I have gone astray and have fallen into sin, and\nstraightway all my body hath become leprous.”  And Abba Zachariah said unto him, “O\nmy son, art thou able to persevere in fasting before our Lord Jesus Christ?”  And the\ndeacon said unto him, “Yea, O my father, command me to do whatsoever thou wishes,\nand I will do (it).”  And straightway the archbishop brought him into a dark chamber, by\nhim, and he stood there and turned his face to the east, and he said unto the deacon, “O\nmy son, pray to God, and entreat Him with tears by day and by night without ceasing,\nand repent, and return not to [thy] sins.”  And after three days and three nights Abba\nZachariah gave him a little bread by measure and a little water, and Abba Zachariah ate\nand drank in the same manner.  And after fifteen days Abba Zachariah visited him and\nsaid unto him, “Be not afraid.”  And after one month was ended Abba Zachariah visited\nhim, and uncovered his body, and he saw that the leprosy was diminishing on his body;\nand he said unto him, “Be not afraid.”  And after four days he visited him again, and he\nfound that his body was free from leprosy, and he washed him with water and anointed\nhim with oil.  And he prayed over him and said unto him, “O my son, know thyself. \nBehold, thou art healed of thy disease; commit sin no more.”  And the archbishop sent\nhim away to his house rejoicing and praising God.  And God wrought very many signs\nand wonders by the hand of this Saint, Archbishop Abba Zachariah.  Now he [lived] in\nthe sixth hundred and ninety-first year of the Holy Martyrs (i.e. A.D. 975).  He sat as\narchbishop eight and twenty years; of that period he passed seven years in rest and\npeace, nine years in tribulation, and twelve years in joy and in building churches.  And\nhe departed to God and died in peace, and entered into the kingdom of heaven. \nSalutation to Abba Zachariah who succeeded Philotheus, and whom the lions refused to\neat.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Lestelia, and Mekrona, and Mariana, and\nPhilopator, and ‘Abrani, and the Emperor Honorius.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

he was an ascetic, and a fighter, and he was gentle and good.   He\npersecuted the followers of Arius continually, and he rebuked them, and cursed them,\nand called them “infidels”; because of this and through them a very great tribulation\ncame upon him.  And they used to lie in wait for him in the market places, and when he\npassed they seized him on many occasions, and punished him and beat him, and very\noften they dragged him about through the city by his feet.  And he fled from them to a\ncity, which was afar off, and he came to the shore of the Red Sea and he dwelt there in a\ncave for many years, and he lived upon what grew out of the ground.  And when the\nhistory of him was noised abroad, and his spiritual contending and his excellence, God\nchose him to be a bishop.  When he had been made Bishop of the country of Thrace, he\nadopted in his diocese the course of life which was followed by the Apostles, and he was\nsuperior to many men in love (or charity) and mercy, and God made manifest through\nhim many miracles.  Once when he was passing by he saw a dead man whom a wicked\nman had seized [for debt]; he was an obstinate and a stupid man by nature, and he would\nnot allow the kinsfolk of the dead to bury the body, saying, “He owes me four hundred\ndinars of gold, and they shall not bury him unless they give me this [sum of money].” \nAnd this holy man entreated him, and rebuked him seriously, and said unto him,\n“Release this dead body so that [his kinfolk] may bury him”; and the man would not\nhearken unto him.  And the holy man prayed and entreated God, and he raised up the\ndead man, and rebuked the man who had seized him, before the people, saying, “Why \ndost thou utter lies over him and hast no fear of God?”  Then he prayed to God and that\navaricious man died, and he who had been dead went alive to his house, and he lived for\nmany years after this.  And this holy man finished his good course, and he pleased God,\nand he died in peace.  Salutation to Marcius (Martianus), who was full of grace and\ngoodness, and who raised a man from the dead.\nAnd on this day also died Abba Daniel, who worked miracles for the King of Persia, and\nmade him to believe on the Name of Jesus Christ.  Now the cause of his believing was\nthis:  The King of Persia was sick of a grievous sickness in his belly, and the physicians\nwho dealt in magic could not heal him; and the King of Persia had a very wise magician,\nbut he was unable to heal him.  And when the king wished to kill the magician because\nof his failure to heal him, the magician spoke unto him with cunning words, saying, “O\nKing, seek out a child, and let his mother bind him with fetters, and let his father cut his\nthroat and bring to thee his heart, and when thou hast eaten it thou wilt recover.”  Now\nthe magician said this because he believed that the king would be afraid to do this thing,\nbut the king gave one thousand dinars in gold to the captain of his guard and told him to\ngo and search in the city for such a child and to buy him.  Now there were in the city\ntwo poor people, a man and his wife, and they had a little son, and when they heard the\nvoice of the herald, the love of money led them astray, and weeping they took their son\nto the king; and the child said, “I have confidence in God Who created me, and He will\nsave me.”  Then his mother bound him with fetters, and his father drew his knife to cut\nthe throat of his son before the king and his nobles, and the child lifted up his eyes to\nheaven and he spoke with his lips but uttered no sound.  And God put compassion in the\nheart of the king, and he commanded [the father] to release the boy and to bring him to\nhim.   And the king said, “What didst thou say when thou didst lift thine eyes up to\nheaven?”  And the boy said, “O my lord, if a man is oppressed his father and his mother\nought to deliver him, and if the mother is serious the king and his nobles ought to deliver\n\nhim.  As for me, seeing that there was no salvation for me from all of you, I prayed to\nGod Who created me.”  When the king heard his words of instruction he gave him one\nthousand dinars of gold.  And because of this God wished to have compassion on the\nking, and He sent unto him Daniel to heal him, and when Daniel came to him he worked\nmany miracles, and the king believed on the Name of Jesus Christ.  And Daniel baptized\nhim and all his men with Christian baptism, and the king was cured of his disease.  Then\nAbba Daniel departed to his own city, and he continued to strive strenuously, and he\ndied in peace.  Salutation to Daniel the monk who healed the King of Persia.\nAnd on this day also died Abba John of the monastery of Bizan.  And on this day are\ncommemorated Garses and Balaten.  Salutation to him that rebuked the foolish peoples\nby withholding the rain and dew for a period of three years, that is to say, to John the\npriest.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Laurestus, and Andreas, and the consecration of\nthe church of the monastery of Kalmon, and Mabranus, and Tratina, and Justina.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

Having lifted it\n\nupon a camel, the camel would not get up from his place; and when they had lifted it on\nto a second camel, that camel also would not get up, and although they beat it with many\nstripes it would not move at all.  Then they knew that this was the Will of God, and they\nbuilt a shrine over him, and buried him therein and departed.  And God wished to reveal\nthe body of Saint Minas.  Now there was in that desert a certain shepherd, and one day a\nsheep that was sick of a disease and had running sores went into the shrine, and slipped\ndown into the water of the well which was by the side of the shrine, and having rolled\nabout in it the sheep was healed straightway.  When the shepherd saw this thing and this\nmiracle, he marveled exceedingly and was frightened.  And he used to take some dust\nfrom the shrine, and wet it with water, and smear it over the sheep when they were sick,\nand straightway they were healed thereby.  And he used to do this always, and he healed\nall the sick persons who came to him by this thing.  And the Emperor Constantine heard\nof the report of this--now he had an only daughter who was sick through running sores--\nand he sent her to this place, but she could not strip herself naked because there were\nmen there.  And the princess asked the shepherd what he did when he healed the sick\nsheep, and the shepherd told her what he did.  And she took dust from that place, and\nmoistened it with water from that well, and she smeared her whole body therewith, and\nshe slept that night in the shrine.  And Saint Minas appeared and said unto her. “When\nthou risest up in the morning, dig, and thou shalt find my body”; and straightway she\nwas healed of her disease.  And when she rose up [and found that] she was healed of her\ndisease, she commanded [her servants] to dig in that place, and straightway she found\nthe body of Saint Minas.  And she rejoiced with an exceeding great joy, and she sent [a\nletter] to her father, and told him of this matter, and the emperor built a church over his\nbody.   And a beautiful church was built in his honor in the days of Arcadius and\nHonorius, the righteous emperors, and they commanded the people to build a great city\nthere.  And a great city was built there, as the righteous emperors commanded, and they\nlaid the body of Saint Minas in the church, and miracles and great wonders took place\nthrough his body.  And sick people of all nations used to come into that church, and they\nwere healed, and signs and wonders used to appear in that church.   And Satan was\nenvious, and he stirred up certain wicked men and they pulled down the church, and the\ncity was plundered, and they removed the body of Saint Minas.  And they built another\nchurch for him there, and laid his body therein, and signs and wonders took place therein\nwhich were far greater than those, which had taken place in the former church. \nSalutation to thee, O Minas, officer and nobleman, for whom thy mother prayed to the\nimage of the Virgin Mary.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Minas the Second, the sixty-first\nArchbishop of the city of Alexandria.  The parents of this holy man made him marry a\nwife when he was young, against his will, but he did not wish to transgress the\ncommand of his parents, and he fulfilled all the duty of marriage according to the Law\nof the Church, and the whole of this matter was to him as a dream.  When they brought\nhim with his wife into the marriage-chamber, he sat down and talked to her, saying, “O\nmy sister, what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul? \nThe world passeth away and the lust thereof passeth away, but, as it is written, ‘He who\ndoeth the Will of God shall endure for ever.’  Come now, let us make a covenant of God,\nand let us preserve our bodies and our virginity in purity.”  And his wife accepted his\nwords and she agreed with him that they should keep their bodies in purity.  Then he left\nher and went to the desert of Scete, and he became a monk in the monastery of Abba\nMacarius, and he dwelt there for many years as an ascetic and fighter.   When the\narchbishop his predecessor died, they took Abba Minas against his will, and made him\narchbishop; and he sat on the throne of Mark the evangelist for eighteen years, and he\nprotected his flock rightly and justly and he died in peace.   Salutation to Minas the\nSecond who renounced the world and regarded it as a shadow and as a thirst during\nwhich a man drinketh as in a dream.\nSalutation to thee, Victor, in whose admonitions the children rejoiced.  [Wanting in the\nBodleian MS.]\n\nAnd on this day beginneth the preaching of the fasting service of Soma Gena, for the\nbirth of our Lord Jesus Christ, which the Jacobite Christians established.\nSalutation to the House of Pachomus, which was consecrated by the holy, father\nTimothy.  [Wanting in the Bodleian MS.]\nAnd on this day also died the holy Maccabaeus of Kasbar, who fought until he fed with\nhis body the birds of heaven.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and his father was governor of the city and he\nhad married a wife and begotten children.  After this his wife died and his children, and\nforthwith he gave all his possessions to the poor and needy.  And he became a monk and\nhe fought strenuously and became an ascetic, and he multiplied greatly his ascetic labors. \nAnd he pleased God by his works, and his faith, and the beauty of his singing, and his\nrighteousness, and his excellence.  And all the bishops of the country of Egypt agreed\ntogether, and they took him against his will and they made him Archbishop of the city of\nAlexandria, and he took his seat upon the throne of Mark the evangelist.  And he read the\nHoly Gospel and his light appeared in the manner wherein he fulfilled the duties of his\nposition and his office, and he worked many miracles and wonders.  And he used to give\nto the poor and needy each day regularly whatsoever they lacked, and because of this\nAbba John, Archbishop of the city of Alexandria, used to be called “the merciful.”  And\nthe Jews and pagans held him in great reverence, and they feared him and honored him,\neven as it is written in the history of his strife; and he shepherded his flock wisely and\nwell, and he pleased God, and he died in peace.  Salutation to Archbishop Kiri, who was\ncalled “John the Merciful.”\nAnd on this day also Saint Xystus the bishop became a martyr by the hand of Maximus\nthe governor, who tortured the holy man with severe tortures and then cut off his head\nwith the sword.   And Xystus received the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the\nheavens.  Salutation to Xystus the martyr.\nAnd on this day also Saint Tatus (Tatia) became a martyr in the city of Rome, under\nAlexander the governor.  Having had her brought before him he said unto her, “Sacrifice\nto my gods”; and she said, “I will only sacrifice to Jesus Christ my God.”   And the\ngovernor commanded [his soldiers] to strip off the veil of her face, and when he saw her\nhe marveled at her beauty.  Her eyes were like the stars of the heavens, her figure was like\nthe palm, and her beauty was like that of the rose; and there was none who could be\ncompared with her at that time.  When the governor saw her his heart was carried away by\nlove for her, and he said unto her, “Obey me.  Offer sacrifice to the great god Apollo, and I\nwill make thee mistress of the palace.”  And Saint Tatus (Tatia) said unto him, “I am the\nbride of Jesus Christ, and I will worship none but He.  Permit me to go into the shrines of\nthy gods for I would see their power”; and the governor took her into the house of his\ngods.  And when Saint Tatus (Tatia) had gone in she prayed and entreated God to destroy\nthe idols, and straightway there was an earthquake, and the idols fell down from their\nthrones, and Apollo, their greatest idol, fell down and was broken in pieces, and many of\nthe priests of the temple died.  And the foul spirit who was in Apollo cried out, saying,\n“What hast thou to do with me, O holy woman of God?   Behold thou hast broken in\npieces my abode, and thou hast cast me out from it.”   When the emperor saw this he\ncommanded his soldiers to throw her down on her face and to beat her with whips until\nthe blood flowed from her body, now her blood was as white as milk, and they beat her\nuntil their muscles were tired.  And the angels of God inflicted pains on those who were\n\nbeating her, but their torturing affected Saint Tatus (Tatia) in no way.  And the emperor\nalso commanded the soldiers to give her to a famished lion, but when the lion came to her\nhe crouched at her feet and licked them; and a voice came from heaven, saying, “Rejoice,\nO pure one, for I am with thee.”  And when the emperor saw that there was no way of\ntouching her he commanded the soldiers to cut off her head with the sword, and the\nsoldiers did so, and she finished her fight.  And the Bishop of Rome came by night, and he\nwrapped her body up in costly cloths, and laid it in a chest inlaid with gold and silver, and\ninnumerable miracles took place through her body.  Salutation to Tatus (Tatia), perfect\nwithin and without, the dust at whose feet the lion licked.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Daniel the monk, and the Emperor Honorius. \nThis Abba Daniel was a fighter in the desert of Scete, in the monastery of Abba Mararius,\nand he lived for forty years and a half without tasting bread, or fish, or honey, or oil, for\nhe ate nothing except herbs and water.  And after he had done this for [many] days, a\nboastful idea came to him, and he said in his heart, “Who is there among the dwellers in\nthe desert of Scete that can fast as long as I do?”  When God saw the pride of his heart He\nsent unto him a shining angel who said unto him, “Why, O Daniel, dost thou boast thyself\nthus arrogantly, which is not good?  Our Lord Jesus Christ desires not pride but lowliness,\nand fear, and trembling.”  And Daniel said unto the angel, “Tell me, my lord, if there is\nanyone better than myself so that I may go and see him and I will confess to my God that I\nhave sinned.”  And the angel said unto him, “Honorius, Emperor of Rome (Constantinia),\nis a pure and holy man, and a fearer of God, he shall be thy companion in the kingdom of\nthe heavens.”  When Abba Daniel heard this he bowed and knelt down on the ground, and\nthrew dust on his head, and he asked God to bring him to the City of Rome (Constantinia)\nin His wisdom and power and to show him the emperor.  And whilst he was praying thus a\ncloud came by the command of God and brought him to the gates of Constantinia, and he\nfound there a servant of the Emperor Honorius.  When the servant saw Abba Daniel, he\nwas blessed by him, and he said unto him, “O my father, what is thy wish?  For what hast\nthou come hither?”  And Abba Daniel said unto him, “If thou art able to lead me to one of\nthe nobles of the city so that he may take me to the emperor, [do so].”  And the servant\nsaid unto him, “If I myself could take thee to the emperor wouldst thou come?”  And Abba\nDaniel said unto him, “If thou hast power to bring me to him God be blessed.”  And the\nservant said unto him, “O my father, what wouldst thou do with the sight of an earthly and\nmortal emperor?  Would it not be better for thee to see the kingdom of the heavens?”  And\nAbba Daniel said unto him, “If my God had not commanded me I should not have come\nhither.”  And the servant said unto him, “Wait, O my father, until I buy what my master\nrequires”; and straightway he bought bread, and salt, and vegetables, and vinegar.  And the\nservant took him to the place where Honorius was with a fellow monk, whose name was\nEulogius, according to his custom.  After Honorius returned from the place of [giving]\njudgment, he put on sackcloth and clean raiment and sat down.  And the servant leaving\nAbba Daniel outside the door went in, and when Honorius saw him he said unto him, “Art\nthou mad that thou makest Abba Daniel to stand outside the door?”  And Honorius went\nout with his companion, and he received Abba Daniel, and bowed down at his feet, and\nthey saluted each other with greetings of peace, and they went into the chamber and sat\ndown; and at the ninth hour the servant brought them food to eat, and they rose up and\nprayed.  Now Abba Daniel was afraid to eat bread lest he should fall ill, and he said unto\nHonorius and his companion, “O my lords, murmur not against me because I do not eat\nbread; it is not through pride that I refrain but through fear of sickness.”  Then they gave\nhim a few herbs and he ate according to his wont.  When they had finished the prayer of\nthe table Honorius enquired of Abba Daniel about his coming.  And Abba Daniel said unto\nhim, “If thou art able I wish thee to bring me to the Emperor, for I have come [to see him]\nat the command of Christ.”  And on the following day Honorius put on royal apparel,\nwhich bewitched the sight, and he sat upon his throne, and he made [his servant] bring in\nAbba Daniel.  And when Daniel saw the emperor he was afraid and trembled, and the\nservant seeing his fear took him from there and brought him to his abode.  When the\njudging was ended Honorius threw off his [royal] apparel, and put on the garb of the\nmonk, and went back to his dwelling.  And when Abba Daniel saw him, he said, “Why\ndidst thou not take me to the king, so that I might tell him what is in my heart and return\n\nto my place?”  And Honorius said unto him, “Why didst thou come?”  And Abba Daniel\nsaid unto him, “Thy servant brought me”; and when Honorius heard this he marveled and\nsaid unto him, “I am Honorius whom men call ‘Emperor of the Earth,’ and thou hast seen\nme sitting on my transitory throne.”  When Abba Daniel heard this he bowed down at his\nfeet, and adjured him to tell him the story of all his life.  And the Emperor Honorius told\nhim that for forty years he had neither eaten food nor worn raiment which he had not\nearned by the labor of his hands, that is to say the weaving of palm fiber, that what was\nleft of his daily food he gave to the poor, that his food was bread, and herbs, and vinegar\nand salt, that he never cursed any man, that he never craved for the goods of any man, and\nthat he had kept himself a virgin.  When Abba Daniel heard this he said unto him,\n“Forgive me for boasting myself over thee”; and Abba Daniel departed to his place\nsorrowfully, and in tears.  After two months had passed Honorius and his teacher Eulogius\nagreed together, and he departed from the palace, and God sent an angel who carried him\nto Abba Daniel, and they finished their strife and they both died on the same day; and\nEulogius and his disciple also died on that day.  Salutation to Honorius and to Abba\nDaniel his companion.  Salutation to Eulogius and to his servant who dwell together in\nheaven.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and he made her a palace, and he\nestablished her therein by herself so that she might never see a man.  And she used to\nthink about the end of this world, and she asked God by day and by night to teach her the\npath of righteousness and integrity.  And she saw a vision one night and it was as if one\nsaid unto her, “Send to the virgin Yona, the daughter of Philaspheron and she shall teach\nthee the way of God.”  When she awoke from her dream her soul rejoiced and she sent a\nmessage to the virgin Yona who made haste to come unto her; and Atrasis embraced her,\nand bowed down at her feet, and she entreated her to teach her and make manifest to her\nthe path of God.  And Yona the virgin told her the reason why the Son of God became a\nman, and she began to tell her [the history of the world] from the time when God created\nour father Adam, and how He expelled him from the Garden; and she told her about the\ndays of Noah, and how the water of the Flood came and destroyed all mankind, and how\nonly eight men were left [alive], and how the earth was renewed once more, and how men\nworshipped idols, and how God appeared to our father Abraham, and how the Israelites\nwent out from Egypt, and how the prophets proclaimed the coming of the Son of God, and\nhow Satan was master of the world through the worship of idols, and how the Son of God\ncame down from heaven, and took flesh of Mary so that He might save the children of\nmen from the dominion of Satan.  And Yona the virgin told her and made her to know\nabout heavenly grace, and the kingdom which is for ever, which God gives unto those\nwho labor for His holy Name’s sake.  When Atrasis the virgin heard the words of Yona she\nrejoiced exceedingly; and the words of Yona the virgin were unto her sweeter than honey\nand sugar, and straightway she believed on God.  And the two virgins lived together and\nthey fasted and they prayed by day and by night; and the king, the father of Atrasis, knew\nnothing of this matter.  One day they saw our Lord Jesus Christ, and His mother Mary the\npure and holy Virgin, and she took the two virgins and brought them to her Son as an\noffering, and He blessed them.  And the king, the father of Atrasis, departed to fight a\nbattle, and when he came back he came to his daughter and said unto her, “Come, my\ndaughter, cast incense to the god Apollo before thou comest to thy marriage (?).”  And\nAtrasis the virgin said unto her father, “Why dost thou forsake the God of heaven and\nworship foul idols?  Turn, O my father, to the God Who created thee and in Whose hand is\nthy soul and body.”  When the king her father heard these words, the like of which he had\nnever heard from her before, he marveled, and asked what had come to his daughter and\nwhat had changed her mind.   And [his servants] told him, “It is Yona the virgin, the\ndaughter of Philaspheron, who hath corrupted thy daughter’s heart.”   And the king\ncommanded [his soldiers] to burn them in the fire, and they dragged them out arrayed, as\nthey were in costly raiment wherein gold and silver were woven in cunning devices, and\nthey did not strip them naked because they were daughters of kings.  And there were many\nof their slaves, and their handmaidens, both small and great, who wept for them, and the\nmen of the city also wept and were sorry for those virgins, and they begged them to\nsubmit to the king so that he might not kill them; but they would not turn from their good\ncounsel, and their divine love.  And straightway the soldiers dug pits in the ground and\nthey lighted fires therein and the flames thereof rose to a great height.  And the two virgins\ntook each other’s hand and they cast themselves into the fire, and the people saw them\nstanding up in the fire with their faces turned towards the east, and they were praying, and\nafter that they died.  Now the fire was unto them as cool water.  And certain believing men\ntook away their bodies, and their countenances were unchanged, and their apparel was\nunscorched, and the fire had not touched the hair of their head; and they laid them in a\n\ngood place with great honor until the end of the days of persecution.  And they built a fine\nchurch and laid their bodies therein, and great signs and wonders were wrought there\nthrough them.  Salutation to the virgins Atrasis and Yona who died in the fire holding each\nother’s hand.\nAnd on this day also died Philip the apostle, one of the Twelve Apostles.  Now the lot fell\nupon this apostle to go to the country of ‘Afrakya (Phrygia), and all the region round\nabout, and he preached to the people thereof the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, our God\nand Redeemer; and he worked miracles there which astonished the hearts [of men].  And\nwhen Peter and Philip drew nigh to the city a certain man in whom was an evil spirit\nreceived them, and he cried out, saying, “O Apostles of Christ, I will not let you go into\nthe city.”  And Peter knew that [he was possessed of] a spirit of devils, and then and there\nhe rebuked him, and Satan went out of him, and the man was healed and he followed the\napostles into the city.  Now there was above the gate of the city an exceedingly high pillar,\nand when they came to that gate Peter entreated God, saying, “I beseech Thee, O my Lord\nJesus Christ, that this gate, and this high pillar and the things which are on it may fall\ndown upon the earth in such a manner that the hand of a man may touch them.”  And at\nthat moment the gate, and the pillar, and the things, which were on it, fell down upon the\nearth, and they appeared to be like the face of the earth.  And Peter said unto the man from\nwhom the foul spirit had gone forth, “Go up and cry out,” and he cried out, saying,\n“Apostle of Christ, I will cry out as thou commandest me.” And similarly he commanded\nhim to speak with his mouth so that awe might fall upon the men of that city.  And that\nman went up from the ground upon the pillar which had stood over the gate, and Peter\nsaid unto him, “In the Name of my Lord Jesus Christ let it be raised up,” and at that very\nmoment the gate raised itself up, and the pillar which was upon it, and the doors resumed\nthe place which they had formerly.  And the man cried out with a loud voice, saying, “O\nmen who live in this city, assemble ye in the place where are the Apostles of Christ, our\nLord, that they may bless you and may entreat Him to forgive you your sins.”  And whilst\nthe man was standing upon the top of the pillar and saying these words, there was an\nearthquake and lightning, and the men of the city were frightened, and they feared\nexceedingly, and they went into the houses, and caverns, and islands (sic), and the\nlightning pursued them wherever they went; and many men, and women also, died of\nfright at the noise of the thunder and the lightening. And because of this groups of people\ncame to the apostles, and they looked at them, their hands being stretched out, and they\nmade supplication to God, and they fell on the ground and bowed low before them,\nsaying, “O servants of God, we beseech thee to have mercy upon us.”  And the apostles\nmade entreaty to God on their behalf, and the thunder ceased and there was no more\nlightning; and they all believed on our Lord Jesus Christ, and the apostles brought them to\nthe knowledge of God, and after this they made them to enter the True Faith.  And [Philip]\nwent outside the city and turned the people to the knowledge of God, but those who did\nnot believe on the Lord Jesus Christ took counsel together against Philip so that they\nmight seize him and kill him.  Now they enjoyed the favor of the king, and he would not\nallow them to enter into their alien city.  When Philip came to them they rose up against\nhim, and seized him, and shut him up in prison.  And he used to laugh before them, and\nsay unto them, “Why do ye go away from everlasting life, and why do ye not think about\nthe salvation of your souls?”  And they rose up against him, and seized him, and shut him\nup in prison; and they tortured him with severe tortures, and they suspended him head\ndownwards, and he delivered up his soul whilst still under torture.  And when they wanted\nto burn his body in the fire, an angel of God snatched it out of their hands whilst they\nstood looking at him, and he carried it to a place outside the city of Jerusalem.  And when\nthey saw this great miracle they all cried out with a loud voice, saying, “One is the Lord\nGod of Saint Philip the apostle.”  And they were sorry and repented that they had tortured\nhim, and they entreated God by day and by night until the body of Saint Philip returned. \nAnd when they saw it they rejoiced exceedingly, and they came back to the Faith of our\nLord Christ, and through the body of Philip God made manifest signs and miracles. \nSalutation to Philip and Eleutherus.\n\nAnd on this day also Eleutherus, and his mother Entia, who belonged to a noble family of\nthe city of Rome, became martyrs.   This holy man was brought up by a God-fearing\nbishop whose name was Anicetus.   When he was sixteen years of age he was made a\ndeacon, when he was eighteen he was made a priest, and at the age of twenty years he was\nmade bishop of the country of ‘Elerikos.  In those days Andrianus the emperor came to the\ncity of Rome, and when he heard about Eleutherus he commanded Pilkes to bring him to\nhim; and Pilkes found him in the church teaching the Word of God.  When Pilkes heard\nthe Faith of Eleutherus, he believed and was baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ.  When\nhe had brought Eleutherus to Andrianus the emperor, he said unto him, “Offer sacrifice to\nthe gods.  Thou art a free man, why dost thou worship a man who was crucified?”  And\nEleutherus said, “My freedom is the Cross of Jesus Christ, Who is the Creator of the\nheavens and of the earth.”  When the emperor heard this he commanded [his soldiers] to\nthrow him into a red-hot oven and to shut him in; and they did so, and straightway the\nfiery oven was cooled; and [they threw him on the wheel, and] the wheel was broken. \nWhen the emperor saw this he marveled greatly, and not knowing what to do he\ncommanded the soldiers to throw him into prison.  And a raven brought him food from the\nGarden (i.e. Paradise) and he ate and was satisfied.  And when Illyricus (?) the governor\nsaw him, he believed in the God of Saint Eleutherus, and they cut off his head with a\nsword.  And Andrianus commanded his soldiers to bring small horses, and to harness them\nto a chariot, and they tied Eleutherus to the middle of the chariot, and they dragged him\nabout until is limbs were cut to pieces.  And straightway an angel of God came down and\nreleased him from his fetters, and he took him into a high place, and he sat down with the\nwild beasts glorifying God.  And straightway Andrianus ordered his soldiers to hunt down\nthe wild beasts that were in the mountain in which they had found Eleutherus, and they\ntook Eleutherus to Andrianus the emperor.   When they had brought him to him the\nemperor commanded them to give him to the lions, and when the lions came they licked\nthe moisture from his face and feet; and all the men of Rome wondered.  Now the lions\nhad slain fifty hundred pagans.  When the emperor saw this he was filled with wrath, and\nhe commanded two soldiers to spear him [and they did so].  And his mother Entia also--\nafter they had tortured her greatly, they speared her with him, and whilst she was\nembracing the neck of her son they delivered up their souls to God.   Salutation to\nEleutherus.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and when the\npeople were gathered together, and Gregory, the preacher of Divinity, was with them, a\nvoice came unto them saying, “Seek for Gregory, the dweller in the desert, and set him\nover you.”  And they sought for him but found him not, and they continued [to seek for\nhim] for many days.  And whilst they were seeking for him in the desert and mountains,\nhe was nigh unto them though they knew it not.  And when they found him not they all\nwith one accord agreed and took a Book of the Gospels and set it over them, and this\nBook which they set over them they named “Gregory, the preacher of Godhead.”  And the\nangel of the Lord appeared unto this Saint Gregory, and said unto him, “Rise up and get\nthee gone, for they have made thee bishop over them; and refuse not this thing, for it is\nfrom God.”  And he was unable to resist the Divine command, and he descended from the\nmountain, and went to them, and they went forth to meet him with great honor, and they\ncarried out his enthronement.  And God made manifest through him signs and wonders\ninnumerable, and because of this he was called “Gregory, the worker of signs and\nmiracles,” because of the multitude of his signs and wonders.  Now there was a certain\nsmall lake wherein two brethren used to catch many fish, which they sold for much\nmoney, and they disputed between themselves about the lake, each one saying, “This Lake\nbelongs to me only.”   When they were unable to agree about it they came to Bishop\nGregory to make a decision about that lake for them, and he decided that they should\ndivide the lake between them.  And when they refused to agree together as he commanded\nthem, and they would not do as the saint told them, but each continued to say, “I will take\nit for myself,” straightway Saint Gregory asked God concerning that lake.  And the earth\nswallowed up the lake, and the water became dry land, and it remains so to this day.  And\nthe report of the signs and wonders, which he used to work, was heard in all the earth; and\nhaving finished his good fight he died in peace [and departed] from this fleeting world and\nentered into everlasting joy.  Salutation to Gregory whose odor is sweeter then cinnamon,\nand who dried up a lake about which two brethren quarreled.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Cosmas, the fifty-first Archbishop of the\ncity of Alexandria.  On this holy man came tribulation and much sorrow, and in his days\ngreat tribulation came upon the Christians.   And about that time also the King of the\nMuslims put them to shame, for he commanded that the Christians and the Jews should\nnot wear white apparel, and that they should distinguish themselves by wearing apparel\nthe color of indigo.  And in the days of this holy father many signs and wonders appeared,\nand among them was the wonder of the figure of our holy Lady the Virgin Mary, which\nwas in the church of Saint Severus in the desert of Scete; this figure opened itself down on\none side, and from it much blood flowed.  And there were many figures [of the Virgin] in\nthe country of Egypt from the eyes of which tears flowed in abundance, and those who\nhave understanding and wisdom will know that this took place because of the tribulation,\nand trials and sorrow which came upon the bishops and the believers.  And after this God\ngave good days in the place of those days which were bad.  And this father taught the\nbelievers continually, and he strengthened them in the True Faith; and he sat upon the\n\nthrone of Mark for seven years and five months.  He died on the twenty-first day of the\nmonth of Khedar in the five hundred and seventy-fifth year of the martyrs (A.D. 859), and\nhe was buried in a cave near Donosor.   Salutation to thy upright episcopacy, thou on\naccount of whose sorrow the figure of the Virgin shed tears.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated the holy martyrs Alphaeus, and Zacchaeus, and\nRomanus, and John, and Thomas, and Victor, and Isaac from the city of Eshmunen. \nSalutation to you, O ye bright stars of Eshmunen.\nAnd on this day also died Abba John of the city of Asyut.  The parents of this holy man\nwere glassmakers, and when this saint was born they brought him up under good\nadmonitions and teaching; after he grew up they taught him the craft of the carpenter, and\nafter a few days, when his father and his mother were dead, he departed to the saints Abba\nIsidore and Abba Bayman and adopted the garb of the monk; and he devoted himself so\nstrenuously to fasting and prayer that his name was heard of in remote monasteries.  Then\nthe angel of the Lord appeared unto him and commanded him to go to his own country\nand to teach the people thereof the way of righteousness.   Now he never left his cell\nexcept to receive the Offering.  And one day two holy old men came to him, Abba Abzel\nand Abba Besoy, and before they had come near him he cried out from a distance, saying,\n“Peace to your visit, O my fathers,” and he addressed them by their names though he\nknew them not.  And they marveled greatly.  And Saint Sinoda, the pillar of Egypt, used to\nvisit him often and embrace him.  When the wicked pagans attacked the land of Egypt and\nwar broke out, the Emperor Theodosius sent the governor of Egypt who marched against\nthem.  And he sent Saint John and took his cross, and the saint said unto the governor,\n“Fear not.  Thou shalt conquer,” and so it came to pass according to his word.  And war\nbroke out a second time against Theodosius, and he sent [to enquire of] Saint John [how it\nwould end, and the saint said unto him], “Be not sad.   Thou shalt conquer,” and the\nEmperor Maximianus conquered them (i.e. the enemy).  One day the Emperor Theodosius\ncommanded [his soldiers] to kill the men of Asyut and to plunder their city because of the\ngreat work of foulness, which they had done.  Now the angel of God made Abba John to\nknow this before the governor arrived.  When the men of the city heard of the emperor’s\ncommand they went up the mountain to Abba John [and he said unto them], “Be not sad,\nfor God will save you.”  When the governor arrived, he came into the cell of this holy man\nJohn in order to be blessed by him, and Abba John told the governor everything which the\nemperor had commanded; and when the governor heard this he was amazed and he\nprostrated himself before his holiness.  And the governor had a son who was eighteen\nyears old and who was possessed by the spirit of a devil, and he asked the holy man to\nheal him.  And the holy may prayed over some oil and water, and having anointed him\ntherewith he was healed straightway.  Then the saint asked the governor to write to the\nemperor, and to abandon the slaughter of the men of Asyut, and the governor wrote a\nletter to him and gave it to Abba John.  And having taken the letter and gone into his cell,\nhe prayed, and a cloud of light came and it took up Abba John and brought him to the\nemperor, and when the emperor had a table prepared Saint John threw the letter upon it. \nAnd the emperor took it and read it, and he found that it was the letter, which the governor\nhad written for Father John.  And having lifted up his eyes he saw a cloud of light above\nhim, and he was terrified.  Then he wrote a letter to the governor in his own handwriting\nand under his own secret sign, [telling him] to abandon the destruction of the city through\nthe prayer of Abba John.  And the emperor threw his letter on the cloud, and those who\nwere assembled there saw a hand receive it, and it went inside the cloud; and during that\nnight the saint returned to the mountain; and on the following day he gave the letter with\nthe emperor’s seal upon it to the governor.  When the governor saw it he was amazed, and\nhe praised God for the saving of the city, and he departed to his own country.  And the\nfame of Saint John being noised abroad a certain noble lady, a kinswoman of the emperor,\nwent to him to be healed of her disease, and by his prayer she was healed.   Then the\nEmperor Theodosius died and the wicked Marcian reigned, and he brought tribulation\nupon our father Dioscurus.  And Abba John sent him a letter abusing him and cursing him\nbecause he had changed the Faith, and after a few days God killed him.  When Abba John\nwas one hundred and twenty-five years old he knew that his [time of] rest had come, and\n\nas he was praying to God he fell forward on his face on the ground, and delivered up his\nsoul into the hand of his Creator.  And innumerable signs and wonders appeared at his\ngrave.  Salutation to John who was arrayed in holiness.\nAnd on this day took place the translation of the body of Saint Deborah, who is also called\n“Tchebare,” of the city of Dalbat; her story is written in the book of her strife.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

And alms and oblations cannot ascend to God except through them even as Saint\nJohn the evangelist says in the Vision of the Apocalypse, “I saw the place of Four and\nTwenty elders round about Him, and they were sitting on four and twenty thrones; and on\ntheir heads were four and twenty crowns, and in their hands were four and twenty censers\ncontaining sweet-smelling incense, which is the prayers of the saints who dwell upon\nearth, and which they make to rise up before God, the Sustainer of the Universe.”  And he\nalso says, “And I heard Four Beasts praising and saying, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord [God] of\nHosts, the heavens and the earth are filled full of the holiness of Thy glory.   And\nstraightway the four and twenty priests of heaven fell down with their faces to the ground,\nand they took off their crowns, and they said unto Him, Glory, and honor, and thanks are\nfitting for Thee.  And when a command went forth from God they fell down again with\ntheir faces to the ground, saying, Glory, and power, and judgment, and righteousness\nbelong to our God” (Rev. iv and v).  And because the doctors of the Church have found\nstatements about these Four and Twenty Priests of heaven in the Holy Scriptures, and have\nseen stories told of them by the Apostles and in their Canon, saying that they are nigh unto\nGod, they have ordered and ruled, saying, “The name of him that celebrates their\ncommemoration shall be revealed upon earth.  And they shall entreat God on his behalf to\nforgive him all his sins.”  Therefore the doctors of the Church tell the people to honor the\nfestival of the commemoration of the Four and Twenty Priests of heaven.  Salutation to\nyou, O priests of the Law.\nAnd on this day Azkir, the priest of Nagran, and eight and thirty men who were with him\nbecame martyrs in the days of the kingdom of Sarabhel, the King of Hamir.   And he\ncommanded his soldiers to bring ‘Azkir to him, and they brought him into the prison\nhouse and shut the door on him, and he commanded the keepers of the prison that no man\nwas to be taken to him.  And when Saint ‘Azkir had prayed, the doors of the prison house\nwere opened, and fifty men came in, and he made a cistern of water there, and he baptized\nthem therein in the Name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost.  When Sarabhel\nthe king heard this he commanded his soldiers to bring ‘Azkir out of the prison house and\nto take him to another place; and the holy man met a man whose name was Cyriacus, who\nsaid unto him, “Good news for thee, O ‘Azkir; they are taking thee to martyrdom.”  When\nthe king’s guards heard this they bound Cyriacus with ‘Azkir in fetters.  And on the road\nthey met two men, and they said unto him, “Baptize us for Christ’s sake”; and ‘Azkir\nprayed to God, and water sprang up in the desert, and he baptized the two men and\nCyriacus.  When they reached the desert the guards and their beasts lacked water, and they\nbesought Saint ‘Azkir to entreat God on their behalf because they were short of water. \nAnd ‘Azkir prayed to God and straightway a cloud came and poured down rain into the\nwaterholes to the depth of the hand, and seven hundred men and their beasts drank of that\nwater and were satisfied.  And they brought ‘Azkir to the King of Hamir, and he said unto\nhim, “What is this new doctrine which thou hast brought into my country?”  And Saint\n‘Azkir said unto him, “It is not a new doctrine, but one which the prophets have preached\nin the Book of the Law, and it hath been heard that the King of the Jews was crucified in\nthe Christian Faith.”  And one of the Rabbanat rose up and said unto the king, “O my lord,\ncommand [thy soldiers] to take him into the city, and let them hang him upon a tree, and\n\nburn him alive”; and the king commanded according to his words.  And when they had\nbrought ‘Azkir to the city of Nagran they hung him upon a tree and lighted a fire [under\nhim].  And when Saint ‘Azkir had prayed, his fetters were loosed and he went forth alive\nfrom the fire.  And the Jews said also, “Come, let us stone him”; and the greater number\nof the Jews killed him by stoning, and the rest took swords and cut off his head.  Thus\nSaint ‘Azkir finished his martyrdom and departed to everlasting life.  Salutation to ‘Azkir.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Claudius, and Gayyos, and Artyo, and Dioscurus\nthe martyr, who died on this day.\nAnd on this day also died Abba Yosef (Joseph) of the city of Sana.  The parents of this\nholy man were rich in faith, and they had no son except Yosef (Joseph); and they brought\nhim up very carefully and piously, and they taught him the Books of the Church. Now his\nform and appearance resembled those of Joseph, the son of Jacob.  When he had grown up\nthere entered into his heart the remembrance of death and the transitoriness of the world,\nand he went into a monastery and became a monk, and a fighter in the spirit; he devoted\nhimself to fasting and to prayer, and he shut himself in his cell, and never went out except\non the day of the Sabbath, at the time of the Offering.  And the report of him was noised\nabroad, and the men of Adyam came to him to receive his blessing.  And his father and his\nmother had no news of him, and they continued to make supplication to God that He\nwould enable them to find him; and when they heard the report of him they went to him so\nthat he might pray for the discovery of their son.  When they came to him he knew them,\nbut they did not know him, and after the men had removed themselves he made himself\nknown unto them, and commanded them to tell no man; and he comforted them and sent\nthem away in peace.  And God bestowed upon him the power to work signs and wonders,\nand at length Satan was envious of him.  And he went to the governor of the city and told\nhim that this holy man had much money, and the governor sent soldiers who bound the\nholy man in fetters and brought him to the prison house.  On the following day when they\nlooked for him they found the fetters thrown about on the ground; and the governor was\nterrified and bowed down at his feet and did reverence to him and sent him into his own\nhouse.  After much strenuous fighting he died in peace, and signs and wonders, which\nwere innumerable, appeared at his grave.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

now the\nancestors of the holy man had been in days of old pagans.  And when they received the\ngift of Christian baptism, they called the father of the holy man “Noah,” and his mother\n“Tabot,” and Philopator “Mercurius.”  And the Dog-faces, according to what the angel of\nthe Lord said unto them when he appeared unto them, were in subjection to the holy man\nMercurius, and his father.  And when the king heard the story of the Dog-faces and how\nGod had changed their savage natures, [he ordered his soldiers to bring in wild beasts]\nbefore the king, and the Dog-faces destroyed all the wild beasts, which the king brought\nbefore them.  When the king saw this he was afraid of them exceedingly, and he asked the\nfather of Saint Mercurius to entreat God to remove from them their savage nature, and to\nmake them to possess the nature of men; and he asked God, and God changed their nature\nand they became like men.  Then the king took the holy father Mercurius and appointed\nhim governor and captain of the army, and these Dog-faces were subject unto him, and all\nthe people were afraid of them.  After this a certain wicked king rose up and he wished to\nmake war upon another king, and the king sent his soldiers to entice those Dog-faces and\nto bring them to him.  And that wicked king, who wished to make war on the king of the\ncity wherein the father of Saint Mercurius lived, enticed them.  And straightway he was\nangry at the Dog-faces, and he punished one of them, who became a martyr thereby, and\nthe other fled.  When the father of Saint Mercurius returned to the city he sought for his\nson and his mother and found them not.  Now the king, having heard that the father of\nSaint Mercurius was killed in battle, decided to take the mother of Saint Mercurius and\nmarry her.  And one of the soldiers of the king knowing what the king intended to do,\nwent and told the mother of Saint Mercurius what the king had decided concerning her. \nWhen she heard this she asked him to take [her] out secretly, and she went out with her\nson the blessed Mercurius.  And his father having sought for his wife and his son, and\nfound them not, knew not in the least what had become of them.  And the king was afraid\nbecause he thought that the Dog-faces lived with him, and that he would become angry\nand would turn them loose, and they would destroy all the city.  And the king commanded\nhis servants not to tell him that he intended to marry his wife.  After this war broke out\nagainst the king, and the father of Saint Mercurius went out to fight, and the king took him\nprisoner.  Now by the Will of God the king of Rome was a Christian.  And when he knew\nthat the father of Saint Mercurius was a Christian, he spared him and did not kill him, and\nhe made him governor of all the city of the Mardosaweyan.  And by the Will of God Saint\nMercurius and his mother were in the city of Rome, and when his father came into the\nchurch the mother of Saint Mercurius saw him and knew that he was her husband.  One\n\nday when they were sitting in the guest house the father of Mercurius and his soldiers rode\nout, and the mother of the blessed Mercurius dressed her son in the fine raiment which he\nused to wear in the royal city, and commanded him to go and mount the horse of the\ngovernor, that is to say of his father.   And having mounted the governor’s horse, the\nsoldiers seized him and brought him before the governor, that is to say his father, who did\nnot know that he was his son, and he was angry with him.  And the mother of Mercurius\ncame to her husband, now he did not know that she was his wife, and she said unto him,\n“We are strangers, and when I knew that thou was a stranger I thought that my son might\nbe with thee”; and when he asked her questions and enquired concerning her journey she\ntold him that she was his wife.   And straightway he knew her and he knew his son\nMercurius, and he placed [him] in the church, and they lived there together.  When the\nfather and mother of Saint Mercurius died, the king took him and made him governor of\nthe city of the Mardosaweyan in his father’s stead; and the one Dog-face that had\nremained with him up to the time he was appointed governor, used to go forth with\nMercurius in battle.  When they wanted to fight God used to restore to the Dog-face his\noriginal savage nature, and there was none who could stand before him.  And there were\ngiven to this Saint Mercurius power, and great strength, and he was more renowned and\nmore exalted than all the other officers of the kingdom.  Now the Emperor of Rome in\nthose days was called Decius and he worshipped idols.  And his enemies the Barbarians\nrose up against him, and he assembled his armies and went forth to fight against them; and\nthey were an many as the sand of the sea, and the emperor was dismayed and was afraid. \nAnd Saint Mercurius said unto him, “Fear not, for God shall assuredly destroy our\nenemies and bring them into our hand.”  Now Mercurius saw before him in the battle the\nangel of the Lord, and he had a drawn sword in his hand, and he said unto them, “Conquer\nand fear not, O Mercurius.”  And after this a shining man in white apparel appeared unto\nhim, and he had in his hand a drawn sword, which he gave to Mercurius, saying, “When\nthou hast overcome thine enemies remember the Lord thy God.”   And straightway\nMercurius conquered his enemies and returned in great joy.  Then the angel of the Lord\nappeared, and said unto him, “Why hast thou forgotten and hast not remembered the\nName of the Lord thy God?”  And the period of the war being ended the Emperor Decius\nwant to offer up incense to the gods on behalf of himself and his army.   And Saint\nMercurius tarried behind, and did not go forth with the emperor to the festival in the\ntemple.   And a certain man informed the Emperor Decius and said unto him, “Saint\nMercurius hath not come with thy army, and he hath not associated himself with the\noffering of incense to the gods.”  And the emperor sent straightway and had Mercurius\nbrought to him, and he marveled at him, the love for him having forsaken his heart.  And\nthe emperor said unto him, “Why hast thou forgotten thy love for me and hast not come\nwith me to offer incense to the gods?”  And straightway Saint Mercurius cast his girdle\nand his military attire down before the Emperor Decius, and he said unto him, “I will not\ndeny my Lord Jesus Christ, and I will not bow down to filthy idols.”   And when the\nEmperor Decius heard this he was exceedingly wroth, and he commanded his soldiers to\nbeat him with rods made of green palm wood, and with ox-hide whips; and they did as the\nemperor commanded.  And straightway the emperor was afraid lest the people of the city\nshould rise up against him, and he bound him in irons and sent him to Caesarea in\nCappadocia, and he commanded the soldiers there to torture him severely and to cut off\nhis head with the sword.  And they tortured him there, even as the emperor commanded,\nand they cut off his head with the sword, and he finished his fight and received the crown\nof martyrdom in the kingdom of heaven.  And after he had received an incorruptible and\nheavenly crown, and had entered into life everlasting, churches were built to him in all the\nends of the earth, and God made manifest in them signs and great wonders.  And some of\nhis miracles took place when Julian, who denied our Lord Jesus Christ, was reigning, and\nin the days of Saint Basil, Bishop of the country of Caesarea and Cappadocia, even as it is\nwritten in one of the works of Saint Basil.  Now Julian the infidel had inflicted very great\ntribulation upon those who believed in our Lord Jesus Christ, and he was wroth with Saint\nBasil and shut him up in prison, and he multiplied his works against the believers.  And\nSaint Basil gathered together the believers and he prayed and made entreaty unto God\nconcerning Julian the infidel, and he made intercession with Saint Mercurius.  And God\nheard his prayer and sent His great and holy martyr Mercurius, and he came riding upon a\n\nhorse and he speared Julian the infidel with his spear in his head, and the emperor died an\nevil death during the war in the land of Persia.  And when Saint Basil had seen this vision\nin the picture of Saint Mercurius he rejoiced with very great joy.  And he came into the\nplace wherein was the body of the great martyr Saint Mercurius, and whilst he was sitting\ndown there and thinking about what he had seen, straightway the sword and the spear of\nSaint Mercurius returned to their places, and from them there dropped so much blood that\nthe whole space beneath the picture of Saint Mercurius was full of it.  And straightway\nSaint Basil cried out and said, “O martyr of Christ, to Whom be glory! Hast thou indeed\nkilled Julian the enemy of righteousness?”  And Saint Mercurius in the picture bowed his\nhead before the face of Saint Basil as much as to say, “Yea, I have killed him.”  And Saint\nBasil multiplied his praises to God, and he paid Him honor and gave thanks unto Him. \nAnd Saint Mercurius wrought very many signs and wonders.  And there was a certain\nyoung Muslim who was a son of one of the officers of the city of Mesr (Cairo), and he\nwas learned in the Law of the Muslims but had since been baptized with Christian\nbaptism.  Then one of the king’s guards seized him, and he made ready a deep pit and\nlighted a great fire therein in order that he might burn him in it; and many men gathered\ntogether to see him [burnt].  And that young Muslim drew nigh unto the martyr whom the\nroyal guard had seized, and he said unto him, “O infidel, why dost thou run to enter into\nSheol?  At thine end thou wilt sit in the fire of Gahannam, because thou dost attribute a\nSon to God, and dost confess Three Persons.   Hearken unto me and abandon thy\nblasphemy and thine abominable words.”  And the Christian answered and said unto him,\n“We Christians are not infidels, but we worship One God, and He is Father, and Son, and\nHoly Ghost.  The Son is not alien to God His Father, for He is His Word.  Likewise the\nHoly Spirit, the mystery of our Faith, is wonderful, and is hidden from you, because your\nheart is not able to bear Him, and thy heart at this moment is dark and the light of the\nFaith illumineth it not.  But I can see that after a few days the light shall draw nigh unto\nthee, and that the light of Christ shall shine in thine heart.  And thou shalt fight spiritually\neven as do I for His Name, and thou shalt feel the same pain which I am now suffering.” \nWhen the Muslim heard his words he was exceedingly worth with him, and he put off his\nsandals from his feet and buffeted the face and mouth and head of the Christian and\npunished him severely, and he said unto him, “What thou sayest shall never happen to me,\nO thou infidel.”  And the blessed man answered and said unto him, “Needs must that thou\nremember what I say unto thee.”  And straightway they cut off his head with the sword,\nand they threw his body into the pit of fire, and the flames of that fire mounted upwards\nand became like a great wall.  And the body of the Christian remained in that fire three\ndays and three nights, and the royal guard watched him by day and by night, and\nafterwards they found the body and it was tried like gold and the fire had not touched it\nall; and they told this to the king, and he commanded the soldiers to bury the body.  And\nthe young Muslim went into his house being sorrowful, and he neither ate nor drank.  And\nhis father, and mother, and brethren gathered about him, and they said unto him, “What\nhath happened to thee?  Why dost thou neither eat nor drink?”  And he told them what the\nmartyr of our Lord Jesus Christ had said unto him, and they comforted him, and they said\nunto him, “Put aside the word which this erring man spoke unto thee, and dismiss his\nprediction from thy heart”; but he was in no wise comforted.   And in those days that\nyoung Muslim saw many Muslims, and they were wishing to go to the tomb of their lying\nprophet, and he said unto his father, “I should like to go with them”; and his father\nrejoiced exceedingly at these words, and he gave him one hundred dinars, and committed\nhim to the care of his friend, and the young man departed.  And as the young man was\njourneying with his friend, he saw a vision one night, and it seemed that an aged monk,\nshining with light, stood up by his side, and that he said unto him, “Come, follow me that\nthou mayest be saved”; and the monk appeared again on the second night, and again on\nthe third night, and each time he spoke unto him as above.  When they had finished their\nbusiness, having arrived at their destination, they turned back, and journeyed for a period\nof six days in the desert.  And as they were traveling by night the young man got down\nfrom his camel because of a bodily need, and his companions left him and departed; and\nhe remained by himself lost in the desert, and he wept, being afraid lest the wild beasts\nshould eat him.  Then he remembered the church of Saint Mercurius the martyr in the city\nof Mesr (Cairo), which was near his father’s house, and he said in his heart, “Every man\n\nmakes vows to him, and he fulfils for them everything which they ask him.”   And\nstraightway the young man said, as he wept, “O Mercurius, martyr of Christ, if thou wilt\ndeliver me from the wild beasts of the desert, and wilt bring me out safe from the desert, I\nwill become a Christian.”  And having said this, behold there came unto him a young man\nriding upon a horse, and his appearance was exceedingly goodly, and he was wearing\nglorious apparel, and his loins were girt with a girdle of gold, and he stood before him and\nsaid unto him, “Whence comest thou?  Why art thou alone and lost in this desert?”  And\nhe said unto him, “I got down [from my camel] because of a bodily need, and they left me\nand departed.”  And the man on the horse said unto him, “Come, get up behind me on this\nhorse,” and he mounted the horse with him, and the horse flew through the air, and\nbrought them quickly to the church of Mercurius the martyr in the city of Mesr (Cairo). \nAnd the doors of the church flew open to him, and he went in with him on the horse, and\nhe brought him to the martyrium of the sanctuary, and then disappeared from him and was\nno more seen.  And the young Muslim stood up in the church frightened, and he said in his\nheart, “Is this one of the churches of the Christians?”   And he saw the lamps burning\nbefore the picture [of the saint], and this seemed to him to be a dream, and he said, “Am I\nnot still sitting down in the desert?”  And he remained in the sanctuary until the dawn. \nAnd the steward of the church came and found him standing in the sanctuary, and he\nthought that he was a thief, and the steward wanted to cry out, but the young Muslim\nmade a sign to him with his hand, and he said unto him, “Come to me”; and the steward\nwent to him.  And the young man said unto him, “What is this place?”  And the steward\nsaid unto him, “This is the church of Saint Mercurius of Mesr (Cairo).”  And the young\nman said unto him, “Is this the city of Mesr (Cairo)?”  And the steward said unto him,\n“Yea,” and he added, “It seems that thou art too stupefied to talk to me; but now, O my\nbrother, make me to know what hath happened to thee.”   Then straightway courage\nreturned to the young man, and he said unto him, “How can I help being stupefied? Seeing\nthat during the past night I was in such and such a desert.  And I have no knowledge\nwhatsoever of how I came here; only God knows.”  When the steward heard the name of\nthat desert he marveled, and said unto the young man, “Did I not say rightly that thou art\nstupefied, and that thou dost not know what thou art saying?  The journey from that desert\nto this place occupies twelve days.   Verily thou art a thief, and it is the might of the\nblessed martyr Mercurius that hath seized thee and bound thee here without ropes and\nfettering irons.  This Mercurius the blessed martyr forsook the glory of this world and\nthrust it away, and the infidels tortured him with severe tortures for the Name of Christ,\nand the martyr died and God received him into His kingdom, and churches are built in his\nname everywhere; and in them the saint praises God, and makes intercession for all men. \nAnd for all those who commit themselves to him in prayer he makes intercession, and he\nmakes manifest miracles.”  And the young man said unto the steward, “What are his form\nand features like?” and the steward said unto him, “He resembles thee in stature”; and\nthen he showed him the picture of the saint.  When the young man saw the picture of Saint\nMercurius the martyr, he said unto the steward, “Verily this is the holy man who appeared\nunto me in the desert, and who bore me on his horse, and brought me hither.  And behold,\nthis is the girdle of gold wherewith I saw his loins girt.”  And he said unto the steward,\n“Behold, I tell thee that I am a Muslim, I belong to this city, and the name of my father is\nRaga, the judge; this miracle is sufficient to make me become a Christian.  And now hide\nme, and do not reveal my business to any man.  And also bring me a aged priest that he\nmay teach me the way of God, and may strengthen me in the True Faith, and may bring\nme . . . ” And the steward put him in a place by himself, and brought to him a priest, even\nas he said, and the priest baptized him with Christian baptism, and brought to him the\nBooks of the Church and the Gospel; and he remained thus.  And about one month after\nthis those men who had journeyed to Mecca arrived, and all the Muslims who were their\nkinsmen went out to meet them.  And the judge, the father of the young man, met the\nfriend, who wept bitterly, and he told the judge how his son had stayed behind in the\ndesert, and how they had left him and come on.  When his father heard this he rent his\ngarments, and his brethren and the young men also rent their garments, and they sat down\nand mourned for three days.  After this a certain Muslim woman saw the young man who\nhad become a Christian coming out of the church of Saint Mercurius.  And a Muslim (sic)\nwent and told his father and his brethren [this], and said unto them, “If it were not that\n\nyour son died in the desert on the Mecca road, I should be inclined to say that the young\nman whom I saw this day by the church of Saint Mercurius the martyr was he; he was\nwearing the white apparel which the monks wear, and in truth he was like your son.” \nWhen the father and mother and brethren of the young man heard this they rose up, and\nwent [there] and found him, and they seized him, and said unto him, “What hast thou\ndone?  And why hast thou put me to shame among the Muslim nobles?”  And he said unto\nthem, “I am a Christian, and I believe in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Living God,\nthe Most High; blessed be His Name!”  Immediately he had said this they punished him\nvery severely, and they cast him into a dark pit, and he remained there for seven days and\nseven nights without food and drink, and they poured urine upon him and cast the filth\nfrom their houses on him.  And his mother wept over him day and night, and by reason of\nher excessive weeping they drove away the young man, and he departed to the desert of\nScete, and he dwelt in the desert of Abba Macarius for a period of two years, and he\nfought a strenuous fight, and devoted himself to the ascetic life.  After this a certain monk\nsaid unto him, “Would it not be profitable to thee without [delay] to go to the city of Mesr\n(Cairo) and proclaim thy Faith openly?”  And he rose up and went to Mesr (Cairo), and\nhis father seized him and took him to King Hakem, who is called “Governor” (i.e.\nKhalifah), and he said unto him, “Our son hath forsaken the Muslim faith, and hath\nentered the Christian Faith.”  And the Khalifah said unto the young man, “Is this true what\nthey say about thee?”  And he told the Khalifah what had happened to him in Mecca, and\nhow Saint Mercurius had appeared unto him, and how he had seated him with himself on\nhis horse, and how he had brought him into his shrine in the twinkling of an eye and had\ntaken him into the church of Mesr (Cairo), and how he had seen the picture of the saint in\nthe church, and how he knew that it was he who had appeared unto him in the desert.  And\nwhen Hakem the Khalifa, the infidel, heard this he spoke many words and he feared with\na great fear.  And he said unto the young man, “What dost thou want?”  And he said unto\nhim, “I ask thee to give me authority to build a church in the name of Saint Mercurius the\nmartyr”; and the Khalifah gave him authority to build a church there in the name of\nMichael the archangel, and he built a second church--in the name of Mercurius the martyr,\nand great signs and wonders took place therein.  And he composed two books, one on the\nGrace of God and the gift of the Holy Spirit, and the other on the True Faith.  And he\nvanquished in debate the wicked, and the pagans, and the Muslims, and he pleased God\nand died in peace.  Now the name of this young man was “John,” which was given to him\nwhen they baptized him.  All this took place through the prayer of Saint Mercurius the\nmartyr, and the multitude of his miracles.  Salutation to Mercurius of Rome, who rode a\nblack horse.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Acarius and Romanus.\nAnd on this day died Sabla Wangel, Queen of Ethiopia.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

And when he\nshone brightly and became strong in the Divine Grace he taught his sister Tatbusya, and\nshe was baptized with Christian baptism.  And Saint Pelarianus fought a great spiritual\nfight, and at length the angels would come and visit him always, and they would reveal\nunto him everything, which he wanted [to know], and they would teach him concerning\nhidden things before they came to pass.  When Diocletian the infidel reigned he inflicted\npersecution upon the Christians, and tortured them, and he slew many of them and they\nbecame martyrs.   Now this holy man and his sister used to go round and take up the\nbodies of the martyrs and prepare them for burial, and bury them.  And a certain evil man\nhaving learned concerning them went and accused them to Masius, the emperor’s friend,\nand the emperor commanded his soldiers to bring them to him.  When they arrived they\nstood up and he questioned them concerning their Faith, and they confessed that they were\nChristians and did not deny it.  And he promised them very many things if they would\ndeny our Lord Jesus Christ, and worship idols, but they would not listen to his commands,\nand they did not want his promised gifts.  And the emperor loved them and he said unto\nthem, “If ye will not hearken unto me, and will not sacrifice to my gods, I will torture you\nwith very many kinds of torture”; and they were not afraid of his tortures.   When the\ngovernor saw their endurance and fortitude, he delivered them over to the headsman to cut\noff their heads.  And when they had cut off their heads, those who were standing there saw\nshining angels meeting their souls with great joy.  When the emperor saw this he believed\nin our Lord Christ.  And the emperor shut the governor up in prison for three days, and on\nthe fourth day he had him brought out from the prison house and ordered the headsman to\ncut off his head; and [he did so] and the saint received the crown of martyrdom in the\nkingdom of the heavens with Pelarianus, and his wife Kilkeya, and his sister Tatbusya. \nSalutation to Pelarianus who buried the bodies of the martyrs, and to his wife Kilkeya and\nhis sister Tatbusya.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated Gregory, Bishop of the island of Nusis (Nyssa). \nSalutation to Gregory, Bishop of the city (sic) of Nusis (Nyssa).\nAnd on this day also the men of Nagran and Saint Khirut their father were martyred in the\nfifth year of the reign of the Emperor Justinus, when Abba John was Archbishop of\nJerusalem, and Abba Timothy was Archbishop of Alexandria, and Abba Timothy was\nArchbishop of Constantinople, and Euphrasius was Archbishop of Antioch, and Caleb the\nrighteous was King of Ethiopia.  And in those days there reigned in Saba a Jew whose\nname was Phinehas, and he was an infidel and a man of iniquity, and one who shed the\nblood of men.  In ancient times the country of Saba was under the rule of the Kings of\nEthiopia, and the Roman Emperors Vespasian and Titus having driven out the Jews\nsubsequently inherited it.  And by the side of the country of Saba was a very great city\nwherein lived very many believers and men who confessed Jesus Christ.  And there came\nthat Jewish king to destroy the holy and Christ-loving city, and to plunder the houses of\nthe Christians.  When he came to the city he saw the sign of the Cross all round on the\nwalls thereof, and upon the gates and ramparts thereof were standing large numbers of\n\nmighty men of war, and the heart of the Jewish king was filled with rage.  And he wished\nto go into the city but was unable to find any means of so doing, because God had\nstrengthened it, but he slew the slaves who were working the ground, and whom he found\noutside the city, and he carried off their children into captivity, and gave them over to\nforced labors.  And that Jew who was as foul as Diablos, the Adversary, sent a message to\nthe men [in the city] saying, “I swear unto you by the Name of the Lord God, and by the\nTorah, and by the prophets, that I do not wish to do you any harm, and I do not wish to ill-\ntreat any man of this city, and I do not wish to shed one drop of blood.  But I want to see\nthe buildings of the city, and the broad spaces thereof, and the marketplaces”; and the\npeople of the city believed his word.  Then Khirut, and son of Ka’ab, said, “Do not believe\nthe word of this infidel Jew, for he is a man of iniquity, and do not open the gates”; and\nthe people refused to listen to him and they opened the gates.  As soon as the Jew had\nentered the city he commanded [his men] first of all to plunder the goods of the men of the\ncity, and to light a fire so large that its flame reached unto heaven.  Then he commanded\nthem to bring to him Abba Paul, Bishop of the city, and when they told him that he was\ndead, he made them bring the bishop’s bones out of the grave and had them burned in the\nfire.  Then he assembled the priests, and the deacons, and the monks, and the widows and\nthose who were being taught, who passed day and night in reading the Holy Scriptures. \n[All] these he cast into the fire, and they were in number four hundred and twenty-six\nsouls.  Now he wanted to frighten the Christians by this act.  Then he commanded his men\nto put a collar round the neck of Saint Khirut, and to load his hands and feet with fetters;\nand he fettered also all the nobles and chief men of the city.  And he commanded a crier to\ngo through all the city, crying, “Whosoever will not deny Christ shall die an evil death.” \nWhen the holy Christians heard this they cried out, saying, “Far be it from us!  We will\nnot do this thing.  We will not deny Christ our God; in Whom we have believed, and in\nWhose Name we have been baptized.”  When that filthy Jew heard this he killed men and\nwomen, young men and maidens, and babes and old men, in all four thousand four\nhundred and fifty-two souls.  And as for the remaining women he commanded his soldiers\nto cut off their heads with the sword; now they were in number two hundred and twenty-\nseven souls.  And then he seized Saint Demaha, the daughter of Rabe’a, the wife of Saint\nKhirut.  Now this woman was very beautiful, as were her two daughters, and the sun had\nnever touched them except when they sat in the verandah of their house.  And they stood\nbefore the [Jew] king, and he was unable to persuade them by means of his crafty\npromises to deny their Faith; and when they refused he commanded his soldiers to strip\noff their veils, and the women of the city wept for them.  And one of her two daughters,\nthe younger, a maiden of twelve winters, spat in the face of the king; and a soldier who\nsaw her drew his sword and cut off her head and the head of her sister.  Then the filthy\nJew commanded his soldiers to make Saint Demaha to drink the blood of her daughters,\nand as she tasted it she said, “I thank Thee, O my Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the Living\nGod, that Thou hast made Thine handmaiden taste the blood of the Offering of her\ndaughters.”  And the king commanded them to cut off her head with the sword, and she\nfinished her martyrdom there.   Then the king commanded them to bring to him Saint\nKhirut, and those who were with him in the prison house; and they were in number three\nhundred and forty men.  And the Jew tried to force Saint Khirut to abandon his Faith, but\nthe saint answered and said, “Eight and seventy years have I served my Lord Jesus Christ,\nand I have come to the fourth generation.  And this day I shall rejoice if I become a martyr\nand if I die for His holy Name.  I did tell the people not to put any confidence in thine\noath, and that thou wast a liar, but they would not believe my words.  Moreover, it is the\ngood pleasure of Christ that hath brought me into this fight.”  When the Jew king heard\nthis he was furiously angry, and he commanded his soldiers to take him into the valley and\nto cut off his head there.  When Saint Khirut heard this he prayed to God to strengthen the\nempire of Rome and the kingdom of Ethiopia so that they might destroy the kingdom of\nthe filthy Jew.  And he blessed the people and embraced them, and then the soldiers cut off\nthe head of the saints.  And there was there a certain woman, who was a Christian, and she\nhad a child of five winters, and she took some of the blood of the saints and smeared\nherself and her son therewith.  And when the soldiers saw this they carried them bound to\nthe king, and he threw the woman into the fire, but the Jew took the boy and he said unto\nhim, “Dost thou love me or Him that is called Christ?”  And the boy said, “I love Christ,\n\nand I am the slave of Him only; let me go that I may depart to my mother.”  And when the\nJew held him fast the child bit his foot, and the king snatched him up and cast him into the\nfire and he became a martyr.  And they also brought a woman who was carrying a child\nten months old, and his mother said unto him, “I cannot give thee to this fire”; and the\nchild said unto her, “O my mother, let us depart quickly into everlasting life; we shall only\nsee this fire to-day,” and they cast the woman into the fire with her son.  And [the king]\nsaw his soldiers fighting against the Christians and destroying them, some by means of\nfire, and others with the edge of the sword until at length all companions of the Jews were\nexhausted.  Then there appeared in the heavens a fire, which filled the whole sky for forty\ndays and forty nights.   And when the Jew king had entered into his city he sent\nmessengers unto the [neighboring] kings boasting of his valor.  When Justinus, Emperor\nof Rome, heard this, he sent a letter to Timothy, Archbishop of Alexandria, calling upon\nhim to send instructions to Caleb, King of Ethiopia, to make war on that Jew, and to\navenge the blood of the people of Nagran.  When Caleb, the King of Ethiopia, heard this,\nhe departed into the country of the Jew king with many soldiers, and many ships, having\nreceived the blessing of Abba Pantaleon of the Cell.  Having arrived in the country he\ndestroyed all the city of the King of Saba, and he left nothing therein, neither man nor\nbeast.   And he rebuilt the city of Nagran, and established the commemoration of the\nmartyrs thereof.  And he sent glad tidings to Justinus, Emperor of Rome, and to Timothy,\nthe Archbishop, and there was great joy, and they gave thanks unto Christ.  Salutation to\nthe bright Stars of Nagran who have illumined all the world.\nAnd on this day also died Saint Iyasus Mo’a, and on it Gelyos, and Mayen, Mekwas, and\nMaryales are commemorated.  Salutation to Iyasus Mo’a, who for forty years never slept\non his side.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and for this\nreason his heart inclined towards Saint James, and he made him worship the sun and fire. \nWhen his mother and his wife and his sister heard that he had become one with the king in\nhis acts and in his faith, they wrote him a letter, saying, “Why hast thou forsaken the Faith\nof our Lord Jesus Christ, and dost worship natural objects which have been created, that is\nto say, the sun, and the moon, and fire?  Know that if thou dost continue to hold the faith\nof the King of Persia, we shall become strangers to thee.”  When he had read their letter\nhe wept bitterly, and he said, “If I continue to be of this opinion I shall become a stranger\nto my mother, and to my household and kinsfolk.  But, however, how can I approach my\nLord Jesus Christ?”  And he began to read Christian books, and he wept and forsook the\nservice of the king.  And certain men told the king and spoke unto him, saying, “Behold\nthy friend James hath forsaken thy service and thy love, and the worship of the gods.” \nAnd the king sent a messenger to bring him to him, and when he had come he set him\nbefore the king, and the king said unto him, “Why hast thou forsaken my service?”  And\nSaint James said unto him, “Our Lord Christ says in the gospel, ‘whosoever confesses Me\nbefore men, him I will confess before my Father Who is in heaven.  Whosoever denies Me\nbefore the face of men, him will I deny before the angels of God’ (Matthew x, 32). \nTherefore have I left thy service, and thy love, and the worship of thy gods, and I worship\nmy Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Living God, the Creator of the heavens, and the\nearth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the seas.”  When the king heard this he\nwas exceedingly wroth, and he commanded his guards to beat him very severely, and they\ndid so until his blood ran down on the ground like water; but he could not turn from his\ngood counsel.  And the king commanded them to cut off his members with knives, and\nthey cut off the ten fingers of his hands and the ten toes of his feet, and his arms.  And\nthey cut him up into thirty-two separate pieces, and as each piece was chopped off, he\nsang and glorified God, saying, “O God of the Christians, my Lord and King Jesus Christ,\nreceive Thou the branches of the tree according to the greatness of Thy compassion. \nWhen the master of the vineyard prunes the vines he leaves slips behind him, and these\nsprout in the month of Nesan, that is to say Miyazya (April-May), and the vine puts forth\n[new] roots and spreads abroad.”  When only the head, and breast, and loins of the holy\nman were left, and he knew he was nigh to the giving up of his soul, at that moment he\nprayed to God for the world, and for the people therein, and that He would teach them and\nhave compassion upon them.  And he said, “There is left to me neither limb nor hand\nwhich I can lift up to Thee, O Lord; behold my limbs have been cast away before me, O\nLord receive my soul.”  And straightway our Lord Jesus Christ appeared unto him and\ncomforted him, and strengthened him, and immediately his soul rejoiced and was glad. \nAnd before he delivered up his soul one of the guards made haste, and cut of his head with\na sharp sword, and Saint James received the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the\nheavens, and he depart to the habitation of light, to Christ Who loved him.  And certain\nGod-fearing men took his body and made it ready for burial and wrapped it in costly\ncloths, and they laid it in a pure place.  When his mother and his wife and his sister heard\nthat he had become a martyr they rejoiced with great joy, and they came to the place\nwhere his body was, and they embraced it and wept over it, and laid splendid cloths over\nit and sweet scents and unguents.  When the days of Saints Honorius and Arcadius and\nother kings arrived, they built in his honor churches, and monasteries and nunneries. \nWhen the King of Persia heard the report of those monasteries, and the stories of the\n\nmartyrs and their bodies, and what great signs and wonders had appeared through them in\nevery place, he commanded his soldiers to burn the martyrs’ bodies in every place with\nfire, and not to allow anything of them to remain in the country of his dominion.  And\ncertain believing men came and carried away the body of the saint, and they carried it and\nbrought it to Jerusalem, and deposited it there.  And then they brought it to Peter, Bishop\nof the city of Roha (Edessa), and it remained with him until Marcianus reigned, and then\nSaint Peter took it and brought it to the country of Egypt, and deposited it in the city of\nBehensa, where it remained for a few days with certain brethren.  And whilst these men\nwere praying at mid-day, and the body of Saint James was in their midst, straightway\nSaint James appeared with many of the martyrs of Persia, arrayed in Persian apparel; and\nthey sang with them, and they blessed them, and then they disappeared.  And before they\ndisappeared from their sight Saint James said unto them, “My body shall stay here even as\nGod commanded.”  After this Saint Peter the bishop wished to return to his own country,\nand he took the body of Saint James with him, and he carried it to the sea and laid it in a\nship, but the voice of Saint James went round about, saying, “My body shall stay here.” \nAnd straightway the body of Saint James was snatched out of their hands, and returned to\nthe place wherein it had been, even as God commanded; and great signs and wonders took\nplace through the body of Saint James.  Salutation to Saint James who was cut up into\nthirty-two pieces.\nAnd on this day also Saint Timothy, a native of Banhor, became a martyr.  This holy man\nwas a fearer of God from his youth, and he devoted himself to fasting and prayer.  He had\na wife whose name was Mora, the daughter of his father’s brother, and she was very\nbeautiful, and she gave him pleasure by all her works and they lived together for many\ndays in love and happiness.  Whilst they were living in this state of quietness the Imperial\nEdict of the wicked Diocletian went forth into all the countries of his Empire ordering the\nheathen temples to be opened and the churches to be closed.  When Saint Timothy heard\nthis he rejoiced exceedingly, for he had been waiting for this time, and he told his wife\nwhat he was going to do; and she said, “God’s Will be done.”  Then he rose up and prayed\nto God to prosper his way, and as he was sleeping that night our Lord Jesus Christ\nappeared unto him, and He said, “Peace be unto thee, O My beloved Timothy, behold I\nhave numbered thee among the number of the righteous.  Rise up now, and take thy wife,\nand go to the city of Behensa, and confess the Name of Christ before all the people who\nworship idols.”  When he awoke he told his wife what he had seen, and she told him that\nshe had dreamed even so.   Then they rose up together and came to Quilquilianus, the\ngovernor, and they found him celebrating a festival with singers and dancers who were\nperforming before him.  Then the soldiers seized Timothy and set him before him, and his\nwife was following him.  And the governor spoke unto him with gentle and persuasive\nwords and tried to make him worship idols, but the saint reviled him and his foul faith;\ntherefore was the governor angry and he commanded them to cast him into prison.  After a\nfew days the governor had him and his wife brought out and beaten with whips until their\nblood ran down on the ground like water; and his wife finished her strife under this\ntorture.  And Saint Timothy he treated with gentleness because he wished to make him\nagree to worship idols.  And when he refused to do so the governor had the saint’s body\nsmeared with oil and grease, and cast him into a red-hot fiery furnace.  And whilst the\nholy man was in the fire Gabriel, an angel of God, came down to him from heaven, and\ndelivered him from this torture.  Then the governor cast the saint into the prison house a\nsecond time, where he wrought many signs and wonders.  One day whilst he was praying\nthere our Lord Jesus Christ came to him, and made a covenant with him and gave him\npeace.  And on the following day the governor had him brought out of the prison house,\nand they took him to the city of Zanhus, and they cut off his holy head.  Thereupon an\nearthquake took place, and the air was filled with angels, and the men of the city came and\nprepared him for burial in a splendid manner and buried him.   When the time of\npersecution had passed they built a church for him, and consecrated it on the seven and\ntwentieth day of the month of Sane (June-July), and they laid his holy body in it. \nSalutation to Timothy and to his wife Mora.\n\nAnd on this day also is commemorated Saint Philemon the apostle, who was one of the\nSeventy-two disciples.   Salutation to thy tongue with its eloquent words and pleasant\nspeech, thou father of the city (or country) of Lydia.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated ‘Al’are, and Abba Takla Hawaryat of Gabrema,\nand Clement the martyr of ‘Endabergoy of Rebotch (or Zarbatch).  Salutation to Takla\nHawaryat.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

Now the bishop of the city was\npondering what he should do about him, and our Lady Mary appeared unto him and told\nhim to depart to the city of Alexandria, to the Archbishop Abba Theonas.  And as he was\ngoing thither, the angel of the Lord was in the form of a prince, and he informed the\narchbishop about Sarapamon.  When he had come to him the archbishop taught him the\npath of God, and he baptized him with holy Christian baptism.  Then Sarapamon became a\nmonk in the monastery of Abba Severus, which is outside the city of Alexandria.  When\nthe Archbishop Theonas died, and Abba Peter was appointed to succeed him, he sent and\nbrought this holy man Sarapamon to him, to help him in the work of the archiepiscopate. \nAfter this he appointed him Bishop of the city of Nakyanos, and the churches rejoiced in\nhim greatly, and God wrought very many signs and wonders by his hands.  And nigh unto\nhis city there were idols, which certain of the people therein used to worship, and he used\nto ask God to destroy them.  And God accepted his petition, for the earth swallowed them\nup and the waters of the sea rose up over them and covered them; and through his prayer\nGod destroyed the idols that were in his diocese, and He crushed the blasphemy of\nSibellius who made the Father and the Son, and the Holy Spirit one Person (or\nSubstance).   And when Diocletian denied Christ certain people told him, saying,\n“Sarapamon is destroying the worship of the idols which are the king’s gods”; and having\nheard very many complaints he commanded his soldiers to bring Sarapamon to him, and\nthey did so.  When Saint Sarapamon arrived in the city of Alexandria with the messengers\nof the emperor, Abba Peter the archbishop came to him, and there were many clergy with\nhim, and embraced him, and he saw his face as it were the face of an angel of God.  And\nwhen he came to the Emperor Diocletian had him tortured with various tortures, and our\nLord Jesus Christ raised him up sound and whole, and uninjured and without suffering;\nand many people believed because of him.  Now the emperor was afraid to add to his\ntortures lest the multitudes should believe through him.  And he sent him away into Upper\nEgypt, to Arianus, the governor of Antinoe, so that he might torture him there and cut off\nhis head with the sword.   Now at that time Arianus was governor of the city of\nAlexandria.  And Arianus took Saint Sarapamon with him in a ship to go to Upper Egypt,\nand when the ship reached Nakyos his city, it ran aground and it was impossible to\nremove it from where it stood.  And Arianus had Saint Sarapamon brought up from inside\nthe ship, and carried him to the north of the city, and they cut off his head with the sword,\nand he received the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  And the people\ntook his body with great honor, and carried it to the church and laid it therein, and through\nit very many signs and miracles were wrought there.   Salutation to Sarapamon before\nwhom the lions bowed when they saw thy face, which was the image of that of the\nCreator.\nAnd on this day is commemorated Abba Likanos the priest, who fought a spiritual fight in\nthe monastery of Kuonasel, in the country of Ethiopia.  Salutation to Abba Likanos, from\nwhose fingers burning lamps shot forth.\n\nSalutation to Abraham the faithful man, and to Isaac the offering, and to Jacob who\nanointed the stone with oil, in whose bosoms live the righteous, like dates on the palm tree\nand clusters of grapes on the vine.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and he was the last of the martyrs.  The father of this holy man was the high\npriest of the city of Alexandria, and his name was Theodore; the name of his mother was\nSophia.  And they were fearers of God and they had no children at all.  And on the fifth\nday of the month Hamle (July-Aug.), the day of the festival of Peter and Paul the apostles,\nthe mother of the holy man saw many Christians with their children, and they wore festal\napparel with decorations, and they were going to church; and she was exceedingly\nsorrowful.  And she went into the church and stood up before the altar of the saint, and she\nbesought our Lord Christ with many tears to give her a son.  And that night Peter and Paul\nthe apostles appeared unto her, and they said unto her, “Behold God hath accepted thy\npetition, and He will assuredly give thee a son, and thou shall call his name ‘Peter’”; and\nthey commanded her to go to the Archbishop Theonas that the people might pray for her. \nAnd after certain days she brought forth this holy man, and she called his name “Peter”. \nWhen his days were seven years she gave him to the archbishop even as [Hannah gave]\nSamuel the prophet to Eli, and he became to him like a beloved son; and the archbishop\nmade him a reader, and after that he made him a deacon, and after that he made him a\npriest.   And he used to help the archbishop in all his divers good works and in his\nadministration of the churches.   When Abba Theonas was dying he commanded the\nbishops and priests to appoint Abba Peter archbishop in his place, and they appointed him\nArchbishop of the city of Alexandria; and when he was appointed all the people and all\nthe churches rejoiced.  And it came to pass in the days of Diocletian, the infidel emperor,\nthat there lived in the city of Alexandria a certain judge who was of the same opinion as\nthe emperor, and who worshipped idols with him, and he had two sons.  And his wife was\na Christian, but she was unable to have her sons baptized with Christian baptism in the\ncity of Antioch, and she therefore took them and embarked on a ship in order to come to\nAlexandria.  As they were journeying over the sea, a violent storm rose up against them,\nand she was afraid that her two sons would die without baptism.  And she cut her breasts,\nand made the sign of the Cross with her blood, which she smeared over the foreheads of\nher sons, and she dipped them in the sea three times in the Name of the Father and the Son\nand the Holy Ghost.  Then a great calm came, and they were saved from drowning and\narrived in the city of Alexandria.  And she brought her sons to the Archbishop Abba Peter\nso that he might baptize them with Christian baptism, together with the sons of the men of\nAlexandria.  And when the archbishop wished to immerse her boys, the water congealed\nand became as hard as a stone; and he tried to immerse them three times, and each time\nthe water became like a stone.   And the archbishop marveled and asked her what had\nhappened, and she related to him how a wind storm had risen up at sea, and how she had\ncut her breasts, and how she had signed the foreheads of her sons with the sign of the\nCross with her blood, and how she had immersed them in the sea three times in the Name\nof the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost.   When the archbishop heard this he\nmarveled exceedingly and praised God, saying, “Thus says the Church; as one is baptism\neven so one is the Church.”  And in the days of this father Archbishop Abba Peter one\nArius, a heretic, rose up, and the saint rebuked him but he would not hearken to his words;\nand having rebuked him many times and Arius having refused to turn from his wicked\nopinion, Abba Peter anathematized him and excommunicated him.   And when the\nEmperor Diocletian heard the report of this Saint Peter, and that he was teaching the\nmultitudes everywhere not to worship the gods, he sent messengers to him to seize Saint\nPeter and to shut him up in prison.  And when the men of the city knew this straightway\nthey took their weapons of war with them and they came to the prison house to fight the\n\nmessengers of the emperor.  And when Saint Peter saw that there was going to be a great\ntumult on his account, he wished to yield up his soul to death for his people, and he\nwanted to be released from this world and to be with Christ.  And he made all the people\ncome to him, and he comforted them and commended them to be strong in the True Faith. \nWhen Arius knew that the blessed Peter was departing to God and leaving him under the\nban of excommunication, he went to the great high priests, and told them to beseech the\nblessed Peter on his behalf, so that he might release him from the ban of\nexcommunication; but when the chief priests entreated the blessed Peter on behalf of\nArius, he added to the ban of excommunication which he had laid upon him.  And he said\nunto them, “I have seen a vision this night, and behold our Lord Jesus Christ was standing\nwith His rent raiment.  And I said unto Him, My Lord, ‘Who hath rent Thy raiment?’  And\nHe said unto me, ‘Arius hath rent My raiment; he separated Me from My Father.  Beware\nof him.’”  Then Saint Peter commanded Arkilas (Archelaus) and Alexander, and said unto\nthem, “Ye will have to appoint an archbishop after me; beware of Arius, and have no\nfellowship with him in the work of the priesthood, and release him not from the ban of\nexcommunication, for he is the enemy of Christ.  And thou ‘Arkilas (Archelaus) shall be\narchbishop after me and before Alexander, and thou shalt meet Arius and shalt die\nspeedily.”  After this the blessed Peter took counsel with the messengers of the emperor\n(sic) in secret that they might bring him out from the inside of the prison house, and they\ndug opposite to it and took him out and finished the emperor’s command.  And they did as\nhe commanded them, and they took him and brought him outside the city, [to the place]\nwhere was the grave of the blessed Mark the evangelist.   [The text of this passage is\ncorrupt.]  And Saint Peter prayed and committed his people to the care of God, and he\nprayed again, saying, “O my Lord Christ, let the shedding of my blood be the end of the\nworship of idols, and may they be brought to naught and perish throughout the world.” \nAnd a voice came from heaven, saying, “Amen!  It shall be according as thou sayest”, and\na certain virgin who was near that place heard these words.  And Saint Peter said unto the\nsoldiers of the emperor, “Finish what ye have been commanded to do”; and straightway\nthey cut off his holy head with the sword and he received the crown of martyrdom in the\nkingdom of the heavens.  And his body stood upright for a space of two hours.  And the\npeople made haste and went out from the city, for they were by the prison house and they\ndid not know what had become of the saint until one told them what had happened.  And\nthey took the body of their shepherd and their chief and made it ready for burial, and they\nbrought it to the city and took it into the church, and laid it upon his seat on which no one\nhad ever once seen him sit, even as he told them.  And when they asked him, saying,\n“Why dost thou not sit upon thy throne?” he answered and said unto them, “I see the\npower of God sitting upon it, and therefore I do not dare to sit upon it.”   Then they\nfinished making him ready for the grave, and they laid his body with the bodies of the\nchosen saints, the archbishops.   And he sat upon the throne of Mark the evangelist\nfourteen years, and he was appointed archbishop in the tenth year of the reign of\nDiocletian.  And many signs and mighty wonders took place through his body.  Salutation\nto Peter, the preacher of the Faith, the counterpart of Paul.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated the Birth of our Lord and God and Redeemer,\nJesus Christ, of the holy two-fold Virgin Mary, our Lady.  Salutation to Thy Birth, O Thou\nWho didst show to Peter Thy raiment, which Arius had rent.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated the forty-seven thousand martyrs who suffered in\nthe time of the Emperor Diocletian.  Salutation to the righteous men who fought against\nDiocletian.  [This paragraph is wanting in the Bodleian MS.]\nAnd on this day also became a martyr the great Saint Clement, Archbishop of the city of\nRome.  This holy man was a royal kinsman, and was the son of Caustus, the captain of the\narmy of the Emperor of Rome; his excellent and honorable parents taught him all the\nvarious kinds of learning and the philosophy of the Greeks.  And when Peter the apostle\npreached in Rome the preaching of the Gospel, Caustus the father of Clement believed\nthrough this holy man that our Lord Jesus Christ was truly [God], and he gave all his\ngoods to the poor and needy.  And when his father went to the emperor he remained many\n\ndays, and the brother of the holy man Caustus thought that he would marry his wife. \nWhen the mother of the holy man knew this, she took Clement and his younger brother\nand embarked on a ship, to go to Athens, and to have her sons taught philosophy and\nlearning until their father returned from the emperor.  And straightway a violent storm\nrose up against them, and the ship was smashed, and one after another clung to one of the\ntimbers, and the waves of the sea washed this holy Clement to the city of Alexandria,\nwhere he remained a few days.  And God called Peter the apostle and said unto him, “Get\nthee to the city of Alexandria so that thou mayest find the servants who are fit for mercy.” \nAnd when Peter the apostle came to the city of Alexandria, and preached the preaching of\nthe Gospel therein, no man in the city of Alexandria believed except this holy man\nClement.  When, however, he heard the preaching of Peter the apostle he believed on our\nLord Jesus Christ, and Peter baptized him with Christian baptism, and explained to him\nthe Godhead of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the riches and glory of those who worship Him,\nand how signs and wonders are wrought [in His Name].  And from that day Clement\nfollowed Peter the apostle, and he became his disciple, and he wrote the “Contendings of\nthe Apostles,” and what happened to them with infidel kings.  Then he preached in many\ncities, and the apostles gave unto him the Books of the Canon to proclaim, and then he\nwas appointed Archbishop of the city of Rome.  And he preached therein, and converted\nvery many people thereof to the knowledge of God.  And the Emperor Trajan, the infidel,\nheard of him, and he sent his guards to seize him and bring him before him, and the\nemperor said unto him, “Worship the idols and deny Christ.”  And when Clement would\nnot hearken unto his command he sent him away to a certain city to be tortured, for he\nwas afraid of the men of the city of his kinsfolk, and he did not want to torture him where\nhe was lest the people should rise up against him.  So he sent him away to the governor of\nthat city and ordered him to torture him with many tortures.  And that governor hung\nround the neck of the holy man Clement a heavy iron implement with four feet (anchor),\nwhich is placed in ships, and he cast him into the sea.  And he delivered up his soul into\nthe hand of God, and he received the crown of martyrdom like the apostles who preached. \nAnd it came to pass that when a full year had passed he was seen in the sea, and the body\nof Saint Clement appeared, and he was preaching in the depths of the sea just as if he were\nalive.  And the people came and were blessed by him, and they wished to carry him off,\nand they brought a splendid stone coffer, and laid him in it, and they wished to take him\nup and bring him out of the sea, but they were unable to move him from his place.  And\nthey knew that he was unwilling to come out of the sea and they left him there, and\ndeparted. And each year, on the day of his festival, an opening appears in the box above\nhis body, and the people come and are blessed by him.  And many believing men who\nhave seen this have described and written down accounts of some of his miracles, such as\nthe following.  One year certain men came to be blessed by him, and when they went forth\nfrom him they forgot a little child who was behind the coffer of Saint Clement.  This\nhappened by the Will of our Lord Jesus Christ, so that He might reveal their work to His\nsaints and friends, and the grace, which they receive from Him.  And when they had\ngathered together above the sea, they sought for the father [of the child] and found him\nnot.  And they thought that he was dead and that the beasts, which are in the sea, had\ndevoured him, and they wept for him, and they celebrated his commemoration, and they\nconsecrated the Offering and offered up incense according to their custom.  And when the\nsecond year had arrived and the time had come for the sea to open itself again, certain\nmen who came according to their custom, found the child alive and standing up by the\nside of the coffer of Clement.  And they asked him, saying, “How didst thou exist and on\nwhat didst thou live?”  And he said unto them, “Saint Clement gave me food to eat and\ndrink, and God preserved me from the wild beasts of the sea.”  And when they heard this\nthey marveled exceedingly and they praised God Who is to be praised and glorified above\nall His saints and martyrs who have contended for His holy Name’s sake.  Salutation to\nClement the author of the “Contendings of the Apostles”.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

And He raised him up\nsound and uninjured.  There was a certain sister, a virgin, a ministrant in the church of our\nLady Mary, and she had two brothers, one of whom was called John and the other Isaac. \nAnd they came to the holy man whilst he was in prison, and they wept before him, saying,\n“Thou hast been a father to us in the place of our own father.  Why wilt thou go and leave\nus widows and orphans?”  And the holy man comforted them, and sent them back to their\nhouses.  And Julius advised the governor, saying, “Write down the story of the fight of this\nelder, and be at peace.”  And he accepted his words, and commanded his men to cut off the\nhead of Abba Makarawi, and they cut off his head with a sword, and he receive the crown\nof martyrdom in the kingdom of heaven.  And the blessed Julius took his holy body, and\nprepared it for burial, and swathed it in splendid wrappings embroidered in gold, and he\nlaid a cross of gold on his breast, and sent it with his slaves to the city of Nikyos.  There\nwas a fair wind, and the boat sailed swiftly, and it came and stopped by the gate of the city\n‘Esmun Zerays; and the sailors wished to move the boat, but they were unable to do so. \nAnd when they had toiled hard, a voice went forth from the body of the holy elder, saying,\n“This is the place wherein God is pleased that my body shall rest.”  And they made this\nknown to the people of the city, who went out to it, carrying palm branches; and they\ncarried it in with great reverence and laid it in their city.  And all the days of his life were\none hundred and thirty-one years.  Of these he passed eight years in learning the Books of\nthe Holy Church, and he spent twenty-four years in completing his knowledge of the\nordinances of the office of deacon.  Then he was appointed priest, and held this office of\nthirty years.  After this he was consecrated bishop, and he held this office for sixty-nine\n\nyears.  And he finished his good fight, and received the crown of life from our Lord Jesus\nChrist.\nAnd on this day also died Gregory, the seer of things hidden, of the city of Roha\n(Eddessa).  This Gregory was in his early life a sinner, and a man of violence.  Then he\nturned to God, and became a monk, and he contended strenuously until God showed him\nthe abode of the righteous, and their abundant joy, and the sufferings and tortures of each\nof the damned.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

When Satan saw him fighting the good fight, he did not\nleave him unhated, on the contrary, he contrived to bring great sorrow upon him, through\nhis own act, in consecrating as Bishop of the country of Ethiopia a man whose name was\nPeter.  Now the bishop, Abba Peter, arrived in Ethiopia, and after he had been sitting a few\ndays, the King of Ethiopia fell sick.  And he summoned the bishop, Abba Peter, to his\npresence, and brought his two sons before him, and taking the royal crown off his own\nhead, he gave it to the bishop, Abba Peter, and said unto him, “Behold, I am going to my\nLord Jesus Christ, to Whom be glory!  And behold, my two sons are before thee.  After my\ndeath appoint as king the one of them which thou knowest would rule the kingdom best.” \nWhen the King of Ethiopia was dead, the bishop, and the governors, and the generals, and\nthe royal army, took counsel together, and it was said among them, “The younger son will\nbe far better for the kingdom than the elder.”  And the bishop appointed the younger son to\nbe king, and seated him upon the royal throne for a few days.  In those days Satan entered\ninto the heart of two monks from the country of Syria, and they went about from one place\nto another until they came to the monastery of Abba Antonius, and they dwelt therein for a\nfew days, but were driven out because of the evil of their works.  And the two of them\nmade an agreement together, that one of them should be made a bishop, and that the other\nshould assist his companion.  And they rose up, and came to the country of Ethiopia, and\nthey forged lying documents which they carried with them, and these documents declared\nthat the two monks had come from father Abba Cosmas, Archbishop of the city of\nAlexandria.  And they went on to say, “We have heard that there hath cone unto you a\ncertain man whose name is Peter, and that he hath made himself bishop.  Now we have not\nconsecrated him, and we have not sent him to you; on the contrary, he is an impostor. \nNow as concerneth the man who shall come to you with this letter, and whose name is\nMinas, he is in truth a bishop.  We have consecrated him and we send him to you.”  And\nthe monks wrote also in that document, saying, “Peter, the false bishop, hath crowned king\nthe younger prince, and hath set aside the elder prince, which thing is not right; Peter is a\nman of iniquity.”  And these two false and wicked monks, Minas and Victor, before they\nwrote the forged letter came to Peter, the bishop, and asked him to give them gold, but he\nwould not give them anything whatsoever.  And Satan taught them how to carry out this\nfoul and wicked work, and they took the forged letters to the elder prince, who was sitting\nby himself in a certain place, and a few men were waiting upon him.  When he had read\nthese forged letters he rejoiced exceedingly, and he gathered together to him a very large\nnumber of soldiers, and read the forged letters before them. And he made war upon his\nbrother, the king, and he put him in fetters and he himself reigned [in his stead].  And he\nlikewise put Peter the bishop in fetters, and carried him off to a far city, and he seated the\nimpostor Minas on the Episcopal throne in his stead.   After a few days the impostors\nMinas and Victor quarreled, and Victor stole everything there was in the bishop’s house in\nworks, which were not well pleasing unto God.  And when Cosmas the Archbishop heard\nwhat Minas, the liar, had done, he was exceedingly sorry, and he wrote a deed of expulsion\nand anathematized and excommunicated him.  When the King of Ethiopia heard this he\nwas exceedingly sorry, and he seized Minas the liar and killed him, and he sent a\nmessenger bidding Peter the bishop to return from exiled, but they found that he had died\n\nin exile.  And Cosmas the Archbishop was wroth, and he wanted to consecrate a bishop for\nthe Ethiopians, but his successors Abba Macarius, and Abba Theophanius, and Abba\nMinas, and Abba Abraham, would not do so.  And the King of Ethiopia took the assistant\nof Peter, the Bishop, and said unto him, “Sit thou instead of thy teacher, and be bishop.” \nAnd he entreated the king, saying, “It is not right for thee that I should do this, and I will\nnot transgress the Canon of the Apostles, but let me go to Egypt, and I will beseech the\narchbishop to consecrate a bishop for you, and I will return to you.”  And the king would\nnot allow him to go to the country of Egypt, but he took him against his will, and he\narrayed him in Episcopal vestments, and he performed Episcopal functions until the days\nof Abba Philotheus, the Archbishop.  And Abba Cosmas lived to a very old age, and all his\ndays were filled with peace and prosperity.   And he sat upon the throne of Mark the\nEvangelist twelve years, and he died in peace.\nAnd on this day also died Barronyos of Banyos.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

then he was appointed\nabbot of the monastery of Saint Abba John.  And he added to his works of righteousness,\nand to his ascetic labors, and he fasted and prayed and kept vigil continually, from the time\nhe became a monk until he died.  When he had held the office of chief priest for twenty\nyears, he shut himself up in the church, and up to the day of his death never saw a man\nagain.  He died fifteen years after, and during these fifteen years he never ate nor drank,\nexcept at the beginning of the Sabbath, and on the First Day of the week.  When the time\nof his death drew nigh, the angel of God appeared unto him in the desert, and gave him a\ncross of fire and said unto him, “Take this cross in thy hand.”  And the holy man said unto\nhim, “How can I hold fire in my hand?”  And the angel answered and said unto him, “Fear\nnot, for our Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom be glory, hath not given unto fire dominion over\nthee”; and he stretched out his holy hand and took the cross from the hand of the angel. \nAnd the angel said unto him, “Be strong, and received the Holy Mysteries; at the end of\nthe third day I shall come and take thee.”  And when he woke up from his sleep, he told\nthe holy elders what he had seen, and they embraced him, and wept, and entreated him to\nremember them; and on his part he entreated them to remember him always at the time of\ntheir prayers.  Then he received the Holy Mysteries and died in peace on the third day. \nAnd the holy elders who dwelt near him swathed him for burial, as was fitting, with the\nsinging of hymns, and funerary chants, and they buried him in the grave of the righteous.\nAnd on this day also Saint Eudoxia became a martyr; now her name is interpreted “Peace\nwith good will.”   This holy woman was a Samaritan, and she came from the city of\nBa’Albak, on the borders of Basri, in the neighborhood of Mount Lebanon, in the reign of\nTrabyanos (Trajan, or, Tiberius), Emperor of Rome.  Her father’s name was Yonas, and her\nmother’s name was Tababet, and in her early life she lived by prostitution and lewdness. \nAnd she used to beautify her face, and adorn her person with beautiful ornaments, so that\nshe might lead the multitude astray, and make them fall into sin with her; and by such lewd\nlife she acquired great riches.  And a certain righteous monk, of the men of Jerusalem,\nwhose name was Germanus, heard the report of her, and he visited her, disguised as one of\nthose who were in the habit of visiting her.  And when he had entered he sat down with her\nin the house, and began to rebuke her with serious and terrifying rebukes, and he reminded\nher of Gahanam, and of the worm that never sleepeth, and the outer darkness, and of each\nof the fearful punishments, which are therein.  And she answered and said unto him, “Is\nthere a resurrection of bodies after death?   After they have become dust, will they be\npunished?”  And he said unto her, “Yes.”  And she said unto him, “What is the proof of\nthis statement?  It is not written in the Law, which God gave unto Moses the prophet and\nto our fathers, and they did not believe.”  And he revealed unto her what is written in the\nOld and New Testaments concerning the resurrection of the dead, on the day of Judgment,\nand concerning the punishment of sinners, and concerning the joy of the righteous.  And\nhis words and his rebuke entered her heart, and she believed that bodies will be raised up\non the day of Judgment.  And she said unto him, “If I turn from my prostitution will God\naccept me?”  And Saint Germanus answered and said unto her, “If thou wilt believe on the\nLord Jesus Christ, to Whom be praise, and believe that He came into the world, and took\naway the sins of men by His crucifixion for their sakes, and if thou wilt repent with sincere\nrepentance from this moment, and wilt be baptized with Christian baptism, God will\naccept thee, and will not remember any of the sins which thou hast committed.  Nay, thou\nwilt become as thou wast on the day when thou wast born from thy mother’s womb, and\nthere will be opened unto thee the True Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom be\n\npraise!”  And she asked him to baptize her with Christian baptism, and he took her and\nbrought her to the Bishop of Ba’Albak.  And she confessed before him the Holy Trinity,\nand the Incarnation of the Word of God, and His Crucifixion and Resurrection.  And the\nbishop stood up and prayed over the water, so that he might baptize her with Christian\nbaptism, and God opened the eyes of her heart, and she saw a shining angel leading her to\nthe water, and other angels rejoicing and exulting for her sake.  And she saw also faces,\nwhich terrified her, and a black and horrible being who tried to drag her from them, and he\nwas wroth with her.  When she saw this sight the desire for Christian baptism increased in\nher, and she repented, and straightway she was baptized with Christian baptism.  And she\ngave all the riches, which she had collected by her sinful trade to the poor and needy, and\nshe entered one of the houses of virgins, and she put on the garb of the nun, and fought a\ngood and perfect fight.  And Satan entered into the heart of one of the men who used to\ncommit fornication with her, and he made an accusation against her to the governor, who\ncommanded that his men should bring her before him.  And when she came she stood at\nthe door of the hall, and she found in his house great lamentation and weeping, for the\ngovernor’s son, who was dead.  And she came into the house, and prayed, and entreated\nour Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom be praise! And He raised up the son of the governor from\ndeath.  When the governor saw this miracle he marveled exceedingly, and he believed on\nour Lord Jesus Christ through her, with a firm belief.  After this another governor, whose\nname was Diogenes, was appointed in his stead; and he heard the story of this virgin, and\nhad her brought before him, and she saw standing before him a certain young man, who\nwas blind of an eye, and she made prayer and supplication over him, and she made the\nsign of the Cross over the eye that was blind, and it was opened forthwith, and the young\nman saw clearly with it; and the governor sent the holy woman away.  After this another\ngovernor, whose name was Bakinikos, was appointed in the place of Diogenes.  And he\nheard that story of the holy woman Eudoxia, and had her brought to him so that he might\ntorture her.  And she besought our Lord Jesus Christ to give her a portion with the martyrs,\nand the Lord received her petition.  And the governor commanded his men to cut off her\nhead, and they cut it off with the sword; and she received the crown of martyrdom in the\nkingdom of the heavens.\nSalutation to Gabra Manfas Kedus Rabbuni who subdued lions, and made wild beasts his\nservants.\nAnd on this day also died Abuna Theodore, Abbot of Dabra Libanos; he was the fifth of\nthose who sat upon the throne of Abuna Takla Haymanot.  This father was from his youth\nup a habitation of the Holy Ghost, and he was a follower of the Law of the holy fathers\nwho were before him, and it was therefore most fitting for him to sit upon the throne of\nAbuna Takla Haymanot.  He brought his days to a close with strenuous devotion to fasting\nand prayer, and he fulfilled all the ordinances of purity even like the angels.  And he\npassed from the labor of this world to the rest, which is forever.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

And Arianus began to tell him\nabout the signs and wonders which God was working by the hands of the holy martyrs,\nand how, in spite of the tortures which he had inflicted upon them, and the cutting of their\nlimbs, they rose up again with all their natural strength and health unimpaired.   And\nDiocletian was furious with him, because of what he said, and he commanded his soldiers\nto torture him, and they tortured him severely.  Then he commanded them to cast him into\na dungeon, and to lock the door upon him until he died; and they did as he had\ncommanded.  And our Lord Jesus Christ sent an angel to him and he brought him out from\nthat dungeon, and made him to stand by the bed of the Emperor Diocletian.   And the\nemperor woke up from his sleep, and when he saw him he was afraid, and said unto him,\n“Who art thou?”  And Arianus said unto him, “I am Arianus, the governor of Antinoe.” \nAnd the emperor was terrified because of him, and he commanded his soldiers to thrust\nhim into a hair sack, and to cast him into the sea; and this they also did unto him, and\nArianus delivered up his soul into the hand of the Lord whilst he was in the hair sack.  And\nwhen Arianus was embracing his kinsfolk and his slaves, he said unto them, “The Lord\nhath informed me in a vision of the night that He will heal my body, and restore it to the\ncity of Antinoe.”  And he said unto them, “Await ye my body at the port of the city of\nAlexandria.”  And when the soldiers of Diocletian had cast his body into the sea, God\ncommanded a certain whale, and he carried the saint and brought him to the port of the\ncity of Alexandria, and laid him down on the dry beach.  And the slaves of Arianus were\nthere awaiting him, and they took his body, and brought it to his city Antinoe, and they laid\nit with the bodies of the holy martyrs Philemon and Ablanius (Apollonius).  Thus Arianus\nfinished his good fight, and received the rest of heaven.\nSalutation to the four Galatians who perished with Arianus.\nAnd on this day also Matthias the Apostle, one of the Twelve Apostles, who was appointed\nin the place of Judas Iscariot, became a martyr, having preached in the cities to which he\nhad gone, and converted the people thereof to the knowledge of God.  Before this he went\nto a city of the cannibals, whose food consisted of the bodies of the travelers who went to\nsojourn among them.   Now the custom of these men was as follows:   Whenever they\nseized a traveler, they used to put out his eyes, and then place him in the prison house,\nwriting down on paper the day on which they had seized him.  And they fed him in prison\non grass until thirty days were fulfilled, and then they would bring him out and eat him. \nWhen Matthias the Apostle came unto them, and preached among them, they seized him\nand treated him in this manner, and they put out his eyes, and shut him up in prison. \nBefore thirty days had passed over him in the prison house, God sent unto him Andrew the\nApostle, and his disciple with him, and they came unto Mathias in the prison house, and\nthey saw the abominable thing, which the men of the city did to the men who were shut up\nin the prison house.  And the men of the city knew that the apostles had come into their\ncity, and they wanted to seize them and to kill them; now it was Satan who worked upon\n\nthe men of the city to make them kill the apostles.  And the apostles made entreaty to God,\nand He made a stream of water to flow forth from under a pillar, which was in the prison\nhouse, and the water flowed out into the city, and rose up until it reached the necks of the\npeople.  And the people being in sore tribulation, and having given up all hopes of saving\ntheir lives, came to the holy apostles, and wept before them and confessed their sins.  And\nthe holy apostles said unto them, “Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and ye shall be saved”;\nand all the people believed.   And the apostles admonished them, and taught them the\nmystery of the knowledge of the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.   And the holy\napostles prayed to God, Who made the water to cease through their prayers, and then they\nbaptized them in the Name of the Holy Trinity.  And they entreated our Lord Jesus Christ\nto remove from them the disposition of wild beasts, and He did so, and they became mild\nand gentle folk and ate the food which men are wont to eat.  And the apostles appointed\nover them bishops and priests, and they tarried with them for a space of thirty days, during\nwhich they instructed them, and confirmed them in the Right Faith, and then they departed\nfrom them, and the people entreated the apostles to come back to them speedily.  Now\nSaint Matthias the Apostle went to the city of Damascus and preached therein in the Name\nof our Lord Jesus Christ.  And the men thereof took him, and laid him upon an iron bed,\nand they lighted a fire there under and kept it burning for seven days and seven nights. \nAnd when they came to him to look upon him, they found his face shining with a great\nlight, like the light of the sun; and the fire had not touched him at all, and his body and the\nhair of his head, and his apparel, had not in any way suffered.   Then they took deep\ncounsel together, and they lighted a fire and kept it burning under the iron bed whereon the\nholy man was lying until fourteen days had passed by.  After this [time] they brought him\nout from the fire, and they found him sound, and whole, and uninjured; and they marveled\nexceedingly, and they all believed on our Lord Jesus Christ through Matthias the Apostle,\nwho baptized them in the Name of the Holy Trinity.  And he appointed priests over them,\nand he tarried many days with them, confirming them in the Right Faith.  After this he\ndied a happy death in one of the cities of the Jews, the name of which was Pilawon, and\nthey laid his holy body therein; and very many signs and great wonders took place through\nit, and he healed those who were sick.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Julianus, Archbishop of the city of\nAlexandria; now he was the fourteenth of the number of the archbishops.  This holy man\nwas a priest in the city of Alexandria, and he was so learned and wise that during his days\nthere could not be found his like in the land of Egypt; and by the Will of God, he was\nappointed archbishop.  And during the days of his office he composed Homilies and many\nadmonitory Discourses, and he taught the people continually, and admonished them, and\nconfirmed them in the Right Faith.  And he dwelt in peace and safety during the days of\nhis office, and all the days of his occupation of the throne of Mark the Evangelist were\nfourteen years, and he died in peace.\nSalutation to the Seven Sleepers who, in order to escape from the service of dumb idols,\nbetook themselves to a cave, where sleep overtook them; they are commemorated on this\nday.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

His parents wished to make\nhim marry a wife, but he did not desire to do so.  And they settled him in a house and\nmarried him to a wife against his will, but he refused to consort with her, not because of\nthe law of righteousness, and not because of weakness of body, but because he hated the\nlust of the flesh; and he dwelt with his wife many days but preserved his virginity.  And he\nmultiplied his prayers, and he petitioned God therein, and made many supplications,\nsaying, “O God, have mercy upon me in Thy knowledge.”  And the angel of the Lord\nappeared unto him as he did unto Cornelius, and he taught him the Faith of our Lord Jesus\nChrist, and he commanded him to go to one of the apostles, and to be baptized by him. \nAnd he went and was baptized with Christian baptism, and he learned all the Law of the\nChristian Faith, and he received the Divine Mystery.  He heard continually the teaching of\nthe holy Apostle Paul, and he acquired from him purity, and the working of righteousness,\nand devotion to God’s service, and humility, and the habit of praying continually, and\nfasting, and prostration, and vigil; and God gave him the power to work signs and\nwonders, and he had dominion over Satans. And he persuaded his parents, and gave them\ninstruction, and brought them into the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, and also his wife,\nand her parents and kinsfolk.  When one of the unbelievers came into the house of idols to\noffer sacrifice to Satan, Kueten (Cythinus), the holy man, knew him, and he cried out\nagainst Satan, and he rebuked him, and commanded him to confess before the people, and\nto tell them who he was.  And  when the holy man forced him, that devil confessed before\nthe people that he was Satan, and was not a god.  And all the people who were there cried\nout, saying, “One is the God of Saint Kueten (Cythinus),” and they believed and were\nbaptized with Christian baptism.   And when the governor, who had been appointed by\nClaudius Caesar, heard the report of this holy man, he sent and had him brought before\nhim, and the holy man confessed our Lord Jesus Christ before him.  And the governor\ncommanded his soldiers to bind him, and to beat him very severely, and they did so. \nWhen the man of the city heard that the soldiers were torturing Saint Kueten (Cythinus),\nthey ran, and they all came to him, and wanted to kill the governor, because of their love\nfor Saint Kueten (Cythinus).  And the governor fled from them, and they released the holy\nman from his fetters, and they washed the blood off him, and carried him to his house. \nAnd he lived for many years, and pleased God Whom he loved exceedingly, and he died in\npeace.  After his death the believers dedicated a church to his name, and they carried his\nholy body into it, and God exhibited many signs and wonders through it.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

And he took the\nwood of the Honorable Cross, and he made captive very many of the men of the city of\nJerusalem, and he returned to his own country.  When the Emperor of Rome heard that\nPersians had raided the city of Jerusalem, and had carried away into captivity many men\nfrom it, and had taken away the wood of the Honorable Cross, he was exceedingly\nsorrowful because of these things.  And the King of Persia returned, and fought with him,\nand he slew very many of their men, and he went round about through all the city\nsearching for the wood of the Honorable Cross, and he found it not. Now the officer who\nhad taken it away had brought the two deacons to a certain place, which was nigh unto his\nhouse, and he gave them orders, and they dug a very deep hole in the ground, and buried\nthe wood of the Honorable Cross therein, and then he slew the two deacons.  And it came\nto pass that a certain maiden of the children of the priesthood whom that officer had\ncarried away captive, and who lived in his house, was looking out of the window of his\nhouse at the moment when he slew the two deacons, and buried the wood of the Honorable\nCross [in the hole].  And that maiden went and told Heraclius, the Emperor of Rome, what\nthe officer had done, and how he had slain the two deacons, and had buried the wood of\n\nthe Honorable Cross. When the emperor heard this he rejoiced exceedingly.   And that\nmaiden guided the emperor, with whom were some of his soldiers, and bishops, and\npriests, and they followed her until she brought them to the place.  And they dug there and\nfound the wood of the Honorable Cross, and they lifted it up out of the pit, and the\nemperor, in his imperial apparel, and all the people who were with him, bowed down\nbefore the wood of the Honorable Cross, and he rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.  And\nthe appearance of and the finding of the wood of the Honorable Cross a second time, took\nplace on the tenth day of the month of Magabit.  Then the emperor took the wood of the\nHonorable Cross with him to the city of Constantinople.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

but they rose up and cursed him and his idols.  And that night forty soldiers\nmade an agreement among themselves to go to that governor, and to receive the crown of\nmartyrdom at his hands.  When they were sleeping the angel of the Lord appeared unto\nthem in a vision and gave strength and fortitude to their souls.  In the morning they rose up\nand confessed their faith in our Lord Jesus Christ before their commander Agricolaus, and\nhe was wroth with them and threatened them, and they were afraid of him.   And he\ncommanded his men to stone them, but the stones came back upon those who stoned\nthem.  And there was near them a lake of water which was covered with ice, and near this\nwas a bath.  And the governor commanded his men to throw them into this lake of ice, and\nthey threw them in, and their limbs were split open by the excessive cold.  And one of\nthem was afraid of it, and he went forth from the lake and entered the bath house, but he\ndied quickly, and lost his reward, and did not find what he wished for.  And one of the\nwarders saw forty crowns descend from heaven and of them nine and thirty rested on the\nhead of the nine and thirty holy martyrs; and one crown remained suspended in the hand of\nthe angel.  Then straightway one of the soldiers who were stationed there rose up, and he\nstripped off his apparel, and went down into the lake with the holy men, and he died and\nreceived the crown which was suspended [in the hand of] the angel.  And the holy men\nremained in the lake, and some of them were young, and their handmaidens were\nencouraging them and urging them to suffer patiently.  And the holy men remained in the\nlake for a very long time, but they did not die; and they did not wish to break their legs in\norder that they might not die quickly.  And God received their souls, and the soldiers were\nnot able to break their legs.  After this the governor commanded his men to burn their\nbodies with fire, and to carry them away on wagons, and cast them into the sea.  As they\nwere carrying them away upon wagons, they found that one of them, a young man, was\nnot dead, and they did not put him on a wagon.  And his mother took him, and tried to\nthrow him on the wagon with the holy martyrs, but the warders stopped her, because he\nwas alive, and he died on her bosom, and she cast him on to the wagon, with the holy men,\nand they took him out to the city of Sebastia; and they cast them into the fire, and burnt\nthem, and then they threw them into the river.   On the third day those holy martyrs\nappeared unto the bishop of the city of Sebastia, and they said unto him, “Go to the river\nand there thou wilt find our bodies; carry them away.   Go there with the priests, and\ndeacons, and the people, and bring back our bodies, and bury them in a beautiful tomb.” \nAnd the bishop, and the priests who were with him, set out by night, and they went to the\nriver, and they found the bodies of the holy martyrs gathered together in one place like\nbright stars, and there was no portion of their bodies destroyed; and they took them and\nlaid them in a beautiful shrine.  And the history of these martyrs was heard in the ends of\nthe earth, and the people celebrated their commemoration, and built churches in their\nhonor in all the ends of the earth, and very many signs and wonders took place through\nthem.\nAnd on this day also Orthodox folk celebrated the festival of the commemoration of the\npersecution of Abba Macarius the Great, and of Macarius the Alexandrian.\nWhen Valentinus ruled over the Empire of Rom, after Valeno his brother, he afflicted and\npersecuted the orthodox believing people, because he believed in the abominable Faith of\n\nMani, and in the Faith of Arius, the evil one, and he appointed Lucius, the Arian,\nArchbishop of Alexandria, and drove the Apostolic Athanasius into exile.  This wicked\nman Lucius sought out Father Macarius the Great, and Father Macarius the Alexandrian,\nby the command of Waltes, the king, and had them brought from the desert.  When they\ncame into his presence he spoke unto them with seductive words and with blandishment\nand flattery and wished them to enter with him the Faith of Arius; but they would not turn\nfrom their Faith at his words, and they were not afraid of him.  And they rebuked him, and\nargued with him gently and patiently, and they made him to see from the Holy Scriptures\nthe rottenness of the Faith of Arius, and the wickedness of his words.  And straightway he\nbanished them to a remote island between Rome and Constantinople.   And they made\nready an Alexandrian ship and soldiers, and they set guards over them, who bound them\nwith fetters of iron, and treated them cruelly in every possible manner.  When they arrived\nat the island, the guards set them before the king of the island, who was an evil man, and a\nservant of Satan; moreover, he had corrupted the men of the island by his sorcery, until at\nlength they worshipped him, and made him a god; and they used to bow down and\nworship him.  When the king saw the fathers, he [tried to] compel them to worship him,\nbut they would not yield to his command.  Nay, they entreated him to turn from his error. \nBut he would not turn at their words, and he shut them up, and put them in prison, and\ninflicted many severe punishments and tortures upon them, and he afflicted them most\ngrievously.  And our Lord Jesus Christ appeared unto them, and encouraged them, and\ngave them strength to endure patiently.  And when God willed that their virtues should\nbecome manifest, Satan seized the daughter of the king, and tortured her with so many\ntortures that her father and her mother sorrowed greatly.  Now there were in the city many\nSatans, who manifested themselves boldly, and who cried out and said, “What have we to\ndo with thee, O Marcarius, and thy companion whom they have exiled from their\ncountry?”   And the Satan who had authority over the daughter of the king cried out,\nsaying, “If Macarius and his companion do not come hither, I will not go out of the king’s\ndaughter.”  When the king and those who were gathered together about him heard this,\nthey marveled; and they brought Macarius and his companion before the king.  And when\nthey had come to him [they manifested their power] over the unclean spirit which dwelt in\nthe king’s daughter.  And the king enquired of them concerning their business, and they\ntold him everything which had happened unto them, and he entreated them on behalf of his\ndaughter and asked them to heal her.  And they rebuked him and said unto him, “Seeing\nthat thou art but a man why dost thou make thyself a god?  If it be thou who hast created\nthe heavens and the earth, it is meet that thou shouldst thyself save thy daughter.”  And\nstraightway they prayed to our Lord Jesus Christ, and they cast out the devil from the\nking’s daughter, and as the devil was leaving her, he cried out and reviled the king, and the\npeople of that island, for their works of iniquity.  When the king and the multitudes saw\nthis, they cried out and said, “We believe in the God of these holy men, for we know that\nthere is no other god save theirs in heaven and earth”; and the holy fathers taught them the\nFaith of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And the people gathered together those who were sick and\nsuffering into one place, and the fathers prayed over them, and made over them the sign of\nthe Cross, and healed them; and they also gave relief to, and healed many men whom the\ndevils had seized, and they continued to do so for many days.  After this they pulled down\nthe temple in the city, and purified the site thereof, and they built there a church, for the\nsite was fair and spacious.   And the king commanded and the people brought there a\ncountless quantity of gold and silver, and silk vestments, and everything which was\nnecessary for the furnishing of the sanctuary of God.  And our holy fathers commanded\ncunning workers in metal and smelters to make twelve bowls, each of which weighed a\nletra, and to engrave on them a portrait of our Lord Jesus Christ, and a portrait of our holy\nLady Mary, the Virgin, and portraits of the two great angels Michael and Gabriel.  And\nthey ordered them to make twelve bases (or stands) for the twelve vessels, and twelve\nvessels, and twelve . . . , the twenty-one crosses, each one of which [weighed] three letra. \nAnd they ordered them to paint (or, engrave) three shrines (?), and everything which was\nordered for the ark of the testimony was complete, and all the vessels thereof; and the\nremainder of the money they distributed among the poor and needy.  And it came to pass\nthat on the eleventh day of the month of Ter, the day whereon our Lord Jesus Christ was\nbaptized, [the holy men] ordered the people of the city to go down to the sea-shore, and to\n\ngather themselves together there.   Now they had brought with them the holy oil, with\nwhich they had filled a vessel, when they were exiled form Alexandria.  This oil had been\npreserved from the days of the Apostolic Athanasius, for Lucius the Arian had not found\nit.  Thus God had preserved it all those days, and it had remained there, and nothing had\ninjured it; and this took place by the command of the Holy Ghost.  At the moment when\nMacarius made the sign of the Cross with the holy oil over the place of baptism, the water\nbubbled, and became like that which boiled by the heat of fire in a cooking pot.  And\nMacarius poured olive oil and Myron oil over the face of the water, and it became like\nshining stars, and there appeared from it light like unto the light of the sun.  When the king\nand the people assembled saw this they were afraid.  And our Lord Jesus Christ appeared\nfrom out of heaven, and John the Baptist, and the holy angels at the consecration of the\nwater, and the people were baptized in the Name of the Father and the Son and the Holy\nGhost.  And straightway there rose up a beautiful aroma which was sweeter than that of\nany perfume.  When the saints saw this they fell down upon their knees, and remained\nthere.  And Macarius made supplication to God as he knelt upon his knees, and said, “My\nLord, I beseech Thee to let Thy mercy find me, and to allow the consecration of this\ntabernacle, and the vessels thereof, to be performed by Thy Divine Hand.”  And the Lord\nsaid unto him, “I consent.”  And the Lord took the Myron oil from the holy father, and He\nlaid it in His right hand, and He consecrated the Tabernacle, and the vessels thereof.  And\nHe said unto Father Macarius, “I command thee to consecrate three ambulacra, and I am\nwith thee.  And thy companion Macarius shall serve with thee in this holy service; the first\nambulacrum, the middle one, shall bear the name of Mary, who gave Me birth, the Virgin;\nthat on the right shall bear the name of the Holy Cross; and that which is on the left shall\nbear thy name, for thou hast shed thy blood for My Name’s sake, through Lucius, the evil\none, in this island.”  And when the blessed men began to do as the Lord commanded them,\nDavid and the angels sang, and sanctified with their words the men of this island; and\nwhen the people heard the beautiful voices, they marveled and praised God.  And our Lord\nChrist also commanded Saint Macarius to carry the Offering upon the Tabernacle, and to\nconsecrate [it].  And Macarius said unto Him, “O my Lord, command Peter, the chief of\nthe Apostles, to consecrate this day, for on this day, for the first time, the Offering is\ncarried about, for Thy Name’s sake, in this island.”  And our Lord said unto him, “It is\nmeet for thee [to do this]. It is thou who hast sown in this island, and it is I Who give the\nincrease.  Hast thou not heard what I have said by the mouth of Paul my disciple, He who\nsoweth is he who shall eat his fruit early.”  and when Father Macarius began to consecrate\nthere stood with him the holy fathers Peter on his right hand, and Mark on his left, and all\nthe Apostles surrounded them to help him, and Macarius the Alexandrian was deacon. \nAnd Paul read the Book of Paul (i.e. the Epistle), and John read the Apostle (sic) (i.e. the\nGospel), and Luke read the Acts of the Apostles, and David read the Psalms, and our Lord\nand God read the Gospel, for His memorial, which is to be adored, and the Holy Spirit\ncame down in the form of a white dove upon the bread and wine; and they set forth the\nBody and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom be praise !  And when the holy man\nput his fingers round the cup, they became the color of blood.  And all the hosts of the\ncherubim spread out their wings over the Tabernacle, and Michael and Gabriel and all the\nApostles came to help them.  And Father Macarius and Macarius the Alexandrian became\nlike each other in form, and they gave the Holy Mysteries to the people.  And after the\nOffering was administered, our Lord Christ took the form of Father Macarius, and He sat\ndown above the throne from which the Gospel was read, and His face shone like the sun,\nand He gave the benediction to the people and returned into the Tabernacle, and His\ndisciples with Him.  And again after seven days our father Macarius prayed to the Lord\nand made mention concerning the establishing and the maintenance of the Church.  And\nour Lord appeared unto him and said unto him, “Thou art he who art worthy before Me of\nthis great glory.”  When the elder heard this he bowed low before the Lord, and he wept\nbitterly, and said, “Remember, O Lord, what Thou didst say unto me:  I will take thee back\nto thy sons the monks of Dabra Sihat, and thou shalt see them before thou goest forth from\nthis body.  And if I do not go back they will say, Macarius hath forsaken the monastic life\nand hath become  Patriarch.”  And the Lord said unto him, “O Macarius, I will fulfill for\nthee all the desire of thy heart; bring one of thy sons whom thou wouldst choose to be\nPatriarch.”  And the holy man said unto Him, “Thou, O Lord, knowest hearts, look then at\n\nthe aged metal-worker, for he is strong in the holy Faith, and he hath never known\nintercourse with women.”  And our Lord said unto him, “Let it be as thou sayest; in truth\nhe is a good man.”  Then the saint called this metal-worker, and made him a deacon; then\nhe appointed him a priest, and after that he raised him grade by grade until finally he\nattained the office of archbishop.  And he named him John.  And all the heavenly host\ncried out three times, saying, “Worthy, worthy, worthy is John, the Archbishop, the son of\nMacarius, the new sprout of Mark the evangelist”; and the king and all the people heard\nthese words.  And our Lord opened the eyes of the mind of John the Archbishop, and he\ngazed after our Lord Christ as long as he was able to see Him, and he uttered many words. \nAnd he saw the sanctuary filled with the spiritual hosts, and the prophets, and the holy\napostles.  And our Lord Christ called Abba Macarius the Great, and Abba Macarius the\nAlexandrian, and He said unto them, \"Blessed are ye, and blessed shall be the men who\nshall remember you upon earth, and they shall inherit life everlasting.  And I swear unto\nyou by Myself that whosoever shall suffer because of the toil which ye have endured for\nMy Name’s sake in this island, and shall see it and shall declare it in the church as he\npraiseth Me, he who hath heard from his (?) father all good things, such shall never lack\nanything.  And I will deliver them from all their tribulations, and I will forgive them their\nsins, and at the moment of their departure from this world I will send the angels of mercy\nto take their souls to everlasting pleasure, and to My kingdom, which ye have imagined. \nAnd in every religious house, or city, or church, or building of the Orthodox wherein this\nstory shall be proclaimed, I will dwell, and I will set My blessing, and My peace therein,\nuntil the end of the world.  Whosoever shall contradict this history it would be better for\nhim if he had never been born upon the earth.  If they repent truly I will forgive them. \nVerily I say unto you, as ye have confessed Me before men I will confess you before My\nFather Who is in heaven, and before the holy angels.”  And again He said unto them, “The\ntime hath come for you to return to your city”; and He gave them the benediction, and\nwent up into heaven.   Then straightway the blessed fathers gathered together all the\npeople, with the king, and told them that they were going to return to their own country,\nand they commanded them to keep all the Law of our Lord Christ, and to honor John the\nArchbishop.  And they committed to their charge many things, and exhorted them to turn\nneither to the right hand nor to the left from the True Faith.  When the people heard them\nthey were dismayed, and they wept bitterly, and the holy men wept together with them;\nand they dismissed them in peace, and blessed each of them.  And straightway an angel of\nthe cherubim came, and lifted them up, and carried them on his wings, and in a single\nnight brought them to Alexandria and let them descend into the city before the gates of the\nmonastery of Abba Timothy the Archbishop at dawn on the First Day of the week.  When\nAbba Timothy heard of this, he rejoiced with an exceedingly great joy, and when he saw\nthem again he wept with many tears, and bowed down to the fathers.  And they also bowed\ndown before him, and they embraced each other, and they conversed about what had\nhappened to them, and they told him of the conversion of those foreign peoples to the\nLord, and of the wonders which had taken place.   And the archbishop marveled, and all\nthe people who heard marveled, and they praised God; and Macarius the Egyptian, and\nMacarius the Alexandrian, remained there eight days.   And the angel of the cherubim\nappeared again, and he carried them on his wings and brought them to Dabra Sihat, and a\ncherub cried out in the air, saying, “O sons of Abba Macarius, behold your father hath\ncome back from exile, bearing the fruits of the Holy Ghost”; when the monks heard this,\nthey all went forth from their cells; now the monks were in number fifty thousand.  Among\nthem was Abba John the “Short,” and Abba Besoy, and they embraced his hands and his\nfeet, and they wept bitterly when he told them all that had happened unto him.  Then they\nrejoiced because they saw his face again, and he rejoiced with them, and blessed them in\nthe Name of our Lord Christ.  Therefore it is meet for us who are of the Faith of our Lord\nChrist, and all the men of Rome, and of every city and country, to rejoice on this day.  And\nwe command you to make it a festival each year, as a memorial of those fathers who\nfought strenuously, like Peter and Paul, and those who shed their blood for the Name of\nour Lord Christ our God, that is to say Abba Macarius the Great and his spiritual brother\nMacarius the Alexandrian.  It was the thirteenth day of the month of Magabit on which\nLucius exiled them from the city of Alexandria to the island which we have already\n\nmentioned, and it was on the same day of Magabit on which they returned, and arrived in\nthe city of Alexandria.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Dionysius, the fourteenth Archbishop of\nAlexandria.  This holy father had parents who were pagans and unbelievers, and he studied\nmany kinds of learning, for his father belonged to an honorable family.  Now this father\ntook great care of him from his youth up, and he taught him every kind of learning and\nwisdom, and at length he became a teacher of the pagan sages.  As he was sitting down\none day, behold a certain old woman, who was a Christian, passed by, and she had with her\na quire of a book containing an Epistle of Saint Paul the Apostle; and she said unto him,\n“Take this quire, and buy it from me.”  And when he had read it he found in it strange\nspeech, and he found that it was admirable.  And he said unto her, “For how much wilt\nthou sell it?”  And she said, “For one dirham of gold”; and he gave her three dirham of\ngold, and said unto her, “Go, seek and find the rest of this book and bring it unto me.” \nAnd she went and brought him three more quires, and he gave her nine dirham of gold. \nAnd having read them through he found the book to be [still] incomplete, and he said unto\nher,  “Go, and search for the rest of this book.”  And she said unto him, “I found these\nquires among my father’s books.  If thou dost want a complete Book of Paul the Apostle\nenquire among the men of this church.”  And he said unto her, “If I were to enquire of\nthem would they give it to me?”  And she said, “Yea.”  And he went and enquired for the\nBook of Paul the Apostle of one of the priests, and he gave it to him, and he read it, and he\nlearned it by heart, and he used to recite it openly without the book, saying, “Believe on\nour Lord Jesus Christ.”  Then he went to Saint Abba Demetrius the Archbishop, and he\nasked him to baptize him with Christian baptism, and Demetrius taught him everything he\nwanted, and baptized him, and Dionysius became perfect in the doctrine of the Church;\nand Abba Demetrius made him a teacher of the children of the Church.  When Yarokla was\nappointed archbishop, he made this man his deputy in the city of Alexandria, and he\ndispensed judgment among the believers; and he gave him authority to administer the\nwork of the archiepiscopate.  When Saint Abba Yarokla died, all the people agreed and\nthey appointed this father, Saint Dionysius, Archbishop of the city of Alexandria, and he\nprotected his flock well and carefully.  And great tribulation and much sorrow came upon\nhim during the days of his office, for he was appointed during the days of the reign of\nPhilip, who was a lover of the Christians.  And when Decius rose up against Philip, and\nmade war on him, he conquered him and slew him, and reigned in his stead.   And he\nafflicted the believers with a very great affliction, and slew many martyrs among the\narchbishops and bishops, and others.  And very many men fled in fear and terror, and came\ninto the desert, where some of them died.  And the soldiers of this emperor seized this\nfather, and they treated him with very great indignity.   Then Gerlawos destroyed that\ninfidel, and reigned in his stead; and in the days of this emperor the affliction of the sons\nof baptism diminished and died down.  When he died and Valerius reigned in his stead, the\npersecution of the Church broke out again.  And his governors seized this holy father, and\nshut him up in prison, and tortured him with manifold cruel and severe tortures.  Then they\nrequired of him to worship idols, and he answered and said unto them, “We will not\nworship idols, and we will only worship God the Father, and His Son Jesus Christ, and the\nHoly Spirit.” And the emperor was exceedingly wroth with him, and he killed many men\nin front of him, in order to terrify him; but the holy man was not afraid of him; and the\nemperor banished him and he remained in exile for many days.  After this the emperor\nbrought him back from exile, and he said unto him, “I hear that thou dost consecrate the\nOffering secretly by thyself.”  And the holy man answered and said unto him, “We will not\ngive up our prayers, and our consecration of the Offering neither by night, nor by day.” \nThen the holy man returned to the people who were with him, and he said unto them, “Go\nye and consecrate the Offering, and even if I am remote form you in the body, I shall be\nthinking of you in the spirit”; and the governor was wroth and sent him back into exile. \nAnd God raised up against this infidel a host of barbarians, and he was afraid of them; and\nthey slew him and gave the empire to his son.  And his son was an exceedingly wise and\nan understanding man, and he released all the believers whom his father had shut up in\nprison, and he brought back those who were in exile.   And he wrote a letter to the\narchbishops, and to all the bishops, and he said unto them, “Fear ye not, neither be afraid.\n\nOpen your churches and light your lamps, for no evil whatsoever shall befall you.”  And\nthis holy father lived the days which remained to him in peace and quietness.  In the days\nof this father there arose many disputes because of the Faith.   Certain men of error\nappeared in the country of Arabia, and they said with the wickedness of their deeds, “The\nsoul dieth with the body, and then riseth up with it on the day of the Resurrection.”  And a\nCouncil assembled to deal with them, and the members thereof anathematized them, and\ncut them off.  And again others were [in favor of ] Sabellius.  When this Father Dionysius\nhad grown old, there appeared Paul of Samosata, Archbishop of the city of Antioch, who\ndenied the Son.  And a Council against him assembled in the city of Antioch, but Father\nDionysius did not come with them because of his old age, he sent an epistle full of all\nkinds of learning, and grace (or, courtesy), and he revealed therein the True Faith, and\ncounsel and goodness.  When he had arrived at a good old age he departed to God, having\nsat upon the throne of Mark the evangelist twelve years.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

How long art thou going to continue in this wicked\nwork?”  And one day a certain man came into the house of this elder, and he found him\nlying down as it were asleep, but he had delivered up his soul to God.  And on the floor of\n\nhis house were written some words wherein he said, “O men of Alexandria, condemn no\none before his time; his opportunity [for explanation] will be when God cometh.”\nAnd on this day also died Abba Sinoda the martyr.  This holy man was a native of the\ncountry of Behnesa, in the land of Egypt.  And certain men laid information against this\nholy man before Maximianus, a governor appointed by Diocletian, and they said unto him,\n“Sinoda is a Christian, and he doth not worship idols.”  And the governor had him brought\nbefore him, and he questioned him concerning his Faith, and the holy man confessed\nbefore him our Lord Jesus Christ, and declared that he was the True God.   Then the\ngovernor commanded his soldiers to lay him out upon the ground, and to beat him with the\nrods, which they carried in their hands; and they did so until, is flesh was cut into strips,\nand his blood ran over the ground like water.  Then they dragged him along the ground by\nhis feet, and cast him into the prison house, which was dark and stank vilely.   And\nMichael, the angel of the Lord, appeared unto him, and strengthened him, and made him\nwhole, and healed his wounds, and he said unto him, “Be strong, fear not, for crowns of\nglory have been prepared for thee because of thy toil.  Thou wilt be condemned to suffer\ngreat tortures, but I will be with thee according to God’s command unto me”; then he\ndisappeared from him.   When the morning had come, the governor commanded his\nsoldiers, saying, “Go and look at that wicked man who transgressed the imperial\ncommands, and if he is dead cast him out to the dogs.”  When the soldiers came to him\nthey found him standing up praying, and they told the governor about him, how he was\nwhole, and unharmed, and how there was no trace of any pain in his body, and how he was\npraying with great fervor, like a man who was full of joy and health, and had never\nsubmitted to torture at any time.   Then the governor had him brought to him and he\nmarveled at his life (vitality?).  Then he had his clothes stripped off him, and he saw that\nhis body was whole and uninjured; and he was amazed and said, “This is the great\nmagician whose like I have never seen before.”  And he ordered his soldiers to crucify\nSinoda, head downwards, and to light a fire under him; and beat him with large whips,\nwhich caused him much pain.   When the governor was tired to torturing him he\ncommanded his soldiers to hack him in pieces with swords; and they hacked him in pieces\nwith swords, and cast him to the dogs, but the dogs would not come near him.  When it\nwas night the believers carried him off in secret, and they wrapped him up in new cloths,\nand in many tomb wrappings, and they laid him in a coffin and buried him; and many\nsigns and healings of the sick took place through his body.  And he received his crown of\nmartyrdom in the kingdom of heaven.\nAnd on this day also Eugenius, and Eugandarus, and Alibidius (Abiladyos) became\nmartyrs.  These holy men were Christians, through their fathers and mothers.  And they\nwalked in the path of God, being learned in all Divine learning, and Saint ‘Armos,\nArchbishop of the city of Jerusalem, chose them, and made them bishops, not of any\nknown sees, but he sent them to preach the Gospel in all the cities.  And they preached in\nmany cities, and the unbelievers in one of the countries seized them, and beat them very\nseverely, and mercilessly, and they stoned them, and then they tied ropes to their\nshoulders, and dragged them along the ground.  And as they were being dragged along\nthey were beaten until they died.\nAnd on this day also Thomas the Apostle worked a miracle upon a woman with whom a\ndevil had had intercourse for a period of seven years, for she cried out to him, saying, “O\napostle of our Lord Christ, deliver me from the enemy who afflicteth me sorely.”  And he\nsaid unto her, “By what means hath he found thee?”  And she said unto him, “As I was\ngoing forth from the beth he met in the form of a man who was hurried and excited, but his\nwords were clear and distinct, and he said unto me, ‘Come, let us have intercourse\ntogether, and do for me all that a woman can do.’  And I said unto him, ‘I do not want to\nhave intercourse with thee; leave me.’   When I fell asleep at night he came and had\nintercourse with me, and when I try to flee he afflicteth me.  I know that devils and Satans\ntremble at thy prayers, therefore pray for me and deliver me from my tribulation.” When\nthe apostle heard this he prayed for her and he anathematized the Satan, and he went forth\nfrom her.  Then Thomas made the sign of the Cross over her, and he administered to her\nthe Holy Mysteries, and he sent her away to her kinsfolk.\n\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and very many of\nthe believers fled from the land of Egypt.  And the number of men who denied Christ was\ntwenty-four thousand.  And because of these things this father archbishop sorrowed with\nvery great sorrow, until at length God did away the causes of this thing, which were due to\nHim.   In the days of this father, an archbishop was appointed over the Malakawiyan\n(Malachite), whose name was Cosmas, and this father debated with him concerning the\nunity of the Nature of our Lord Christ.   And Cosmas believed that it was even as this\nfather said, and he wrote with his own hand, saying, “Our Lord Christ hath His Unity, one\nNature in His Incarnation, even as Cyril the archbishop saith.”  And his bishops wrote the\nsame thing with their own hands, saying, “It is not right to say concerning our Lord Christ\nand to assign to Him after His Unity two distinct Natures and two distinct Persons, like\ntwo men.”  And they agreed about this Faith, and they assigned to him one holy, general\nand Apostolic Church.  And Cosmas, the Archbishop of the Malakawiyan (Malachite), was\npleased to be Archbishop of the city of Mesr (Cairo), and they all agreed about this\ncounsel.  But among them was one corrupt person, a certain man who was a Malachite,\nand whose name was Anastasius, who objected to this; he was an Alexandrine, and he\nwished them to make him archbishop, and they appointed him.  And when they would not\nagree, Constantinus, Bishop of Mesr (Cairo), was pleased; now he was under the authority\nof Abba Michael.  On this man there fell great tribulation from the rule of the oppressors,\nand they punished him most severely.  They beat him with many strips, and they bound\nhim with fetters of iron, and they shut him up in prison for many days; and they brought\nhim before the judges of the government so that they might cut off his head.  And God\nsaved him in order to protect the flock of the people.  And there was great torturing (or,\npersecution) in the days of the reign of Marwan (Marwan II, A.D. 744), [and] in the days\nof the governorship of Gabra Iyasus, the son of Muse (Moses), the son of Nasir, who\nwithdrew from Judaism to Islam.  And he shut up the archbishop in prison, and demanded\nmoney from him; then he showed him kindness and brought him out, and then he banished\nhim.   And he departed into Upper Egypt to beg for alms, and he brought back to the\ngovernor much money.  And this holy man went into Upper Egypt, where he worked very\nmany miracles, and he turned many of those who had denied our Lord Christ and brought\nthem back into the Right Faith.  When the King of Ethiopia heard the history of this father,\nand how the Muslim governor had punished him, and how they had shut him up in prison,\n\nhe was filled with holy indignation, and he went down into Egypt, and he came to Upper\nEgypt, and laid waste many cities and spoiled them.  When he went down to the land of\nEgypt there were with him ten thousand horses, and one hundred thousand mules, and one\nhundred thousand camels.  When the King of Egypt knew that all this [invasion] had taken\nplace for the sake of the archbishop, he released him from prison, and heaped great honors\nupon him; and in like manner he heaped exceedingly great honors upon the Christian\npeople.   Then the King of Egypt entreated this father to write a letter to the King of\nEthiopia, and order him to return to his own country.  And this father sent a letter to the\nKing of Ethiopia wherein he invoked blessings upon him, and upon his governors and\ngenerals, and all his army, and he said unto him, “Behold God hath delivered us from the\nbonds of captivity through thee.  And now return to thy country in safety and peace, and\nGod shall reward thee in the kingdom of heaven for the toil which thou hast undertaken for\nme.”  When the King of Ethiopia had read the letter sent to him by this father Archbishop\nAbba Michael, he rose up quickly and returned to his country in peace.  When the holy\nfather had finished his good strife he departed to the God Whom he loved.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and then He raised him up, and thus a great\nmiracle took place.  And during these four days Lazarus saw the abodes of the righteous,\nand of sinners.   And our Lord Who raised him up came to him, even as John the\nEvangelist, the proclaimer of the Godhead, who was a witness of this, saith, “Our Lord\ncalled him after he had been in the grave four days, and He said unto him, Lazarus,\nLazarus, come forth”; and Lazarus went forth, his hands, and his feet, and his face being\nswathed in funerary bandages, after the manner in which men swathe the dead; a miracle! \nAnd the going forth of his hands and his feet and his face, which were swathed, was as\nmuch a miracle as the resurrection of his body.  Now the reason of his going forth from the\ngrave with his hands and feet and face swathed in funerary bandages, which had not been\nunloosed in the tomb, was that all men might know that he had been dead, and that some\nmight not think that his resurrection had been agreed upon among themselves.  And our\nLord commanded that he should go forth swathed, just as he had been prepared for burial;\nfor this reason it was a great miracle.  And if some infidels thought that he was alive in the\ntomb, how could he go forth there from with his hands, and his feet, and his face,\nswathed?  But we Christians believe and confess that it was our Lord Jesus Christ Who\nraised up Lazarus out of the tomb, after he had been dead for four days, for He is able to\ndo everything, He is our Lord, and God, and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, Who is to be adored,\nwith His Good Father, and the Holy and Life-giving Spirit for ever and ever.  Amen.\nAnd on this day also Theocritus, the reader, became a martyr.  This holy man was a native\nof the city of Rome.  And when [the soldiers] seized all the Christians, and compelled\nthem to offer up sacrifice to idols, they seized this Theocritus with them, and they brought\nhim to the emperor who said unto him, “Wilt thou offer up sacrifice, or wilt thou put my\ntortures to the test?”  Now Theocritus was a youth fifteen years old, and he said unto the\nemperor, “I bring offerings unto my Lord Jesus Christ.”  And the emperor said unto him,\n“Sacrifice, O Theocritus, so that thou mayest not die a cruel death.”  And Theocritus said\nunto the emperor, “Come, O Emperor, thou and thy wisdom, and look upon my\nofferings.”  And the emperor commanded the soldiers to take him into the house of his\ngod, so that he might sacrifice there; and the emperor stood at the door, and when Saint\nTheocritus had prayed there was an earthquake in that place, and their god Aesculapius fell\ndown.  And the emperor, seeing Theocritus smile, commanded the soldiers to cut off his\nnose, and to bind him in fetters in the prison house.  On the following day they brought\nhim out, and put him into bonds, and they also dug a deep pit, and spread logs of [burning]\nwood over it, and they cast him into it until the flesh of his limbs was torn into strips, and\nthe marrow of his bones dripped out from them.  And the emperor and his soldiers were\nnot able to kill him in this way.  And they brought him again into the house of their idols,\nand locked him up therein, and they thought that their gods would take vengeance upon\nhim, but he broke them, and spat upon the idols.  And the angel of the Lord opened the\ndoors for him, and he took the gold of the idols, and distributed it among the poor and the\nneedy.  And having returned, the doors were locked again, and were even as they had been\n\nbefore.  And when, after eight days, the emperor opened the doors, they found their idols\nthrown down and smashed; and the holy man mocked and laughed at them.   And the\nemperor commanded them to hide the righteous man until he could make to appear the\ngods who had been destroyed.   And again he commanded them to take him into the\ntheatre, and they brought him there, and the emperor sent lions against him, but the lions\nonly licked his wounds.  And again the emperor commanded them to put him on a rack,\nuntil all his limbs were torn out of their sockets, and his body was distorted in a terrible\nmanner; but even then Theocritus conquered mightily, and the emperor was afraid.  When\nthe emperor saw his boldness, he commanded them to cut off his head with the sword. \nAnd Saint Emerianus, the Bishop, and all the congregation, and crowds of people followed\nSaint Theocritus, who was helping them with [his] prayers, and they embraced and kissed\nthe holy man.  And the executioner took up his sword, and cut off his head and Theocritus\nfinished his martyrdom.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated the saints Gregory, the fighter, and Talasius, the\nmartyr, and Joseph, the Bishop, and the translation of the body of Nikor, the high priest.\nSalutation to Gregory, Talasius, and the bishop.\nSalutation to Abba Garima who appeared to Melimo in Dabra Dekhukhan [and] Dabra\nKananmo.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

And having finished his\ncourse nobly and faithfully he died in peace; and behold Paul, the Apostle, mentioneth him\nin his Epistle to the Romans (chapter xvi, verse 10).\nAnd on this day also are commemorated the following martyrs:  Alexander the Egyptian,\nand Alexander and Agabius from the city of Gaza, and ‘Amilas from the city of Bunitos,\nand Dionysius from the city of Tripolis, and Ramelos and Thalasius from the vineyards of\nEgypt.  These seven men made a pact together in Messianic love, and they came to the\ngovernor of the country of Caesarea of the Philistines, and they confessed our Lord Jesus\nChrist before him, in the days of the infidel Diocletian, and he tortured them with severe\ntortures, and they received crowns of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.\nAnd on this day also died Saint ‘Askenafer, and his wife Martha, and his sons Arcadius\nand John.  This ‘Askenafer had many possessions, and much riches, and he was a keeper\nof the Law of God, and he brought up his sons with spiritual admonitions.  When they\nwere grown up he sent them to the city, which is called Tayrut in order to learn wisdom\nand discipline.  When they had finished their education he sent a message ordering them to\nbe brought to him, so that he might rejoice in their progress.  And as they were sailing on\nthe river, their ship was wrecked, and God having saved them from drowning, a wave cast\nup John at a certain spot, and Arcadius at another.  Having lost all hope, John went to a\nmonastery, and became a monk, and he wasted his body by fasting and prayer for the sake\nof his brother Arcadius, whom he believed to be dead; and Arcadius also wept because he\nthought that his brother John was dead.  And John appeared unto him in a dream, and told\nhim that he was alive.  And Arcadius went to the holy places, and he journeyed to the\ndesert where John was, and became a monk under a holy elder, and he remained striving in\nthe ascetic life for three years.  When “Askenafer heard of the death of his sons, he and his\nwife put on sackcloth, and strewed ashes over themselves.  One night ‘Askenafer had a\nvision in which he saw John, and he had a crown of jewels on his head, and a cross in his\nhand; and he saw Arcadius also who had upon his head a crown in the form of a star.  And\nhaving risen up, he told the visions to his wife, and he said unto her, “Come, let us go into\nthe sanctuary, so that we may enquire for news of our sons”; and when they had gone into\nthe sanctuary they prayed.  And they went to the Jordan, in the monastery of John the\nBaptist, and they found the elder who had received Arcadius their son as a monk, and they\nfell down at his feet and told him their trouble.  And he said unto them, “Sorrow not, O ye\nbeloved of our Lord Christ, when ye return to the sanctuary ye will find your sons”; and\nthey turned away rejoicing.  And John came to worship at the feast of the Cross, and the\nelder called John, and made him to meet Arcadius his brother; and then they embraced\neach other and wept.  And again the elder called ‘Askenafer, and made him to meet his\nsons, and ‘Askenafer and his wife wept over Arcadius and John, and kissed them.  And\n\n‘Askenafer assumed the monastic garb with that elder, and he made his wife to enter a\nhouse of women, and he set free his slaves, and distributed his possessions among the\npoor.  Then he put on sackcloth made of hair, and he went out into the desert and [lived\nthere] in fasting and prayer.  And he, and his blessed sons, and his wife Martha died in\npeace.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

And having\nurged this father, the archbishop with difficulty rose up--he the father of them all and\nhaving authority over them, and he began the consecration.   When the wicked bishop\nheard of this, Satan entered his heart, and he rose up, and came to the church, full of wrath,\nand he went into the sanctuary, and snatching the Offering from the plate he broke it and\ndashed it to the ground; and he went out being full of wrath.   And the archbishop\ncommanded and they brought another Offering, and he consecrated it and gave to the\npeople the Holy Mysteries.   And on the following day this honorable father gathered\ntogether the people, and the bishops who were with him, and the priests and the teachers,\nand he cut off that wicked bishop from his see, and appointed another bishop in his stead. \nAnd Satan entered into the heart of that wicked bishop, and he went to the Governor of\nEgypt, Ahmad Ibn Tawlun (born A.D. 835, died 884), and laid information against this\nfather, the archbishop.  And he said unto him, “Know thou that this archbishop possesseth\nmuch riches, gold and silver, and also many churches which are filled with sacred vessels,\nin gold and silver.”   And the governor had this father brought before him, and he\ndemanded from him the sacred vessels, which were in the churches.  And the archbishop\nrefused to give them up, and he said unto the governor, “Behold, my body is before thee,\ndo what thou wishest with me; and my soul is in the hand of God.”  And the governor\ncommanded his soldiers to bind him hand and foot, and they bound him, and shut him up\nin prison; and he remained in prison for a year and more.  And this father began to fast\ncontinually, and he ate nothing but bread, and salt, and boiled beans.  After this a certain\nscribe, a Christian and a believer, whose name was John, came to the governor, and\nbecame surety for the archbishop, and he undertook to give the governor two thousand\ndinars in gold.  And the father, the archbishop, came forth from prison, and he departed to\nhis house and remained there for a few days.  Then the believing elders and the monks of\nthe desert of Scete collected ten thousand dinars of gold, and the men of Alexandria, who\nhad sold a portion of their estates, [also] collected as much as a thousand dinars, and the\narchbishop gave them to the governor.  And this [father] himself signed a document for the\nmen of Alexandria [promising] to give them each year ten hundred dinars, and the other\nsum of ten thousand dinars he wished to regard as a loan from the believers; and he came\nfrom his house, so that he might visit [various] cities.   And he came to a certain city\n[called] Balbayus (Beles) and rested therein for one day.   And there came unto him a\ncertain poor and needy monk, who was dressed in rags, and he received a blessing from\nthe father, the archbishop, and he lodged by the gate with his disciple.  And he said unto\n\nhis disciple, “Say to the father, the archbishop; Be not anxious in thy mind, for within forty\ndays from this day thou shalt be relieved, and thou shalt receive the bond of redemption\nunder which thou art liable; and thou shalt give nothing to the governor.”  And the disciple\nspoke to the father, the archbishop, and informed him according to the orders of the monk;\nand the father sought for the monk but could not find him.  And before forty days were\nended the governor died an evil death.  And his son was appointed governor in his stead. \nAnd he returned to the father, the archbishop, the bond of redemption, and he was freed\nfrom his obligation even as the monk had prophesied.  And this father after living in great\ntribulation and sorrows [all] the days wherein he held his office, that is to say, twenty-nine\nyears, died in peace.\nAnd on this day also our Lord raised the righteous man Lazarus from the dead, he having\nbeen dead for four days; and very many people believed because of this great miracle.\nSalutation to our Lord’s journey from Jerusalem to Bethany when He raised up Lazarus.\n[On this day is commemorated Tsege-Selassie, the ascetic.]\nAnd on this day also Stratonice became a martyr, and glory attacheth to this holy woman. \nHer father was a worshipper of idols, but she was a believer on our Lord Jesus Christ, and\nshe fasted and prayed in secret, until her body became emaciated, and her appearance was\nchanged.  When she was fourteen years of age her father and her mother said unto her,\n“What is it that maketh thee so emaciated?”  And she said, “I pray to our Lord Jesus Christ\nto forgive my sins.”   When her father heard this he went to Tiberius and told him the\nmatter concerning his daughter, and he brought her to the tribunal and the governor, and\nthe governor tried to persuade her to worship idols; when she refused he cast her into the\nprison house.  And her mother, who was a Christian, came to her, and strengthened her in\nthe Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ.  Then the king ordered his men to make an iron ball\nred-hot, and they made her to hold it in her arms and to clasp it to her breast, and she took\nit in her hands and broke it; and when the people saw this they believed on our Lord\nChrist, and as many as seven hundred and thirty men became martyrs.  And they brought\nher again into the prison house.  Then they made an iron animal with claws (or, hooks) in\nit, and they brought her to it to cast her into its belly, and to hang her upon the claws (?),\nbut when they did this the animal, by the power of God, became split asunder on this side\nand on that.  When the people saw this they believed on our Lord Christ, and about four\nthousand and eighty-one became martyrs.  Then they cast her into a pit, which was full of\nvenemous serpents, and when she prayed they became like dust.  And they also brought a\nhuge stone, which was as much as four men could carry, and they suspended it from her\nneck; and when she prayed the stone split into four pieces.   And those who saw this\nbelieved in our Lord Christ; now they were pagans, fourteen in number, and they became\nmartyrs.  And they prepared an iron pot full of boiling lead to pour upon her,  and when\nthey grasped the pot, it broke, and the lead ran over them, and killed those who prepared\nit.  And the king was wroth, and he commanded his soldiers to cut off her head with a\nsword, and when she had come to the place of martyrdom she prayed to God, and a voice\ncame from heaven, saying, “O blessed art thou Stratonice, for thy name is written in the\nBook of Life”; and then she was crowned by the sword.\nSalutation to Stratonice.\nSalutation to the six thousand one hundred and eighty-five men who were martyred with\nStratonice.\nAnd on this day also was consecrated the church of Saint Abba ‘Askaran.  Salutation to\nAbba ‘Askaran.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

he cometh riding upon the foal of an ass.”  And Abraham\nhimself called this festival the “festival of the God [of] joy” when he went round the altar\nbearing young branches of the palm.  And David said, “Out of the mouths of babes and\nsucklings Thou hast prepared praise” (Psalm viii, 2).  And Solomon saith, “The tongues of\nchildren (or babes) ordain righteousness.”  And he also saith, “And old men and children\nshall play in the streets of Jerusalem, and they all shall have their staves in their hands.” \nAnd one shall say, (Zechariah viii, 4, 5) “Make broad thy nails and drape thy tabernacles.” \nNow as to the conclusion of the matter; our Lord Jesus came to Jerusalem riding upon an\nass, even as it is written in the Gospel.   And He drew nigh to Jerusalem, opposite to\nBethpage and Bethany, by the mountain which is called ‘Elyon.  And He sent two of His\ndisciples and said unto them, “Go ye into the city in front of you, and when ye come in ye\nshall find an ass tied whereon never man hath ridden; loose him and bring him hither.  And\nif any shall say unto you, ‘Why are ye loosing him?’ say ye, ‘His Lord hath need of him.’” \nWhen those who were sent had gone there they found it [to be] even as He said unto them;\nand they loosed the ass.  And whilst they were loosing the ass the owner thereof said unto\nthem, “Why are ye loosing him?”  And they said unto him, “His Lord hath need of him”\n(Matthew xxi, II, III).  And they took the ass, and brought him to our Lord Jesus, and they\nspread their garments upon him, and they mounted our Lord upon him.  And there were\nmany who strewed branches of trees which they had cut off the trees, and many who\nstrewed their apparel on the road on which He went, and those who followed Him cried\nout, saying, “Hosanna in the heights!  Blessed is He Who cometh in the Name of the Lord,\nand blessed is the kingdom which cometh in the Name of the Lord which our father David\n[prophesied].  Hosanna in the highest.”  And our Lord Jesus went into the sanctuary, and\neveryone saw Him.   And when the evening was come He went into Bethany with His\ntwelve disciples.   On the following day He went forth from Bethany, and He was a\nhungered.  And he saw a fig tree afar off and there were leaves upon it, and He went to see\nif He could find any fruit on it.  And having come to the tree He found on it nothing but\nleaves, for it was not the time of the year for figs, and He answered and said unto the fig\ntree, “Never shall any man eat fruit from thee”; and His disciples heard Him.  And He\ncame to Jerusalem and went into the sanctuary, and He began to drive out those who\nbought and those who sold in the temple, and He overthrew the tables of the money-\nchangers, and the seats (or, stands) of those who sold doves, and He stopped everyone\nfrom taking out goods connected with the temple.   And He taught them and said unto\nthem, “Is it not written that He said, ‘My house shall be a house of prayer for all nations,\nand ye have made it a den of thieves’?”  (Matthew xxi, 13).  And John saith, “After He\nraised up Lazarus, on the following day, when the many people who had come to the feast,\nheard that our Lord Jesus Christ had come to Jerusalem, they took branches of trees and\npalm branches from Jerusalem and welcomed Him.  And having gone forth they cried out\nand said, ‘Hosanna in the heights!  Blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord, the\nKing of Israel.’  And our Lord Jesus found the ass, and He mounted him, even as it is\nwritten, ‘Fear not, O daughter of Zion, behold thy King cometh riding upon the foal of an\nass.’  And His disciples did not know when our Lord Jesus Christ was praised that all this\nhad been [ordained] of old, but they remembered [afterwards] that these words were\nwritten thus concerning Him, and that because of this the people had done as they did.\n\nAnd those people who were there with Him were witnesses that He had summoned\nLazarus form the grave, and had raised him up from the dead.  Therefore those people\nhaving heard that He had worked miracles, and especially the miracle of the raising of\nLazarus, welcomed Him.  And the Pharisees said among themselves, ‘Do ye now see that\nnothing whatsoever will avail?   Behold, all the world followeth Him.’”   Matthew and\nMark do not (sic) mention the matter of the palm branches, but they say, “And others cut\ndown branches from the trees and strewed them in the way.”  And Luke mentioneth neither\nthe branches of trees nor the palm branches, but he saith, “And as they went along they\nstrewed their garments on the road.”  It is John only who saith, “They took branches of\npalms from Jerusalem”; now there were no palm trees in Jerusalem.  When our Lord was a\nchild He went down into the land of Egypt with His mother, our Lady Saint Mary; and\nthey found there palms.   And our Lord commanded that some of their roots should be\npulled up and planted on the Mount of Olives, and forthwith the roots of the palms flew\nthrough the air, and planted themselves there.  From these palms the people took branches\nand welcomed our Lord Jesus Christ amid Hosannas, and thereupon envy seized the\nJewish people and because of it they sought to kill our Lord Jesus Christ.\nSalutation to the going up of Christ to Jerusalem, and to His entry therein.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father and spiritual man Abba Cyril, Bishop of the city\nof Jerusalem.  This holy father grew up under the teaching of the Church, and he was an\nexceedingly learned teacher.  When Maximus, Bishop of Jerusalem, died, the people chose\nthis father and appointed him to be his successor, and he shepherded his people well and\ncarefully, and he protected them from the abominable and heretical wolves.  And when the\nbishops were assembled in Council in Sedreke, this father came and disputed with the\nfollowers of Arius, and he defeated them.  And he scattered them and drove them away,\nand he chased Acacius from his throne of the city of Caesarea.   And Acacius went to\nConstantine the emperor, the son of Constantine the Great, and he complained to him\nabout what had come upon him through the Council, and especially about what he had\nsuffered from Cyril.   And the emperor sent and exiled this Cyril from the city of\nJerusalem, and he drove many bishops from their thrones.  And this holy man went to the\ncity of Tarsis, and he visited Sylvanus, bishop of that city, who helped him and made him\nstay a few days with him.  And when the Council assembled in Lukaya, this father was one\nof those who were present thereat, and he cursed Akayyos (Achaeus).   And Akayyos\n(Achaeus) also went to the emperor, and told him what had befallen him, and he made\naccusations against this holy father Abba Cyril to the emperor, who sent and again exiled\nhim.  When Constantine died, and his son Constantine reigned, he sent and brought back\nthis father from exile to his throne, and he also brought back all those bishops whom his\nfather had exiled.   And this father lived for the remainder of his days in peace and\nquietness.  When Theodosius the Great reigned, and a Council of One Hundred and Fifty\nBishops were assembled in Constantinople, on account of Macedonius, and Sabellius, and\nApollinarius, this father came and cursed all those who followed them.  And he added to\nthe prayer of the Faith which the Three Hundred and Eighteen Orthodox Fathers had\ndrawn up from the place where it saith, “And we believe in the Holy Spirit” to the end\nthereof.  And this father composed many Homilies and Exhortations, and he composed\nalso a second book which contained eighteen Homilies on the translation of the prayer of\nthe Faith (i.e. Creed), and this book is exceedingly profitable, and is full of all kinds of\nwisdom.  And he sat on the Episcopal throne three and thirty years, and died in peace.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

Then Nebuchadnezzar saw another dream, and Daniel\ninterpreted it also to him, and he made him know the meaning thereof, saying, “Because of\nthine arrogance, God will make thee to go forth from among the race of men, and He will\nmake thee to dwell with the beasts in the desert for seven years, and thou shalt eat grass\nlike the beasts.  After this He will restore thee to thy kingdom”; and all his prophecy was\nfulfilled even as he spoke.   And after Nebuchadnezzar died, Daniel interpreted to\nBelshazzar, his son, that which the angel wrote for him on the wall, when he was drinking\nout of the holy vessels of the house of God.  And he made known unto him that his number\nwas written, and that he was measured, and weighed, and that the interpretation thereof\nwas, “God hath prepared thy throne and thy kingdom for another, for He hath weighed\nthee in a balance, and found thee wanting, and He hath made thy kingdom to pass to the\nkingdom of Mani, and to the kingdom of Persia”; and his prophecy was fulfilled.  And\nGod showed him in visions all the kings who were to reign after him until the end of the\nworld, and the appearance of the False Christ; and he also saw the glory (or, praise) of\nGod, and His greatness, and he saw the glory of our Lord Christ, and His Godhead.  And\nhe prophesied concerning His coming, and he assigned to it a known period of years. \nWhen these years were ended, our Lord Christ came, even as Daniel had prophesied, and\nhe said, “Our Lord Christ shall come, and they will kill Him.  And after Him there shall\nnever be another savior of Jerusalem, for Jerusalem, and the sanctuary, after the\nCrucifixion of our Lord Christ, shall be laid waste, and the offerings and the altars shall be\nabolished”; and all these things were fulfilled even as he prophesied.  And there was in the\ncity of Babylon a certain idol the name of which was Bel, and they used to give him each\nday twelve measures of the finest wheaten flour, and forty rams, and seven skins of wine.\n\nAnd Koros (Cyrus), the King of Persia, used to worship him every day, and he thought that\nthat idol ate and drank that which they used to give him from the king’s house.   And\nDaniel rebuked the king because of this, and he said unto him.  “This idol neither eateth\nnor drinketh”; and the king was wroth, and he asked the priests of the idol about the idol\nBel.  And he said unto them, “Is it true the Bel neither eateth nor drinketh?”  And the\npriests said unto him, “Verily Bel the Idol eateth and drinketh what is given unto him\nevery day.”  Then they laid before the idol all the food and drink, and the king was to\nwatch for the meal-time [of the idol]; and the priests went out.  After they had gone out\nDaniel commanded [the servants] to bring some ashes, and they brought them to him, and\nhe scattered them about the house of the idol whilst the king was looking on with his eyes;\nthen the king and Daniel sealed the temple with the king’s seal, and they departed to their\nabodes.  Now the priests of the idol had a passage into the temple under the earth, and they\ncame into the temple thereby, and took the food and the drink which were before the idols,\nand departed.  And on the following day the king opened the house of idols, and did not\nfind the meat and drink where the priests had laid them, and the king cried out, saying,\n“Great art thou, O Bel, who hast put Daniel to shame.”  And Daniel laughed at him, and he\nshowed the king the marks of the feet of men in the ashes.  Now before this the king said\nunto Daniel, “Why dost thou not worship Bel, my god?”  And Daniel said unto him, “As\nfor me, I do not worship idols, but I worship the Living God Who created the heavens and\nthe earth.”  It was because of this Daniel revealed unto the king that the idol Bel neither\nate nor drank.  And he showed the king the marks of the feet of the priests in the ashes, and\nDaniel said unto the king, “See, O king, on the ground the [marks of] the feet of men, and\nwoman, and children.”  And straightway the king was wroth, and he slew the priests of the\ngods, and their women and their children; and he gave the idol Bel to Daniel, and Daniel\nbroke him in pieces and destroyed the temple.  And there was also a great serpent which\nthe men of Babylon used to worship.  And the king said unto Daniel, “Now, thou canst not\nsay that this serpent is not a god; do thou then worship him, for he is the Living God.” \nAnd Daniel said unto the king, “I worship only the Living God, but give me authority to\nslay this serpent without sword or staff”; and the king said unto him, “I have given him to\nthee.”  And Daniel took bitumen, and hair, and fat, and boiled them together, and he made\n[the mixture] into small cakes, like bread, and he cast these into the mouth of the serpent,\nand it swallowed them and died.  And Daniel said unto the people, “Behold the gods of the\nmen of Babylon!”  When they heard this they gathered together to the king, and they cried\nout, saying, “Hath the Jew Daniel become king?  Behold he hath broken Bel in pieces, and\nhath slain the priests and the serpent.”  And they said unto the king, “If thou dost not give\nunto us this Daniel that we may kill him, we will kill thee and the men of thy house”; and\nthe king was exceedingly sorry for Daniel.  And the people seized Daniel and cast him into\na den of lions, that the lions might rend him in pieces.  Now there were seven lions in the\nden, and they used to give them each day the bodies of two men and two goats; but in\nthese days they gave them nothing to eat, so that they might become famished and devour\nDaniel.   And God sent an angel and he carried Habakkuk from Jerusalem, as he was\ncarrying food for the reapers, and he laid it down in the den, in Babylon, before Daniel;\nand Daniel ate and was comforted by the words of Habakkuk.  And at that moment the\nangel of God took Habakkuk back to Jerusalem.  And on the seventh day the king came to\nthe den to weep over Daniel--now he thought that Daniel was dead--and to look into the\nden.  And the king saw Daniel sitting down, and the lions were licking his feet like cats. \nAnd the king cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Great is the God of Daniel, Who hath\nmade the lions to be submissive to him, and so like unto cats that they lick his feet.”  And\nstraightway the king commanded his servants to take Daniel up out of the den, and to seize\nhis enemies, who had made accusations against him, and cast them into the den.  And at\nthat moment the lions devoured them before the king and before Daniel.   And Daniel\ndwelt in the city of Babylon until the children of Israel returned to Jerusalem, that is to say,\nseventy years, and he died in peace.  Salutation to Daniel.\nAnd on this day also the Council of the Jews assembled in the house of Caiaphas, that they\nmight take counsel together against our Lord.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

Say thou unto him, It is the\npriest, the anchorite, who hath defiled my virginity.”  When the father of the maiden knew\nthat she was with child, he asked her, saying, “Who hath committed this deed of shame on\nthee?”  And she answered and said unto him, “One day I went to that anchorite priest,\nwhose name is Macarius, and he seized me by force and lay with me, and I am with child\nby him.”  When her parents heard this thing they were exceedingly wroth, and they went\nto Saint Macarius, and there were many people with them, and made him to come forth\nfrom his cell.  Now he knew not what had happened.  And they beat him very severely,\nand inflicted such pain upon him that he was well nigh dead.  And the holy man asked\nthem, saying, “What is my sin that ye beat me thus unmercifully?”  Then they tied a rope\naround his neck, and suspended from it pots which they had blackened with charcoal, and\nthey dragged him about to this side and to that, like a madman, and they cried out, saying,\n“This is the man who hath defiled the virginity of our daughter.”  At that moment there\nappeared angels in the forms of men, and they said unto these wicked men, “What hath\nthis fighter done?”  And they told them what he had done to the maiden.  And those angels\nsaid unto them, “This is a lie, for we have known this man from his childhood to the\npresent day, and he is a good and righteous man.”  And the angels drew nigh to Macarius,\nand they released him from his bonds, and they cast the pots from him.  And those wicked\n\nmen said unto the angels, “We will not let this man go until he giveth us what he is bound\nto give.”  And a certain man who used to buy the work of the hands of Macarius undertook\non his behalf to give to the girl food until she brought forth the child; and he took\nMacarius and departed to his cell.   And Macarius reproached himself, saying, “O\nMacarius, behold thou hast now a wife and a child, and it is meet for thee to work night\nand day for thine own food, and for that of thy child and thy wife.”   And he worked\ncontinually at weaving mats and baskets, and he gave them to that man, the kind brother,\nwho ministered unto him; and he sold them and gave the money to the woman [to buy]\nfood.  And he continued to work in this wise until the time drew nigh when the woman\nwould bring forth her child.   When the day for her delivery drew nigh her labor was\nexceedingly difficult, and she continued to suffer very greatly for four days and four\nnights, and she was nigh unto death, and did not bring forth.  And her mother said unto\nher, “What hath happened to thee, for behold thou wilt die?”   And she said unto her\nmother, “Yea, death is fitting for me, because I played the harlot with such and such a\nyoung man, and I spoke words of falsehood against the man of God, the priest, Saint Abba\nMacarius, the anchorite.”  When her parents heard this they were exceedingly sorry and\nthey and all the people of the city gathered together, and they took counsel concerning the\nholy man, how they should ask him to forgive them the wrong, which they had done him. \nWhen Saint Abba Macarius heard that the men of the city wished to come to him to ask\npardon from him, he remembered the vision, which he had seen in the desert, and he\nconsecrated the Offering and he partook of the Holy Mysteries.   And that six-winged\ncherub appeared unto him, and took him by his hands, and led him, and brought him to the\ndesert of Scete, the interpretation of which [name] is “Balance of hearts.”  And Saint Abba\nMacarius said unto the cherub, “O my lord, [this] place is too strait for me to live in.”  And\nthe cherub answered and said unto him, “I have not marked out a place for thee, so that\nthou might not quarrel with the place which I might mark out for thee, and transgress the\ncommandment of God.  Behold, all this desert is thine, go wherever thou wishest and live\nthere.”  So Saint Abba Macarius dwelt in the Inner Desert, in the place of the monastery of\nthe Roman (Greek) Saints Maximus and Dymateus; and when they came to him they dwelt\nnear him.  After their death the angel of the Lord commanded him to go and dwell in that\nplace where his monastery is at this day.   And the angel said unto him, “This place is\ncalled after the names of thy sons Maximus and Dymateus,” and it is that which is called\nthis day “Dabra Barmos (Baramus),” which is interpreted “Dabra Rom.”  And Saint Abba\nMacarius made a cave therein, and dwelt there, and he fought a strenuous fight there with\nfasting, and prayer, and bowings to the earth, and incessant vigils; and Satans used to\nappear before him, boldly, and in visible forms, and Satans used to wage war against him,\nby night and by day.  And after passing three years in strife and labor, and Satans afflicting\nhim, and finding no rest, he thought and said within himself, “When I was in the world I\nused to hear the report of Saint Abba Anthony, I will rise now and go to him, so that he\nmay guide me on the path of the ascetic life, and may give me knowledge and\nunderstanding, so that I may know the counsels of the foul Satans.”  And he rose up and\nprayed and went into the desert towards the east, until he came to the place where the holy\nelder Anthony was.  And when he saw him afar off he said, “This is an Israelite in whom\nthere is no guile,” and he received him, and embraced him with great joy; and Macarius\nrevealed to him his mind, even as doth a son to his father.   And the holy elder Abba\nAnthony embraced the head of Saint Abba Macarius, and he said unto him, “O my son\nMacarius, who art called ‘Blessed,’ according to the interpretation of thy [name] in the\nlanguage of the Greeks, the Lord my God hath revealed unto me thy work and thy coming\nto me, and for this reason I have been expecting thee.”  And the holy elder Abba Anthony\ntaught Saint Abba Macarius all the path of the holy ascetic life, and he strengthened him,\nand spoke many things concerning the working of righteousness.  And he revealed unto\nhim the method of warfare of the Satans, and he said unto him also, “They will fight\nagainst thee in thy mind secretly in vain, and they will work against thee openly to the\ndeath in order that thou mayest be perfect; when they fight against thee endure patiently to\nthe death.”  And Saint Abba Macarius asked Abba Anthony, saying, “Let me dwell with\nthee.”   And Saint Abba Anthony said unto him, “Go unto the place which God hath\nmarked out for thee, and abide there in patience.”  After he had dwelt with the elder Abba\nAnthony for a few days, learning the ways of the monastic life and the ordinances of\n\nrighteousness, he rose up and returned to his place, rejoicing and full of gladness in the\nordinances and life-giving doctrine which he had learned from Saint Abba Anthony.  And\nthe blessed Abba Macarius visited Saint Abba Serapion, the bishop, and he said unto him,\n“During all the days which I dwelt with my father Abba Anthony I never saw him sleep at\nall.”  And Saint Macarius dwelt in his cell many days, fighting strenuously in the path of\nmonkhood, and the Cherubim used to visit him openly.  One day he heard a voice from\nheaven, saying, “O Macarius, because thou hast hearkened to My voice and to My\ncommand, and hast come to Me and dwelt in this place, behold, I will gather together in\n[this] place innumerable people, of every race, and from every country, and of every\ntongue, and they shall serve Me, and they shall bless My Name by their fair works; receive\nthou them, and guide thou them in the path of righteousness.”  When Saint Abba Macarius\nheard this he became strong, and his heart became bold.  And he stood up praying in the\nnight, and God revealed the matter to him, and he heard the Satans taking counsel among\nthemselves, and they said, “If we let this man live in this desert he will guide many people\nhere, and they will settle in this desert, and they will inherit heavenly cities, for they put\ntheir hope in everlasting life, and they will drive us out of this desert, and they will inherit\nheavenly cities, for they put their hope in everlasting life, and they will drive us out of this\ndesert, by the pain of the torture of their prayers.  Come, let us gather together against him\nnow, and peradventure we may be able to drive him out of this place.”  When Saint Abba\nMacarius heard this, he strengthened his heart, and he waxed strong against the Satans,\nand he blessed God Who had opened his ears so that he could hear the counsel of the\nSatans, and he knew their feebleness.  After this the Satans gathered together against him,\nand they waged a great war against him, and they lighted a fire by the door of his cell, and\nthey took pieces of fire and cast them into it, and the fire was extinguished by the prayer of\nSaint Abba Macarius.  When they were vanquished in this matter, they cast into his mind\nthe thoughts of fornication, and anxiety, and pain, and arrogance, and the love of the glory\nof this world, and fear, and self-laudation, and restlessness, and blasphemy, and lack of\nfaith, and despair of God, and very many other [temptation] of the same kind; with these\nthey waged war against him, even as Saint Abba Anthony had said.  And having remained\nthere for many days with the Satans waging war against him by means of these\nabominable things, he rose up again and went to Saint Abba Anthony.  And when Saint\nAbba Anthony saw him afar off, he spoke unto his disciples and said, “This indeed is an\nIsraelite in whose heart there is no guile.   O my sons, do ye see this man?   He shall\nbecome a staff of righteousness, straight and long for many peoples.  And he shall [bear]\nsound fruits from the mouth of the God of Hosts.”  When he had come to Saint Abba\nAnthony, he bowed down before him even to the ground.  And Anthony raised him up\nquickly, and embraced him, and kissed him, because he saw that his face was changed, and\nthat it had become as the face of a sick man by reasons of the wars, which the Satans had\nwaged against him; and after they had prayed they sat down together.  And Saint Anthony\nanswered and said unto him with joy, “Art thou well, O my son Macarius?”  And Saint\nMacarius answered and said unto him, “Behold, God hath already told thee and shown\nthee what hath happened to me.”   And when Abba Anthony had instructed him and\nstrengthened him, he said unto him, “Be strong and fear not.  It is desirable that it should\nbe thus with us, so that we may endure patiently all those temptation which our enemies\ncan bring against us.  And for this reason it is meet for us to become teachers of the many\npeoples who love spiritual wisdom, that is to say monasticism.”  And he said unto him, “O\nmy son Macarius, remember that word which God spoke unto thee when thou wast going\nto draw water.”  When Saint Abba Macarius heard this he marveled exceedingly, and he\nknew that his affairs and his secret matters were manifest to Saint Abba Anthony through\nthe Holy Spirit.   And Macarius dwelt with the elder Abba Anthony many days, being\nblessed by him, and learning his commandments; and he asked him to endue him with the\nholy garb.  And Anthony prayed over him and arrayed him in the garb [of the monk], and\nfor this reason Macarius is called the disciple of Saint Abba Anthony, Then the elder Abba\nAnthony said unto him, “Trouble not thyself to come hither to me, for I am earth of a very\nfew days, and I am going to God.”  When Abba Macarius heard these words he rose up\nand bowed low before him, and entreated him that he might dwell with him, and make\nhimself fit to receive his spiritual blessing; and Abba Anthony said unto him, “Remain\nwith me,” and Macarius remained with him.  And after a few days Abba Anthony said unto\n\nhim, “God will give thee rest from the superabundance of these evil thoughts. \nHenceforward the Satans will wage war on thee openly, even as they have done to me.  Be\nstrong, and take good heed that thou dost not grieve that cherub whom God hath appointed\nto help thee, and to be with thee, until the end of thy days, and [then] he will protect thee,\neven as the Lord thy God hath commanded him.”  And Abba Anthony gave him his staff,\nand embraced him with a holy embrace, and he died, and Macarius buried him in a hidden\nplace, the site whereof no man knoweth.  And Saint Abba Macarius returned to the desert\nof Scete, and he dwelt in his cell, and the report of him was heard in all the ends of the\nearth.  And God wrought great miracles through him, and among them was that concerning\nthe daughter of the King of Antioch.  She was possessed of an unclean spirit and her father\nsent her to Abba Macarius.  She came to him disguised in the apparel of a young man, but\nMacarius knew that she was a maiden, and he healed her, and sent her away to her father\nand mother; and although they gave him much gold, he would not accept any part of it\nwhatsoever.  And there was a certain erring monk in the city of Wesim, and he said, “There\nis no resurrection of the dead,” and he led many men into error, and because of their trust\nin him they accepted his words.   And the bishop of the city of Wesim went to Abba\nMacarius, and told him that that monk was leading his people into error, and he entreated\nhim with many entreaties to help him.  And Abba Macarius rose up and went to the bishop\nof the city of Wesim, and he saw that anchorite in whom was the unclean spirit.  And\nhaving talked with him about the resurrection of the dead, that anchorite answered and\nsaid unto him, “I will not believe that the dead will rise unless thou wilt raise up a man\nfrom the grave before me.”  And Saint Abba Macarius prayed and made supplication to\nGod, and straightway a man rose from the dead; now the man who was raised up was in\nformer times one of those who denied Christ.  And that anchorite believed and turned from\nhis error, and all those men whom he had led astray turned with him.  And that man who\nhad been raised up from the dead entreated Saint Abba Macarius to baptize him with\nChristian baptism, and he baptized him, and he arrayed him in the garb of the monk, and\nhe dwelt with Macarius seven years, and died.  After this Saint Abba Macarius rose up and\ncame into the Inner Desert, in order that he might learn if there had ever been monks\nbefore him in the desert.  And he saw two naked men, and he was afraid of them, for he\nimagined them to be Satans.  And he prayed before them, ‘Elbat ‘Aribon, that is to say,\n“Our father which art in heaven.”  And one called out to him by his name, and said unto\nhim, “Fear not, O Macarius”; and Macarius knew that they were desert saints.  And they\nquestioned Macarius about men in the world, and their doings, and he answered and said\nunto them, “God in His mercy thinketh for them all.”  Then Macarius asked them if the\ncold during the winter froze them, and if the heat of the sun scorched them in the season of\nsummer.  And they answered and said unto him, “God hath cared for us during the period\nof forty years which we have lived in this desert, and He hath never frozen us in the winter\nor scorched us in the summer.”  And Saint Abba Macarius said unto them, “How can I\nbecome like unto you?”  And they said unto him, “Stay in thy cell, and weep for thy sins,\nand thou wilt become like unto us”; and he was blessed by them and returned to his place. \nAnd when monks multiplied round about him, they dug wells for themselves, and built\n[cells] for themselves.  When the saint went down to the wells to wash, the Satans leaped\nupon him to kill him, and the monks came and took him away from them.  And when God\nwished him to have rest, He sent to him the cherub who was wont to visit him, and he said\nunto him, “It is meet that we should come and take thee.”  And he saw Abba Anthony, and\nAbba Pachomius, and the Company of the Saints, and all the powers of heaven, and he\ndelivered up his soul.  And all the days of his life were ninety-seven years.  And of the\nfollowing Abba Babnuda his disciple was witness.  He himself saw the soul of Saint Abba\nMacarius ascending to heaven, and he heard the Satans crying out and calling after him,\n“Thou hast conquered us, thou hast conquered us, O Macarius, thou hast conquered us.” \nAnd the saint said unto them, . . ..   And when the holy man entered the Garden (i.e.\nParadise), they cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Thou hast conquered us, O\nMacarius.”  And Saint Abba Macarius said unto them, “Blessed be my Lord Jesus Christ,\nand blessed by the holy Name of Him Who hath delivered me from your hands.”  Now\nwhen the holy man was alive he commanded his sons to hide his body [after his death]. \nAnd certain men came from the city of Susawir, and gave money to his disciple John,\nwhom the holy man was always rebuking, and they said unto him, “Keep this money [as a\n\nmark of] affection.”  And that disciple guided them, and showed them the body of Saint\nAbba Macarius, and they took it and carried it to their city, and it remained there for one\nhundred and sixty years, until the Kingdom of the Arabs.  And his disciple John became a\nleper, through his love of money.  After the death of Saint Abba Macarius his sons, the\nmonks, went to his city Susawir, and wished to take away the body of the saint; but the\nmen of the city and the governor rose up against them, and prevented them.  That night\nSaint Abba Macarius appeared unto the governor, and said unto him, “Let me depart with\nmy sons.”  In the morning the governor summoned the monks, and commanded them to\ncarry away the body of their father, and they carried it away forthwith, and they took it and\nlaid it in the church; and they sang many hymns as they did so, on the nineteenth day of\nthe month of Nahase.   And a great many miracles and wonders took place through it. \nSalutation to Macarius.\nTwo-fold salutation to the holy martyrs of the holy house of Yasla, monks and widows;\nsome were burnt and some were slain by sharp knives.\nSalutation to the twin images of the blessed ‘Ammat Hanna, and ‘Ammat Wahed, her\ndaughter, who died by fire.\nSalutation to Stephen, whose mouth was bridled, and also to Agathon, who shed their\nblood for Jesus Christ.\nAnd on this day also was crucified our Lord and God and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, to\nWhom praise in the body is due because of the salvation of the world.  The sun became\ndark when it saw its Creator crucified by His own will, and that which should have been\nvisible covered itself over.  And the period of darkness lasted from the sixth to the ninth\nhour, and in that time our Lord bowed His head by His own free will, and delivered up His\nunderstanding and rational soul which He had received from our Lady, the Virgin Mary,\nand that soul was separated from its body.  And it went into Sheol without separation from\nthe Godhead, even as Saint Peter the apostle saith, “He was dead in the body and alive in\nthe spirit.”  And at that same time His body was hung upon the wood of the Cross, without\nseparation from the Godhead.  Similarly His soul descended into Sheol, like a released\nprisoner, and it had one nature and was without separation from the Godhead.  And He\nwas exalted high above the heavens, sitting with the Father and the Holy Spirit.\nSalutation to Thy Passion, O God the King.\nSalutation to Thy Crucifixion on the Cross.\nSalutation to the going forth of Thy Soul from Thy Body.\nAnd on this day also died the strenuous ascetic and fighter Abba Hezekiah, the father of\nthe monks of Dabra Libanos.  He was the fourth abbot from our father Takla Haymanot. \n[Omitted in the Bodleian MS.]\nAnd on this day also the God-loving Claudius finished [his] crowning with martyrdom. \nHe was brought up piously by the Orthodox King Lebna Dengel (i.e. David II, Wanag\nSagad I, who died 2nd September, 1540) and when his father died God made him king. \nThere was a certain Muslim, whose name was Grann (i.e. the “left-handed”), who called\nhimself a king, though it was not right [to do so], and all the men of Ethiopia believed in\nhis might, and associated themselves with him in his belief.  The remaining people in the\ncountry who clung to Christianity, he made to slave for him.   He pulled down the\nchurches, and carried off the greater number of the people captive into Ethiopia, and he\nsold them to whom he pleased.  And he said, “Henceforward no man can resist me; I have\ncaptured all the cities.”  Then God raised up King Claudius, and he began to make war\nagainst the nobles of the kingdom of that iniquitous man, and he conquered them.  When\nGrann heard [this] he was furious, and he marched against Claudius with tens of thousands\nof men, and horses, and Turks, and they joined battle, and God killed him, and destroyed\nhim by the hand of Claudius.  And the captives returned [from Ethiopia], and the churches\n\nwhich had been laid waste were rebuilt, and the Orthodox Faith of Christ [was restored]. \nAfter this one of the Muslims came with many men of war, and he came upon King\nClaudius when he had [only] a few men with him.  And the Muslim said unto him, “Let us\nremain quiet and not fight each other until the officers of our armies arrive.”  And Claudius\nsaid, “I will not remain quiet, and see Christians carried off into captivity, and the churches\ndestroyed.”  Whilst he was saying this the soldiers arrived, and the fighting between them\nwaxed fierce and strong.  And all the Muslims closed up behind him, and they all stabbed\nhim with their swords, and they pierced him with many spears, and they dragged him\ndown off his horse, and he died, and they cut off his glorious head with the sword, and\nthey carried it off.  Salutation to the mention of the name of Claudius.\nA prayer to Christ to bring Sharad Dengel into the kingdom of heaven, and to preserve the\nkingdom of his son Fasiladas (i.e. Sultan Sagad II, ‘Alam Sagad, who died in October,\n1667).\nAnd on this day also died the God-loving King Claudius, and the glorious father, Abba\nJohn, Abbot of Dabra Libanos, and a very large number of believing monks, who became\nmartyrs through the soldiers of the Muslims.\n \nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

now she was a\nChristian, and she conceived this King Constantine.  Then his father Kuensta left ‘Eleni\n(Helena) in the city of Roha (Edessa) and returned to the city of Byzantium, and she\nbrought forth this Saint Constantine.  And she brought him up very piously, and she taught\nhim every kind of learning, and she sowed in his heart mercy and compassion for the\nChristians, but she did not dare to have him baptized with Christian baptism; now she was\na Christian, and she told him that she was a Christian.  And he grew up, and he was a bold\nand skilful horseman.  And he rose up from his city, and went to Byzantium, and his father\nrejoiced in him when he saw that he was full of wisdom and learning, and that he was a\nbold and skilful horseman, and he made him king, and crowned him with the royal crown. \nAfter two years his father died, and he received all the kingdom.  And he reigned with\njudgment and integrity, and he removed from the people the services, which those who had\nbeen emperors before him had made them, render.  And all the peoples were subject unto\nhim, and they loved him, and obeyed him, and the report of the righteous judgments,\nwhich he used to pass, was heard throughout all countries.  And the elders of the city of\nRome sent to him, and asked him to come to them, and to release them from the service of\nMaximianus.  When he had read the letter, which they had sent him, he was sorry because\nof the tribulation, which had come upon them, and he meditated anxiously about what he\ncould do to relieve them of their tribulation.  And whilst he was sitting in the judgment\nhall, in the middle of the day, there appeared to him a cross by his side in the form of stars,\nand on it was written in the Greek language Nikos Aton, which being interpreted is, “With\nthis thou shalt conquer thine enemy.”   And he marveled when he saw the light of that\ncross, for it was quenching the light of the sun.  And he meditated about what was written\non it, and he showed it to the chief officers of his army, and the chief officials of his\nkingdom; and they marveled, and they did not know for what reason that cross had\nappeared.  That night the angel of the Lord appeared unto Constantine in a vision, and said\nunto him, “Make a sign for thyself like that sign which thou didst see at mid-day, and with\nit thou shalt conquer thine enemy.”  When he awoke from his sleep, he strengthened his\nheart, and he made a cross of gold, and set it above the royal crown, and he ordered all his\nofficers and his soldiers to make a cross upon their weapons, and they did so.  Now this\ntook place in the seventh year of his kingdom in the city of Byzantium.   Then he\nassembled all his armies, and went out to deliver the men of the city of Rome.  And the\nreport of him was heard by Maximianus, and he made a bridge over the sea, and he and his\nsoldiers crossed over to Constantine to do battle with him; and then they met together and\njoined battle and fought.  And it came to pass that wherever the cross was in front the\nsoldiers of Maximianus melted away, and Constantine killed countless men of the army of\nMaximianus, who took to flight with the remainder of his troops.  And Maximianus and\nhis men rushed on the bridge in order to enter the city of Rome, and the bridge broke and\nhe and all his men were drowned in the sea, even as were Pharaoh and his hosts.  And\nConstantine entered the city of Rome, and the people thereof welcomed him with lamps,\nand instruments of music, and garlands, and plays, and laughter, and decorations with\npearl-stones, and the wise and learned men praised the Honorable Cross, and called it the\nSavior of their city.   And they made a great festival in honor of the Honorable Cross,\nwhich lasted for seven days.  And when Constantine reigned in the city of Rome, he and\nall his soldiers were baptized with Christ baptism by Saint Sol, Archbishop of the city of\n\nRome, in the eleventh year of his reign, which is the fourth year after the Honorable Cross\nappeared to him; and he reigned over a Christian and Messianic kingdom.  And he sent\nthroughout his kingdom, and commanded [his governors] to set free all who were\nprisoners for the sake of the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And he also commanded them\nto pay honor to all Christians, and not to abase them, and he commanded them to give to\nthe priests the property and lands of the heathen temples.  And he commanded them to\ngive authority to Christians as governors, and to set them over the pagan peoples, and he\ncommanded that they should do no business during the octave of the Passion, and what\nfolloweth it, even as the Apostles commanded.  Then he sent his mother ‘Eleni (Helena) to\nJerusalem, to search for the wood of the Life-giving Cross, wherein lay his help and his\nconquest.   In the seventeenth year of his reign the General Council of the Saints\nassembled, Three Hundred and Eighteen Bishops, and good regulations for all Christian\nfolk were drawn up.  Then he decided to build in the city of Byzantium, and he built in the\ncity of Byzantium; and he built a great city, which was [called after] his name\n“Constantine,” and he built in it a large church in the name of our holy Lady, the Virgin\nMary, the God-bearer, and he called it, “Hagia Sophia.”  And he decorated it with all kinds\nof decorations, both material and spiritual, because there were gathered together inside it\nthe bodies of many of the apostles and holy martyrs.  And having fought his noble fight, he\nbecame a little sick in the city of Nicomedia, and he died therein, and they made him ready\nfor burial and laid him in a gold sarcophagus; and they carried him and brought him to the\ncity of Constantine.  And the archbishops, and the priests, and all the people went out to\nmeet him, and they followed him to the tomb with prayers, and psalms, and spiritual\nhymns; and they laid him in the sanctuary of the holy apostles.  And all the days of his life\nwere five and sixty years.  He lived three and thirty years before he became king, and he\nsat on his royal throne two and thirty years, according to the years of the world.  Salutation\nto Constantine, the builder of churches.  Salutation to ‘Eleni (Helena), who showed the\nmemorial of the Resurrection to the people of Constantine.\nSalutation to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

When all the men of Gaza had gathered\ntogether in the house of idols to worship their idols.  And Samson stood up in the house of\nidols, and he laid hold of the two pillars, one with his right hand, and one with his left, and\nhe lifted up both of them, and the two pillars fell down, and that house of idols fell down. \nAnd those who died in that house of idols at that slaughter were far more in number than\nthose he had slain in all the days of his life; and he himself died with them, for he\ndetermined that all the enemies of God, who were very many, should die with him.  And\nall the days which Samson judged Israel were twenty years, and he died in peace. \nSalutation to Samson who was called the Nazarite.\nAnd on this day also was translated the body of James the “chopped.”  Now behold, we\nhave written the history of his strife on the twenty-seventh day of the month of Hedar. \nSalutation to James, the “chopped,” whose body was translated from Persia.\nSalutation to John who afflicted his body with toil, and who ate only as much bread as the\nhand would hold.\nHere endeth what is read in the month of Magabit in the peace of God.\n[Here follows a long section on Gabra Manfas Kedus, which is wanting in the Bodleian\nMS.]\nAnd on this day took place the strife of Abba Gabra Manfas Kedus, the star of the desert,\nof glorious renown, and fine old age, the blessed and excellent man Abba Gabra Manfas\nKedus, the desert man, who sprang from the city of Nehisa, in the north of Egypt.  And he\ndwelt in the desert three hundred years.  When he went forth from that place, he wandered\nabout in the deserts of Ethiopia, and he dwelt in Gekala, and then departed to the land of\nKabd, and he lived [there] naked, drinking no water and eating no food, unlike a man upon\nearth and unlike an angel.  And he finished his strife on the fifth day of Magabit, on the\nFirst Day of the week, on the festival of Peter and Paul.  This holy man had a father and\nmother who were pious people, and they were believers, and they were of noble race.  His\nfather’s name was Simeon, and his mother’s name was ‘Aklesya, and they were righteous\nbefore God.  And they remained childless for a period of thirty years, and ‘Aklesya wept\nbecause she had not got a son, and her husband also wept.  One day the Holy Spirit came\nto the place where she was, by the door of the courtyard, and she imagined that he was a\npriest who lived in the palace.  And he said unto her, “Peace be unto thee!  What maketh\nthee weep and to groan before God?”  And ‘Aklesya said unto him, “I rejoice in every\nwork of the Lord my God, but I groan because [I have not] a son.”  And at that moment\n‘Aklesys conceived, on the 29th day of Tahsas.  And the angel whose name is Gabriel\ncame in the form of a man, and said unto her, “The name of this child shall be Gabra\nManfas Kedus”; and then that angel disappeared.  And on the third day the child rose up,\nand came down from his mother’s breast, and he stood up and bowed three times to the\nFather, and three times to the Son, and three times to the Holy Ghost, and he also said,\n“Glory be to the Father, Glory be to the Son, Glory be to the Holy Ghost, Who hast\nbrought me out of the darkness into the light.”  And those who were there and heard him\nmarveled, and his mother marveled, and she remained stricken with surprise until the third\nhour.  And God commanded the angel Gabriel and said unto him, “Go to the house of\nSimeon, and take the child from the breast of his mother, and bring him into the desert\nwhere there are many monks, and lay him down in their courtyard.   And say to the abbot,\nTake the child from the courtyard, and bring him into the sanctuary, even as Mary, My\nmother, grew up in the sanctuary, and she dwelt there for twelve years in the hands of the\nangels until she came out into the world.   And I was incarnate of her, because I was\npleased with her more than with any other woman.  And I am pleased with the child, for I\nhave made him pure, and I have created him; for he is of the Holy Spirit.  And his food and\ndrink shall not be of that which is on the earth, but from the kingdom of heaven.”  And the\nangel of the Lord went down quickly to where the child was, at his mother’s breast, and he\ncarried him upon his wings, even as a woman carrieth her child.  And his mother, and\n\nthose who were there, were frightened when they saw the angel carrying him on his wings,\nand kissing him on his face.  And he bore him up to the seventh heaven, and brought him\nbefore God, and God blessed him and said unto the angel, “Take him to My mother that\nshe may bless him, and kiss him as she kissed Me.  And take him also to the fathers of\nolden time, Adam, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and to all the prophets and apostles, that\nthey may embrace him, and to all the martyrs and the monks, and take him also to the\nchildren who were slain, for My sake, by the hand of Herod.  And tell all of them at the\nlast day, when all the world shall perish, and when all of you shall be with him.”  And He\nalso said, “Bring him to me.”  Then the angel forthwith took him where God commanded,\nand laid him down with our Lady Mary, and she kissed him, and embraced him.  And the\nangel also took him to where all the righteous were assembled, and they all embraced him;\nand then he brought him back and [set him] before God.  And our Lord said unto him, “I\nwill be with thee; be strong in everything which shall come on thee.  All the souls of men\nshall be saved by thee.  And when the story of the child and his faith is noised abroad there\nshall come unto him many men, and priests, and bishops from Egypt, and Mesr (Cairo),\nand Nehisa, and from the district of Sabser; and he shall love pilgrims.”  One day when\nour father Gabra Manfas Kedus was at prayer, [the angel] came unto him, and said unto\nhim, “Come, go up into heaven even as I bore thee thither before”; and he took him, and\ncarried him on his wing, and made him go up to heaven, and he brought him before God. \nAnd our Lord brought Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the Fifteen Prophets, and the\nTwelve Apostles, and all the martyrs, and He brought all the saints and said unto them as\nHe placed himself by him, “Rise up, and embrace him that was born after you, and who\nfighteth even as ye did, and whose glory shall be exalted.  And I will be with him until My\ncoming, and he shall go with you, and he shall resemble me in purity like the angels.  He\nshall dwell at My right hand, and ye shall be with him.”  And He sent to our father His\nPerson in His Trinity and He stretched out His hands, and embraced him, and He kissed\nhis mouth, and He said unto him, “There be many souls whom thou shalt make to escape\nthe Judgment through thy prayers and thy supplication.  Get thee far from men.  The blind\nand the sick shall be healed through thy prayer.  Henceforward withdraw thyself [from\nmen] and get thee into the Inner Desert.  Dwell with the lions and the panthers; the lions\nshall be sixty in number and the panthers sixty also.”  And the saint said unto our Lord,\n“What will the lions and the panthers feed upon and what will they eat?”  And He said\nunto him, “If thou treadest on the ground with thy foot they will lick the dust of thy foot,\nand they will be satisfied until they obtain food; [and this shall be] until thy coming to\nMe.”  When the good angels heard these words they marveled, and when they saw the\nsaint naked, and without raiment, they kissed him, and embraced him.   And the angel\nbrought him down quickly to his former abode.  And his hair grew, and it grew thick all\nover his limbs, and the hair of his head was seven cubits long, and the hair of his mouth\n(i.e. his beard) was one cubit long.  Each day he healed blind men, and lepers, and sick\nfolk; and their number was fifty thousand.  And our father was exceedingly sorry that men\nknew of his work, and his labour, and he said, “I will arise and depart from this place so\nthat men may know nothing about me, and may not bestow upon me the vain praise of this\nworld.”  And he departed from that place, and came into the Inner Desert, and dwelt there;\nand the people missed him, and were very sorry, because he had worked miracles for them,\nand they wept and lamented with a great lamentation.  And he lived in this wise for more\nthan one hundred years, until old age came on him.  Let now go back to our former subject\nwhen we said that he came into the desert, and withdrew himself from men; and he dwelt\non the right side of the desert for many years.  During the heat of summer, and the cold of\nwinter, he wore no clothing on his body, but he went naked, and his girdle was made of\nplaited hair.  He prayed standing in the cold of dawn, naked.  By excessive sufferings he\nmelted his body, and hardened his bones (?), and he used to say unto his soul, “Know that\nthou wilt have to stand naked before God.”  He devoted himself strenuously to prayer and\nfasting, and bowings, and to innumerable and ceaseless vigils by day and by night until at\nlength his body dried up, and his skin became stretched tightly over his bones.  He had no\nfood except, at times, the fruit of trees, or roots, or plants, and sometimes the grass and\nberries whereon the dwellers in the desert feed.  He took no care whatsoever to provide for\nhis body in anything.  The angels used to visit him, because he was like unto them in his\nspeech and acts.  Among the saints of olden times and those of later times, who is there\n\nthat can be compared with him upon earth?  There is not one who did not eat the bread of\nearth, or drink water, or wear raiment, but he never prepared anything for his body.  Verily\nGabra Manfas Kedus was like unto the fowls of heaven, for he thought nothing about the\nfood of this world, but he hungered and thirsted for God [only]; and for this reason his\nfood was the bread of heaven, and his drink came from the Garden (Paradise).  He knew\nthat it was not a lie the word of God, Who said, “Be of good cheer, have no doubt about\napparel, nor desire as to raiment” (Matthew vi, 25 f.).  And God covered his whole body\nwith hair, even like the hair which covereth the goat (or, sheep), and his fine beard was a\ngarment which covered his body, now it was as black as a raven, and was plaited like\nbyssus.  The awe which he inspired was like that of the lion, and it was frightening and\nterrifying.  His stature was like that of the palm, and the odor of him was as sweet as the\nscent of a mass of pistachios, of the costliest kind; his odor had the smell of the food of the\ndesert.  His face was like the face of an angel of God, his beard was a round mass (?), and\nhis . . . was in his mouth.  Even if I were to think of declaring the number of his words, I\ncould not enumerate them, for they were far more numerous than the grains of sand of the\nsea and the drops of the rain.  Who hath [not] admired thy contending more than those of\nevery man?  And I will exalt thee above every man, and above heaven, and earth, and sun,\nand moon, and stars.  Was there ever any limit to one of thy footsteps?  The prophets and\nthe Apostles our (sic) kinsmen speak of thee, the angels bear thee up on their wings, our\nLady Mary calleth thee “my beloved,” and loveth thee even as she loved her Son.  And\nwhen he had finished making a prayer, the angels came unto him, according to their wont,\nand said unto him, “What dost thou require, O bold man?”  And he said unto them, “I\nwould see God, even as the saints, who were before me, saw Him, and as the Apostles saw\nHim, and also as the martyrs saw Him, when they were destroyed in the towns, and as the\nrighteous saw Him in the desert and in [their] cells (or, caves).”  When the angels heard his\nword they departed, and told our Lord Jesus Christ all that he had said unto them.  And\nstraightway the heavens were opened, and the tabernacle of fire was uncovered, which\nfour beasts carried, but did not touch; and there were four and twenty priests of heaven\nholding their censers standing before Him.  And our Lord appeared, and the archangels,\neach one according to his rank, sitting upon his holy throne, in his own person; and the\nThree were seated--Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost; and he saw Three Persons and Three\nBeings, and all the angels and archangels in their hosts were praising Him.  When our\nfather Gabra Manfas Kedus saw this, he was afraid and trembled.  And our Lord said unto\nhim, “Be strong and fear not in seeing Me, for I have given thee a bold heart, that thou\nmayest look at Me Myself, even as Abukalamsis (i.e. John of the Apocalypse) looked upon\nMe.  What dost thou wish for, and what dost thou ask of Me?  I have come to thee that\nthou mightest see Me; what thou wishest I will do for thee, My beloved one, whom I chose\nbefore thou hadst being, and I have made thee pure, My chosen one.  Thou hast dwelt in\nthe desert seventy or eighty years at a time, thou hast wandered through the deserts\ndoubting nothing, thou hast not feared to dwell with lions, and thou hast endured, and been\nof good cheer even unto death.  And now, verily, I will not refuse what thou shalt ask of\nMe; whatsoever thou desirest I will perform for thee.”  When our father heard God utter\nthis great mystery, he rejoiced and said, “My Lord and my God, I am not worthy that Thou\nshouldst do for me as Thou hast done for others like me.  Now, grant me ten mercies. \nHave mercy for my sack upon the men of the land of Gabota, who are sinners, for Thou\ndidst not come into the world to call the righteous, who have no need to repent, but to turn\nsinners to repentance.  Remember, O Lord, those in the Judgment, whose tears flow like\nthe waters of winter, and who gnash their teeth, and who acted as they did in ignorance,\nSatan having led them into error.  Have mercy upon them, O Lord, and shew compassion\nunto them.”   And our Lord said unto our father Gabra Manfas Kedus, “They say hard\nthings.  It hath been head that I do not do unto them as unto the others, who are righteous\npeoples, and are pure, and have borne toil upon earth.  And as to that which thou askest\nMe; I do not destroy a monk for the sake of one sin.  If his wickednesses are many, and his\nsins are many, after he hath entered the fire he becometh subject for judgment.  When he\nbeseecheth Me with great labour I make the soul of that man to go forth from him, and I\nscatter it among the winds, and not a trace of it is ever found; at the resurrection of the\ndead [it is] not in the abode of the righteous, or in the abode of sinners.  In thy case it is not\nthus; according to My mercy I will have mercy upon thee, for I have given thee a promise\n\nthat I will do whatsoever thou askest Me.”  When our father heard [this], he rejoiced and\nbowed his face.  And all the heavenly beings rejoiced and said, “Redemption is with our\nGod.  Amen.”  And our father also said unto God, “How great is [Thy] mercy, my Lord?” \nAnd God said, “To each of thy years according to the length of thy days I will add two\nyears”; and forthwith the days of our father were made to be three hundred years.  And our\nLord said unto the archangels, “Go ye and bring souls forth from judgment, and release\nthem and give them to the blessed Gabra Manfas Kedus.”  And the seven angels went\ndown to the Gahanam of fire, the place of sinners.  At that moment came ‘Abd Almakos,\nthe angel of Gahanam, who hath power over the tortures of sinners, and brought out there\nfrom the men of the land of Gabota.  And the number of the souls who went forth from\njudgment was thirty thousand, and [the seven angels] led them on their way, and guided\nthem--namely Michael and Gabriel, each with his pilgrims, Saku’el and Ramu’el, each\nwith his great ones, and Fanu’el blew a trumpet before them.  And the other angels were\nuttering cries of joy, until they came before the throne of God in the heavens, and saying,\n“Glory to God in the heavens, and peace upon earth, His good will to men.”  And God said\nunto our father Gabra Manfas Kedus, “The men who are in the world shall not see thee,\nthat is to say, the priests, and the monks and the believers; only those who are good like\nthyself who visitest them.  And thou shalt not appear to the angels except by thy wish. \nThy chariot shall be the winds, and thy goings shall be like theirs without noise.  Fly from\nthe east to the west, and from the north to the south, and from behind the earth to the north,\nand thou shalt be able to come to any place by means of the winds.  And from henceforth,\nO blessed Gabra Manfas Kedus, My beloved, whenever thou wishest look upon Me, My\nFather, and the Holy Spirit, the Three of us thus always.  And moreover, go to the country\nof Ethiopia, and in that land there are souls which thou hast to bring forth from judgment.”\nWhen our father heard the words of the Lord his face shone and his mind rejoiced, and he\nsaid unto Him, “My Lord and my God, who shall guide me to that country, and how shall I\nknow the road thither?  For I have heard men say from my childhood that the country of\nEthiopia is far away.”  And our Lord said unto him, “Go, and My power shall bring thee\nthither, and My angels shall not be far from thee, for thou art honorable even as are they. \nAs for Me, even as thou wishest, thou shalt find Me, and according as thou hast asked Me\nI will do for thee.”  After our Lord had given the promise to His servant He disappeared\nfrom him, and the angels returned, saying, “Glory,” and, shouting with joy with David the\nprophet, they cried, “Go up into the heights.  Thou hast led captive captivity, and Thou\nhast given Thy grace to the children of man.”  And those souls which had come forth from\njudgment went into the Garden of Delight, with honor and praise. And the heights of\nheaven were filled with joy when [the angels] saw this wonderful and astonishing sight,\nthe like of which had never been seen from the creation of the world to the time of the\ncoming of Christ.  Grant unto me, O Lord, an understanding heart so that I may be able to\nknow the work which Thou didst perform for our father Gabra Manfas Kedus, the like of\nwhich Thou didst not do for the prophets, and the patriarchs, and the other saints of the\nmonastery and the desert; not that a man [who] hath done the work which Thou gavest him\ncould do what Thou Thyself dost  What then?  Our father was able to fly in the air, and to\ngo round the sea of fire, [and to bring out] thousands of souls.  He did not do this by the\nstrength of his natural body which was water, fire, dust and wind, and there was no other\nlike him; except Adam, the first [man] created.  Adam was not able to go about, and to go\nout from Sheol until our Redeemer came.  O Gabra Manfas Kedus, what is the sum of the\ngrace, and great kindness, and glory, and exaltation, wherewith thou was provided by\nGod?  When I think of describing thy strife my mind becometh light (i.e. unsettled), like\nthat of a man who hath drunk old wine, with joy, and it soareth and it cometh back, and\nsaith, “How long and how many days should I require to come to an end of his history; for\nthe matters which concern him are very many and are countless.”  When our father Gabra\nManfas Kedus looked upon the land of Gabota he saw that there was in him the faculty of\nknowing what was hidden, and what was manifest.  Moreover he knew the mysteries of\nthe heavens, and what was in the earth, and he knew when priests were pure, and he was\nable to see when the Holy Ghost descended.  The deeds of sinners were manifest before\nhim, and they were clear in his eyes as in a mirror, for he knew everything relating to the\nspirit.  And our father Gabra Manfas Kedus saw in the land of Gabota that the people hid\n\nthemselves in the church at the time of the Offering, now the number of these amounted to\ntwo hundred.  And when the Offering was being consecrated the Holy Spirit descended\nupon that altar, and our good father rejoiced when he saw the descent of the Holy Spirit. \nAnd he also watched when the people received the Offering, and none partook except\nthose whose deeds were good and whose hearts were right concerning the mystery of the\nspiritual Offering.  And our father said unto the angel, “What is the sin of those who have\nnot received the Spirit?”  And the angel said unto our honorable father, “Behold, the sin of\nthose who have not received the Spirit is great before God.”  And our father turned and he\nsaw the Satans driving the people with fiery whips from the hall of the church, until they\ncame to their houses.   And Satan himself rejoiced because they had become his\ncompanions, and they were all destroyed, and there were left among them only those who\nhad wished for repentance; and Satan rejoiced because he found certain poor folk cast out. \nNow these were sinners who had not repented for their life upon earth, and they became\nsoldiers of Satan.  When our father saw this wonderful thing, he sorrowed and wept, and\nhe said, “My Lord and my God, Thy people have been made captives, and carried off, and\nthere are not left two hundred men, but four who have eaten (?) the ephod of Thy Body. \nHe saith, Thou givest (or, sellest) Thy people without price” (Psalm xliv, 12).  When our\nfather had said this he wept, and he departed to make prayers near the place (?) of the\nApostles, and when he had arrived there he fixed his gaze on the island of water near the\nplace where he dwelt formerly.  And our Lord saw him and said unto His blessed servant,\n“I will shew mercy unto thee, and in each day I will give thee sixty thousand [souls],\nnamely on My Birthday, and on thy birthday, and on the day of My Baptism, and on the\nday of My Resurrection; on each of these days [each year] I will give thee as an act of\ngrace sixth thousand souls.  If Satan hath carried off souls thou must take them from the\nJudgment:  I have left none to Satan, I have given [all] to thee.”  When Satan heard this he\nwept with a great weeping, saying, “Ever since this wretched man was created and born I\nhave been bound with fetters.  Where can I go from this wretched man who by fasting and\nprayer hath taken my captives and carried them of, the captives whom I took and led\nastray by my arts, and carried off into the Great Judgment, before he was born.”  And\nuttering these words he wished to die.   And when the spirit-beings of heaven, and the\nbeings of earth heard [this], they rejoiced, and laughed, and brought out the souls who\nwere in the land of Egypt with much labour, and fasting and prayer.   In one day the\ncontinuous bowings [of our father] amounted to forty thousand, and during each forty\nthousand [he recited] the One Hundred the Fifty Psalms of David, and he sang the Fifteen\n[Books of] the Prophets, and the Prayer of Solomon, and the Praises of our Lady Mary,\nand besides these he bowed his face three hundred times to the right and three hundred\ntimes to the left.  All this he did in one day and one night.  Through such work as this the\nsouls of sinners gained salvation, and our father by his prayer made the Satans weep, and\nexhausted the power of Satan and destroyed the sting of his poison, and carried him bound\ninto captivity.   After this [our father] went forth from Ethiopia with lions and hyaenas\naccompanying him; the number of the lions and hyaenas which went before him was\nthirty, and the number of those which followed him was thirty.  And angel of God, whose\nname was Gabriel, guided him, and our father was mounted upon a chariot of the spirit,\nand those beasts were with him.  And the angel brought him to the land of Kabd, and then\nhe took him to Zekuela, on the highland of the earth, and our father stood on the sea-shore,\nand looked east, and west, and the south, and north.  And he saw the sins of the [men of]\nEthiopia, and they were spread out before his eyes and planted in his brain.  And he said\nunto God, “I swear unto Thee by Thy Living Name, that I will not go forth from this sea,\nand that I will not stand upon my feet.”  And he sat thus for forty days and forty nights,\nand a voice came unto him from heaven, saying, “Whosoever shall commemorate thee and\nshall call upon thy name I will give unto thee.”  And our father said unto the angel, “All\nEthiopia hath not been taught; I will not go away from this sea.”  And the angel departed\nfrom him, and he dwelt in this wise for one hundred years; and all his body perished, and\nhis blood was poured out from him, until all the water of the sea resembled blood, and all\nhis bones appeared like crystal.  And the devils came and smote him, from the east and\nfrom the west, from the south and from the north, in one day five hundred devils smote\nhim with their darts all day long, for one hundred years.  And his bones dwindled and\nbecame like sharp stones, and among the men who were before him, from Stephen the\n\nmartyr to Peter, the chief of the Apostles, and among all the martyrs who died for Christ,\nthere was none who displayed in one day the wonderful things which he made manifest. \nAfter this our Lord came and stood on the sea-shore, and He said unto our father, “Rise up\nand go forth, I have given thee Ethiopia”; and he found his bones like the eye of a needle. \nAnd He sought for him, and made him as he was at first.  And He sent him to Kabd, and\nthen He took him up into heaven; and he dwelt for seven years in the lower part of heaven,\nbut above the sun.  After this He sent him into the land of Kabd, and he lived standing\nupright like a pillar for six months, and he gazed into heaven, and he neither dropped his\neyelids nor bowed his head, and his hands were stretched out towards heaven.  After this\nSatan came to him in the form of a black raven, and he found his bones suspended in the\nheavens which covered [them], and he sat upon his head, and he pecked at his eyes, and\ndug out his eyeballs.  After this our father remained [blind] for ninety-eight [years], he\nprayed continually, and ceased not in that land.  Then Michael and Gabriel came to him,\nand they stood in front of his face, and together they breathed upon him, and his eyes saw\nand his vision became seven times brighter than the sun.  And they said unto him, “Depart\nto Zekuala, that thou mayest kill thine enemies, and great strength shall be given unto thee\nfrom heaven and from earth”; and after this they went up into heaven.  And our father rose\nup and went to Zekuala (sic), and he found on the road three tired men of the mountains,\nand they were resting close by their dwelling in the shade.   And Abba Gabra Manfas\nKedus looked at them and said in his mind, “I will hide from them.”  And they made haste\nand cried out, saying, “Do not forsake us at the throne of God.  Carry us a little way on thy\nback.”  And our father came, and saw that they were all broken old men, and that they\nwere covered with grey hair.  And he lifted up one of them upon his back and he carried\nhim and brought him a distance of one stade.  And the old man said unto him, “Now thou\nhast tired thyself, for thou neither eatest, nor drinkest, nor weepest.”  And our father said\nunto him, “By what dost thou know me?”   And the old man said, “Go and bring my\ncompanions”; and he turned and went, leaving the old man there, and he came to the place\nwhere the other two old men were, and he took one of them and brought him back to the\nold man and joined him.  And he said unto them, “Whence have ye come?  The odor of\nyou is sweet and rejoiceth the heart, and carrieth away the senses.”  And the three old men\nrose up and stood up, and the three of them seemed to be one.  And they said unto him,\n“We will carry thee even as thou didst carry us for a little, and we will carry thee, and\nmake thee to arrive in the Seventh Heaven.”  At that moment their countenance changed,\nand they put on the awe of Godhead, and they became like flames of fire, and lightning\nflashed forth from them.  And all the angels of heaven and earth came down, and were\nterrified, and the mountains and hills descended, and fell down, and all the rocks were\nbroken in pieces and they became like dust.  At this moment the Father of Light took our\nfather and carried him on His back, and brought him to the middle of the Second Heaven. \nAnd His Son went back to him and took him, and carried him on His back, and brought\nhim from the Second Heaven to the middle of the Third Heaven, and the Holy Spirit went\nback to him and brought him to His holy and awful throne; and the Three Persons and One\nBeing sat on one throne.  And our Lord embraced him and kissed his mouth, and Father,\nSon and Holy Ghost embraced him and kissed him; as a father kisseth his son even so did\nThey kiss him and embrace him.  And He showed him the four thrones of the Prophets,\nand Apostles, and the Righteous, and the Martyrs, and there remained three double\n[thrones].  And our Lord said unto him, “Heaven, and earth, and sun, and moon, and stars,\nare insufficient to be the price of one hair of thy head.  Depart, get thee down to Zekuala,\nand drown the devils who cast away thy bones, for they are boasting and they know not\nthat I have raised thee up.  I will be in the sea, and the seven archangels shall follow thee,\nand fiery lightning shall go before thee.”  And our father flew on the back of the lightning,\nand the Three Persons sent him on his way, and returned to their throne.  And our father\ndescended and fell upon their heads with swords of fire, and the lightning's consumed\nthem, and they became ashes.  And the winds carried away their ashes, and those devils\nwere in number seven thousand two hundred, and they all perished in one day, and there\nremained not one.  After this the lightning's and the archangels went up [into heaven].  \nAnd our father departed to the land of Kabd, where there were lions, and hyaenas, and\nwolves, and serpents.  After this the saints came to him one day, led by the Holy Spirit:  (1)\nAbba Samuel of Waldebba, (2) Abba ‘Ansesa of the land of Hazlo, (3) Abba Benyam of\n\nthe lower land; and they had their lions with them.  They came to the land of Kabd, and\nour father hid himself; and they continued in praises seven days until they should find\nhim.  After the seven days certain lions, which had been hidden, went forth, and came to\nthe place where the three saints were, and they seized upon their lions and devoured their\nbodies; they devoured and licked up their bodies in a moment.   And the saints were\nterrified, and the lions disappeared.   And the saints were exceedingly sorry, and their\nsorrow was revealed unto our father.  And he rose up and came to them with the great\npower which was given unto him from heaven, and with him there were sixty lions, and\nsixty hyaenas, and angels bearing the tent of light.  And the hair of his head covered his\nwhole body like a thatch and swept the ground, and the hair of his beard and neck reached\nthe ground; and he was arrayed in his apparel.  And he came unto them with great might,\nand said unto them, “Peace be unto you, O saints of God.”  And those saints were terrified\nwhen they saw his terrifying majesty and the lions which roared before him, and the\nhyaenas which screamed and laughed like horses.  And our father said unto those saints,\n“For what purpose have ye come to me, [seeing that] I am alone in this desert place?”  And\nthose saints said unto him, “We came unto thee having known of thy holy prayers, O chief\nanchorite in all the world, and we came unto thee that we might hold converse with the\nservant of God.  When we came and did not find thee we sorrowed and wept for seven\ndays, and whilst we were praying on the seventh day thy lions came and seized our lions,\nand they ate them up and swallowed them and licked up their blood in the twinkling of an\neye.”  And our father said unto his lions, “Why did ye eat what God had not commanded\nye to eat?  Ye were ordered to eat nothing but the dust of my footsteps until the day of your\ndeaths. Cast up and throw up what ye have eaten.”  And the lions opened their mouths, and\nthrew up what thy had eaten, all the flesh and bones and blood of the saints’ lions, and\nnone of their flesh and bones remained in their bellies; and they cast up everything in the\ntwinkling of an eye.  And our father turned towards the east, and praised God, saying, “O\nThou Who didst raise up Lazarus, raise them up, but do not raise up those whom Thou hast\ngiven to Thy servants to follow them.”  Then he blessed them and their bodies, that is to\nsay, the dead bodies of the lions, and he said unto them, “Rise up by the power of God.” \nAnd the lions rose up in the twinkling of an eye, and they were as they were at first, and\nthey uttered cries, and purred, and lay down by our father, and they did homage at his\nfeet.  And those lions spoke like men, and they said unto him, “Henceforward we will\nfollow thee.  Those saints were unable to do anything for us, but thou hast raised us up and\nbrought us out from the bellies of [thy] lions”; and our father sent them away to their\nformer owners, and the saints marveled at the work of God.  And Abba Samuel said unto\nour father, “Art thou God?  We thought that thou wast a man like unto ourselves.  That\nwhich was dead thou wast raised from the belly of the lions, and what they had eaten thou\nhast made to come forth.  We have seen a marvelous thing this day!”\nOn the third day of Magabit our father fell sick, and on the Eve of the Sabbath his death\ndrew nigh.  His pain and sickness seized him so strongly, that he well nigh died; and the\nhour of his death approached.   And there came unto him several anchorites who were\nrecluses, whose names were, Fere Kedus, and Zara Buruk, and James, and Benyam, and\nJoseph, and our father told them that he was going to die, and that God had given him a\ncovenant (or, promise).  When they heard this they wept, and sorrowed for the death of the\nsaint, for he was the chief of the anchorites.  During the early hours of the Sabbath he lived\nwith difficulty, and was exhausted, now burning and now sweating, but he never ceased to\nmake supplication to his God, which was his custom with every breath.  When the evening\ncame his body was in a state of collapse, and he was unable to speak, and those who were\nby him [sent] to fetch Gabra Andreas so that he might see his death and be a witness\nconcerning it.  When the anchorites came to him, they told him that the blessed man was\ngoing to die; and when he heard [this] he wept and sorrowed bitterly.  And he rose up, and\nwent to him.  And it was the evening of the Sabbath, for the day was ended, and it was the\nfirst hour of the night.  And he rose up [and went] to the place where he was, now his road\nwas far from the abode of the holy man, and the place where the honorable man was.  And\nat the fourth hour of the night he found him lying like a majestic lion in the desert where\nthere was none to terrify him and to overshadow him; and there was no one in the village\nwhich was near his road who had found him.  And he was lying with his hands spread out\n\ntowards heaven, even as our Lord Jesus Christ was extended on the wood of the Cross at\nthe time of His Passion, until the hour of His death.  And one saw the light which was\nupon him, and the grace of God which was on his face, and the ruddiness of his beauty,\nand his beard which was as white as snow.  When the seventh hour of the night came his\nsoul separated itself from his body.  At that moment a sound was heard from heaven, like\nthe sound of thunder, and there came down lamps which were like snow, and like unto\ncrystal, and which thundered and rolled down from the heavens to the earth, each having\nthe form and similitude of the other, and they shone like the sun, and moon, and stars.  \nThose who were there were terrified and afraid, because of the great awfulness of the\nthings which were taking place, and which had come upon them; and they were unable to\ntouch any part of his body.  And after his death they withdrew themselves and fled, and\nthey lost their senses by reason of the fear and trembling which had come upon them. \nNow the earth trembled, and the mountains quaked, and there was a mighty noise at the\nmoment of the departure of the soul of the saint.  And those saints stood afar off that they\nmight see and hear the mysteries of heaven and earth which were being performed.  And\nGod fortified the minds of those saints, so that they might understand what had happened\nto the honorable man, our father, and might testify that they had seen God in His Three\nPersons descend to our father before his soul [departed].  And Jesus said unto him (?), “I\nhave come to give thee oblations for thy commemoration.  Whosoever shall write or have\nwritten the book of thy strife shall pass with thee boldly, and his abode shall be in the\nmansions of light, and I will write his name on My awful throne.   Whosoever shall\ncommemorate thee greatly and unceasingly shall pass through the lake of fire, and shall\nstand unashamed before thee.  If he giveth bread to the hungry I will give him the bread of\nheaven, and he shall nevermore hunger.  If he giveth drink to the thirsty I will make him to\ndrink milk with the babes for ever.  If he giveth incense, even though he be polluted, he\nshall be with thee.   If he give flour I will make him to draw nigh unto the heavenly\nJerusalem with thee.  If he give oil on the day of thy commemoration he shall be with\nAbraham, Isaac, and Jacob-Israel.  If he bring a lamp, he shall traverse the sea of fire and\ndarkness, with twelve lamps of light, which shall be seven times brighter than the sun.  If\nthey assemble on the day of thy commemoration, I will make them to assemble on Mount\nZion with all the saints.”  And our father entreated God and said unto Him, “I have lived\nthree hundred and sixty-nine years, I have never drunk water, I never thought about food\nfor my body, and have eaten only wood (i.e. herbs), and the fruits of the desert, nor about\nclothing for my body, and I continued to be naked, and if I had lived in the sea I should\nhave lived like the fish and the hippopotamus.  I lived in a tree like the birds, and I lived\nlike the stag in the mountains, with the lion, the wolf, the panther and the serpent.  This is\nthe reward which Thou givest to the saints.  I beseech Thee, O Lord, to be pleased to speak\nto me.”   And our Lord answered and said unto him, “If the sin of a man is not repented\nfor, the man who hath committed it, not only if he be a Christian, but if he be an ‘Arminu,\nI will give unto thee if he celebrate thy commemoration, and he shall be saved, and he\nshall be with thee.  When thy soul is separated [from thy body] on the fifth day of Magabit\nthey shall make twelve . . . as for Mary, My mother.  They shall make a habitation and I\nwill bless their assemblies.  If he be old, I will give him a good seat.  And now ascend into\nthe houses of light.  And take twelve crowns, and ten thousand lamps in thy right hand,\nand ten thousand lamps in thy left hand, one thousand before thee and one thousand\nbehind thee, and twelve precious stones of light, and take horses of fire to bear thee.”  And\nour father answered and said unto Him, “O our Lord Jesus Christ, if men celebrate my\ncommemoration with right hearts, unto how many generations wilt Thou give them unto\nme?”  And the Lord said unto him, “I will give them unto thee for fifteen generations.” \nThen they heard a great voice which cried out and said, “Take the body of Gabra Manfas\nKedus, and carry it away, and let his grave be in Jerusalem, on the right-hand side of the\naltar.”  And Michael and Gabriel and all the angels uttered cries of joy before his holy\nsoul, and each of them cried out unceasingly, and the angels carried away his body to bury\nit as God commanded them; and thirty desert anchorites came to meet it.  And the hosts of\nangels placed his soul in the houses of light, saying, “Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, all\nthe time, now and always, and for ever and ever.”\nSalutation to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.\n\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

therefore hath He appointed me and sent me to\npreach to those who are in captivity, and to those who are in prison, and to set them free,\nand to the blind that they may see the light, and to those who are bound that they be set\nfree, and to preach the year of the mercy of God” (Isaiah 61:1-2).  And David saith: “Thou\nhast blessed the crown of the year [with] mercy, and the desert is satisfied with dew by\nThy blessing” (Psalm 65:11).\nOn this day also Job the righteous man washed in the water of the Tekaze and was healed\nof all his sickness.  And the people were in the habit, when the river Tekaze was full of\nwater, of dipping themselves in the new water, whereby they were blessed for all the rest\nof the year.\nOn this day died the holy Apostle Bartholomew, who was one of the Twelve Apostles.  To\nthis apostle the lot fell that he was to go to the city of El-wah (the great Oasis, Al-Hargah). \nHe and Peter went together to the people there, and they preached to them, and called them\nto the knowledge of God.  After that they performed before them signs and great wonders,\nwhich terrified their hearts.  After this Peter contrived to go into the city, and there he sold\nBartholomew to be a slave, and Bartholomew worked in the vineyard with his master. \nAnd when he was preparing the young plants for planting out, they burst into flower and\nbore fruit immediately.  When the son of the governor of that city died, Bartholomew the\napostle raised him up from the dead.   And all the people believed, and Bartholomew\nstrengthened them in the knowledge of God.  After this our Lord Jesus Christ commanded\nhim to go to the city of Barbar (i.e. the city of the Barbarians), and He sent to him Andrew\nthe apostle with his helper to help him.   And the people of that city were exceedingly\nwicked, and they would not receive the apostles who were working before them signs and\nwonders.  And God commanded one of the Dog-faced cannibals to submit to the apostles,\nand not to resist them in anything, which they ordered him to do, and they took him with\nthem to that city.  And the men of that city brought out wild beasts against the apostles to\neat them up, and straightway that Dogface rose up against those wild beasts, and rent them\nasunder, and he also slew a great many of the men of that city.  Because of this all the\npeople were afraid and they turned, and did homage at the feet of the apostles, and they\nsubmitted to them, and they entered the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ--to Him be glory! \nAnd he appointed priests over them, and built churches for them, and the apostles left\nthem praising God.\nAnd Bartholomew the apostle departed to the cities, which were on the seacoast, whereof\nthe people knew not God, and he preached unto them and converted them to the\nknowledge of God.  And they believed on our Lord Jesus Christ.  And Bartholomew the\napostle commanded the men to be pure, and to be remote from fornication.  When Agrippa\nthe king heard of him he was exceedingly angry with him, and he commanded his servants\n\nto put the Apostle Bartholomew in a hair sack and to fill the sack up with sand, and to cast\nhim into the sea; and they did so.  And thus Bartholomew consummated his martyrdom.\nOn this day died the holy father Abba Melyos, Archbishop of the great city of Alexandria,\nthe third from Mark, the apostle and evangelist, and this archbishop was appointed in the\ntwelfth year of the reign of Vespasian the Emperor of Rome, fifty-four years after the\nAscension of our Lord Jesus Christ.  He pastured and guarded the flock of our Lord Jesus\nChrist nobly, and he sat on the Episcopal throne twelve years.  And he pleased God and\ndied in peace.\nAnd on this day died the righteous and excellent Abba Melki.  The fathers of this righteous\nman were among the nobles of Kuelzem (Kolsum, i.e. Clysma), which city is on the\nborders of Egypt; they were rich in gold and silver, and they gave alms to the poor and\nneedy.  His father loved God exceedingly, and he had no son.  One day he saw the children\nlearning their lessons, and in their hands were tablets whereon were written, “Let us\nremember our fathers who have taught us by their lives so that we may become children of\nGod.   O God, make their souls to have rest in the heavens with the righteous and the\nmartyrs.”  And when the father of Abba Melki heard these words from the mouths of the\nchildren he was very sorrowful saying, “Woe to me, for I have no son.   Who will\nremember me when I die?”  And he and his wife gave themselves up with zeal to fasting,\nand prayer and the giving of offerings.  And God heard their petition and He gave them\ntwo children at once, a boy and a girl; and they rejoiced greatly in them.  And the father\nbrought them up as Christians, and he called the boy Melki, and his sister Sefna, which is\nbeing interpreted “Dove.”  And he had them reared very carefully.  And when the boy was\nseven years old his father took Melki to a teacher, and he taught him all the Books of the\nNew and Old Testaments.  And the Holy Spirit came upon him in full measure, and he did\nnot play with the other children or indulge in games with them, but he read the Scriptures\nday and night.  And when the boy was twelve years old, the parents of the children called\nhim and spoke with him about their wish to take a wife for him, so that they might have a\nmemorial; but Melki was not pleased with this, and pretending to agree with them he said,\n“I consent to your words, and that which ye order me to do I will do.”  Now his soul\nwished to flee from the world.  Then Abba Melki said unto his father, “I wish to make a\nfestival for the children who are at school with me”; and his father gave him ten hundred\ndinars in gold so that he might make a feast according to his desire, and he ordered the\nservants and the waiting men to minister unto him according to his wish.   Then Abba\nMelki mounted his horse, and went out before his father and said unto his serving men,\n“Take ye one hundred dinars in gold and make haste and prepare a feast for us; I will go\nalone and invite my companions thereto.”  And his serving men hearkened to his voice,\nand turned away, and he departed by himself.  The money, which he had, he distributed\namong the poor and needy, and his horse he gave to a certain poor man, and he had\nnothing left except the clothes, which were on him.  And as his return was delayed his\nserving men sought for him, but they could not find him, and they turned back weeping;\nand they told his father and mother and they wept a bitter weeping.  His sister’s eyes by\nreason of her excessive weeping went blind and she died.  And Abba Melki went to Debra\nTur, which was the monastery of his mother’s brother Mar ‘Awgin.  And this ‘Awgin was a\nrighteous man and he worked many signs, and under his authority there were seventy-two\nchosen monks.  And Abba Melki prostrated himself at his feet, and he said unto him, “I\nwish to dwell under thy shadow, and I wish thee to array me in the garb of the monk.” \nAnd Abba ‘Awgin said unto him, “From what city comest thou?”  And he told him that\nKuelzem was his city, and that he was the son of ‘Awgin’s sister; and when ‘Awgin heard\nthis he rejoiced with a great joy, and he permitted him to be a probationer for three years,\nand he arrayed him in the garb of monasticism.  And he contended with such great vigor in\nthe ascetic life and kept such strict vigil always, that his fame was heard of in all the\ncountry of Persia.  And when he had been a monk for three years God gave unto him the\ngift of healing and he was able to drive out devils by his word.  One day whilst he was\nwalking about by himself reciting the Psalms he came to a place where there was a hollow,\nand in the hollow was a fig tree, and there were a great many shepherds weeping there. \nAnd Abba Melki said unto them, “Why do ye weep?”  And they said unto him, “The son\nof the governor of the city was eating figs here, and whilst he was doing so a great snake\n\ncame out and swallowed him up, and the boy hath gone into its belly.”  And whilst they\nwere telling him this, the father of the boy with the people of the city arrived, and their\nclothes were rent and they were beating their faces; and he made entreaty to Mar Melki on\nbehalf of his son.  And Mar Melki said unto him, “Fear not, O my son, believe in God and\nthou shalt see a wonderful thing,” and he turned his face towards the east and stretched out\nhis hands and prayed for a long time.  And when he had finished his prayer he summoned\nthe serpent in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and commanded to cast up the boy from\ninside him; and he cast up the boy who had suffered no pain whatsoever.  And Satan, who\nwas inside the serpent, cried out and said, “Whither can I go from thee, O Melki, thou man\nof Kuelzem?” And having said these words he dissolved himself into smoke.  And when\nthe father of the boy saw that his son was alive he brought gold and silver to the holy\nman.  And Melki refused to accept it from him, but he said unto him, “Let us become\npartners in the building of a monastery for me.”  And the father of the boy rejoiced and he\nbuilt him a monastery, which contained 300 cells for the monks, and he enclosed the\nbuilding with a wall and provided iron gates therefore.   Whilst they were building the\nchurch they found in one corner a huge stone, which could not be raised by 300 men, but\nby the prayer of this righteous man the church was built out of that stone even as the\nbuilder wished.  Then there assembled there 500 souls and they were chosen monks.  And\nthe report of the holy man was heard throughout the country, and the people used to bring\nunto him the sick folk who were suffering from sicknesses of every kind, and those who\nwere possessed of devils, and they were all healed of their diseases through his prayer, and\nthe men of Persia and Rome were saved through the intercession of this righteous man. \nAnd when Satan, who is the enemy of good, saw this righteous man, he was jealous of\nhim, and he went to the daughter of the King of Rome and drove her silly, and she dried\nout and said, “There is no healing for me except through Melki of Kuelzem.”  And the\nking her father hearkened unto her, and sent 400 men from his army out unto all directions\nso that they might bring Abba Melki with care to him, and he took an oath that if they did\nnot do so he would cut off their heads with the sword.  And the soldiers who had been sent\nout found the holy man with difficulty, and they bowed down at his feet, and they told him\nthe king’s message, and about the illness of his daughter, [and said,] “Tell us what thou\nsayest.”  And Abba Melki said unto him, “I am an old man, and I cannot travel to Rome.” \nAnd the soldiers said unto him, “If thou wilt not go with us the king hath promised to put\nus to death.”  When the holy man heard this he was very sorry, and he said unto them, “O\nmy children, go ye your way, I and you will meet at the gates of Rome”; and when they\nheard his words they departed.   And at the end of the year, on the day when he knew\nthrough the Holy Spirit that they would arrive in Rome, he prayed a prayer to God, and the\nHoly Spirit lifted him up and bore him to the gates of Rome.  And when the envoys found\nthe holy man there they rejoiced greatly and they told the king of his arrival; and the king\nrejoiced greatly and went out and received him and brought him into his palace and seated\nhim upon his throne, and told him concerning his daughter’s sickness.  And Abba Melki\nordered that she be brought, and when they had brought her, the devil hurled her down and\nrent her until they thought that she was dead.  And straightway Abba Melki rose up and\nprayed a long time, and he sprinkled water over her face and anointed her with oil, and he\ncommanded Satan in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ to go forth from her.  And Satan\nwent forth from her in the form of a black man, and the holy men seized him, and shut him\nup in the house, and marked him with the sign of the Cross so that he should not go out. \nAnd when the king saw this, he bowed down at Abba Melki’s feet, and he brought to him\nmany possessions for the needs of his monastery, and the holy man refused them.  And the\nking said unto him, “O my father, dwell here and I will build thee a monastery”; and the\nholy man said, “I cannot forsake my children.”  And the holy man dwelt in Rome for a few\ndays, and healed their demoniacs.  And when he went out to return to his city, the king\nrose up and set him on his way with [an escort of] soldiers, and he came to the gates of the\npalace.  And the holy man saw a great mass of stone, which had been hollowed out and\nhad been placed at the mouth of a fountain of running water, and a stone bowl so that\nhorses might drink out of it.  And he said unto the king, “Give me these stones for the use\nof my monastery.”  And the king said unto him, “Who will carry for thee the stones which\ntwelve men could not lift and carry them outside the city.   If however, thou hast the\nstrength [to carry them] do thou what thou pleasest.”  Then the holy man brought the Satan\n\nforth from the place wherein he had bound him, and he suspended the hollow stone from\nhis neck, and he bound the bowl on the top of his head, and he ordered him to go before\nhim.  When the king saw this he marveled exceedingly, and he turned and glorified God. \nAnd Saint Abba Melki made the Satan to come into his monastery carrying these stones,\nand the ordered him to set them down at the gates, and they are there to this day.  And he\nshut up the Satan in a cave and sealed him with the sign of the Cross so that he should not\ngo forth again and tempt men.  And when this holy man had been a monk for forty and\nfive years, a voice came unto him from heaven saying, “Behold the day of thy death hath\ndrawn nigh, and there remains unto thee three days only before thou shalt enter into\neverlasting joy.”  Then the holy man summoned his children and he commanded them to\nserve God and to keep themselves away from the error of Satan.  After three days there\ncame unto him the fathers of the monks, Abba Antony, and Abba Macarius, and Abba\nSinoda, and Abba Besya, and Abba Pachomius, and they said unto him, “Come, O our\nbrother, and rejoice with us in the kingdom of the heavens.”  And when they had said this\nunto him, his soul went forth from his body and the angels took it up into glory singing as\nthey went, and they said, “He hath toiled in the world and he shall live for ever”; and they\nbrought him into the Garden of Delight.  And the archbishops, and the bishops and the\npriests assembled and they buried him in the church, and innumerable signs and wonders\ntook place at his grave.\nAnd on this day is celebrated the festival of Raguel, the angel, one of the nine archangels,\nwho informed Enoch concerning the fire which burneth, and the destruction of the world;\nand he is the angel of lights.  May the intercession of this angel be with us all.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

And on the day of the\nResurrection, when the trumpet soundeth, and dead bodies of men shall rise up by the\ncommand of their Creator.  And all the souls of men shall go each into the body whereto it\nbelongeth, and it shall rise with it, and according to its work it will either rejoice for ever,\nor suffer punishment for ever.  And the two (i.e. soul and body) will remain in the state in\nwhich they have risen forever and forever and ever.  May the prayer of this Council be\nwith us.  Amen.\nAnd on this day also a great earthquake took place in the country of Egypt and in all its\nborders, and the church of Dasya fell down at the time of the third hour of the day.  And\nthis church was in the name of Michael the archangel.  And it is said that a certain ungodly\nman asked the Christians to pay tax to him, but they would not give him anything; and\nwhen it was evening this man came with his followers and pulled down the church.  This\nhappened in the ninth year of Archbishop Abba Macarius, in the eight hundred and twenty-\neighth year of the Holy Martyrs [A.D. 1112].  May their prayers and blessing be with us. \nAmen.\nAnd on this day are commemorated Dioscoros the martyr, and Archbishop Dionysius, and\nthe martyrs who were in Tensel Yakoton, and many martyrs in Persia.  May their prayer\nand blessing, etc.\nAnd on this day died Abba ‘Anbes (Father Lion) of the country of Ethiopia.\nAnd on this day died Abba Muse (Moses) of the desert of Scete.\nWhen this man became a monk he forsook the world, and departed into the desert, and he\nput himself under the yoke of fasting and prayer until God lightened his eyes to see a\ngarden of olive trees and palm trees.  At the beginning of each month he took what fell of\nthe fruit of these trees, and ate it, and the amount of food which he was in the habit of\neating was like that of a small bird.  And his apparel was made of the fiber and bark of the\npalm.  And the heat of summer and the cold of winter attacked him, but in spite of these he\ndevoted himself to his prayer and fasting.   And he had no knowledge of letters and\nwriting.  And all the various kinds of wild animals of the desert used to visit him, and he\nmade friends with them and when the time of prayer drew nigh he made a sign to them\nwith his hand and they departed.  And when there was a time of want they would come\nand stand before him as if they wished to speak to him, and he knew through the Holy\n\nSpirit what they were seeking after, and he would bring down rain for them; and he lived\nin this manner for thirty and five years.  And Satan was jealous of him, and he disguised\nhimself and took the form of a very aged monk, and appeared in front of the cave of Muse\n(Moses) and walked along limping.  When the holy man saw him he thought that he was a\ndweller in the desert.  And he went to him and took him into his cave and he continued in\nprayer for three days.  And when the wild animals that used to visit the holy man saw these\nold men, they withdrew from him.  Then that old man asked the holy man concerning his\ncountry and his belief, and Abba Muse (Moses) told him all his work, and asked the old\nman in return concerning his city and belief.   And the old man said unto Abba Muse\n(Moses), “As for me I have lived in the world and have committed sin for many years, and\nI have begotten a daughter.  Then when I remembered the transitoriness of the world, I\ncame out into the desert and have lived herein for forty years.  I have remembered my\ndaughter and I can find no one to whom to marry her except thyself, and it is for this\npurpose that I have come hither.   When I die thou shalt bury me; I have orchards and\ngardens and thou shalt inherit them all.”  When Abba Muse (Moses) heard these words he\nwas terrified, and he said unto the old man, “How can I who am a monk do this?”  And\nthis old man brought unto him testimony from the Scriptures how Abraham, and Moses,\nand David, though they were righteous men, had married wives.  And through this the old\nman made the heart of Abba Muse (Moses) to yield.   And he showed him a beautiful\npalace, and in it there was a beautiful maiden, and there came before Abba Muse (Moses)\na vision wherein the old man was dead, and the holy man was weeping over him, and was\npreparing his body for the tomb and then burying him.  And when he went to consort with\nthe maiden a mighty wind arose and he was driven backwards.  When his senses returned\nthe palace had disappeared, and the garden, and the maiden, and he was forced to go back\nto his dwelling.  And he wished to eat a meal of the fruit of the tree from which he ate\nformerly, and the fruit was bitter in his mouth.  And when famine compelled him he went\nforth into the desert, and again he met Satan under the form of an aged pilgrim who was\ngoing to Alexandria, and he was riding an ass, and was provided with meat and drink, and\nhe took him with him and brought him into the city and left him there.   And Satan\nappeared unto him in the form of a woman who was carrying water.  And seeing him in the\ngarb of the men of the desert she asked him about himself, and he told her everything\nwhich Satan had told him; and she laughed at him in her heart, and she took him to her\nhouse and gave him meat and drink.  And she told him the affair of her marriage, and how\nshe was the daughter of a king who was dead, and how she possessed much property. \nWhen she saw that his heart inclined to her, she said to him also, “I am a Jewess and we\nare many”; and then she seduced him with many crafty arts until he denied his Faith.  And\nagain she said unto him, “Come, let us take possession of my property in the place where I\ndeposited it”; and she took him to an empty desert wherein there was no water.  And she\ntook him up to the top of a mountain, and she transformed herself before him, and she said\nunto him, “I am that Satan who leadeth very many into error.  I seduced thee from the\ndesert, and I enticed thee away from thy Faith.  Behold, thou shalt die in this desert, and\nthy soul shall go into Gehenna”; and having said these things he disappeared from him. \nAnd the holy man turned to his right hand and to his left, and there was no way to escape\nand no water to drink.  And as the matter pressed sorely upon him he fell down on the\nground and scattered dust on his face and he became dizzy and wept until his soul wished\nto be set free from him.  And God heard his cry, and He sent an angel unto him to console\nhim, and he said unto him, “Thy sin is remitted unto thee.  In three days thou shalt die and\nmy servant Samuel, the dweller in the desert, shall bury thee.”   And straightway Abba\nSamuel came to him, and gave him peace, and comforted him, and took him with him into\nthe church which ‘Agabos the king had built in the desert which was hidden from the eye\nof man, and it was the cemetery for the company of monks.  And when they offered up the\nOffering, and received the Holy Mysteries.   And there, being a press of people Abba\nSamuel departed to obtain a blessing at the grave of the saints.  And when [Abba Muse\n(Moses)] arrived there, he knelt down on his knees and died straightway; and Abba\nSamuel buried him and wrote the history of him.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

now this woman was a pagan and her parents worshipped idols.  After\nthis she came to the Bishop of Manufe (i.e. Manuf Al-’Alia, or Panouf Res, capital of the\nprovince of Manufiayyah) and believed in Christ, and said unto him, “I have believed in\nthy God.”  And after this he taught her all the Law of the Church, and he baptized her and\nher daughters in the Name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost.  Thereupon they\nlaid an accusation against her before Kaldeyanos (Claudianus), the governor of the city, \nsaying that she had become a Christian and had forsaken the worship of idols.  And the\ngovernor questioned her closely and she did not deny it, and he condemned her and her\ndaughters to be punished severely.  And she exhorted them to be patient and said unto\nthem, “Be strong, my daughters, and endure like the daughters of Sophia, my lady\n‘Angabenayt.   I am her kinswoman and ye are as her daughters Pistis, ‘Alapis and\n‘Agapis.”  And they answered and said unto her, “Fear thou not, we will follow thy steps”;\nand when they had said these things she kissed them devotedly.  And when the governor\nsaw them embracing her, he ordered his men to scourge the mother with whips in order to\nterrify the virgins.  Then her daughters saw an angel of God come down and hide the body\nof the holy woman, for the wicked men had striped her naked to beat her, and they rejoiced\nand were glad.  And whilst the men were beating their mother she never ceased to cry out,\n“I am a Christian.”  Then the governor commanded them to cut out her tongue down to the\nroot, and they did so, and even after this she ceased not to cry out and to shout at him. \nAfter this the governor commanded them to take her into the prison, and he sent his wife\nunto her to persuade her; and when she would not be persuaded he commanded them to\ncut off her head with a sword, and they did so.  And a certain woman took her body and\nhid it in her house, and she lighted a lamp before it and burnt incense to it.  Then the\ngovernor summoned her daughters, and threatened them so that they might consent to\nobey him, but when they refused him he cut off their heads one after the other;

and an angel of God came down and destroyed\nit.  And he wrote, “This is the house of Sophia\", and although the workmen wanted to cut\nit they left it written.  One day whilst the son of the king was playing with his friends\nthere, the angel of God whose name was Rafael appeared unto them and said unto them,\n“What is the name of this house?”  And the youth said, “I do not know.”  And the angel\nsaid unto him, “Tell thy father to call it the house of Sophia.\"  And the youth said unto\nhim, “Wilt thou wait here until I come back?”  And the angel said, “I will.”  And when his\nfather heard this he knew that it was an angel, and he killed his son, and said, “The angel\nwill not depart from that place because he must waif for the youth.”  And that angel is\nthere to this day waiting for the youth.  The length of that church is 709 cubits, its breadth\nis 309 cubits, its pillars are in number 366, its doors are 4, its altars are 8, its pools of water\nare 4, and the cherubim which are above the mercy seat have each two wings which\novershadow the ark of the Law of God.  And they brought here the coffer of Saint Sophia,\nand the coffers of her daughters with great honor and glory.  And they buried that woman\nwho had gathered together their bodies with them.  May the prayer of these holy women\nbe with us.  Amen.\nAnd on this day also Saint Mamas became a martyr.  His father was called Theodotus and\nhis mother was called Theophila.  This man lived in the days of the reign of Yolyanos\n(Julian) the emperor, and his position was that of governor of the city of ‘Awlatos.  The\n\nparents of this holy man were Christians, and because of their belief in Christ he had shut\nthem up in prison, and the mother of this holy man gave birth to him in prison.  After his\nfather and his mother had died in prison, a certain Christian woman took the blessed child\nand brought him up as her own son, and she called his name “Mamas,” the interpretation\nof which is “orphan,” for he had neither father nor mother.  And when he was fifteen years\nold the people brought an accusation against him before the governor saying that he was a\nChristian.   And they took him and beat him with rods, and they hung him up head\ndownwards with a heavy lump of lead tied to him, and they cast him into the sea, but he\nwas saved from the sea by the might of God.  And he hid himself under a cave and he fed\nhimself on the milk of the gamus, (i.e. buffalo), those great black animals of the desert. \nThen the governor seized him again and cast him into the fire, but he was saved from the\nfire by the power of God.  After this, the governor’s men let loose lions upon him so that\nthey might rend him asunder, but by the power of God he leaped upon the back of a lion. \nThen the governor tortured him, and his men dragged him on the ground, and tore out his\nintestines with a three-pronged iron fork.  By this torture the blessed Mamas consummated\nhis martyrdom, and received a crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  May\nhis prayer and blessing be with us.  Amen.\n[On this day also is commemorated Lebna Dengel, or Dawit (David) II Wanag Sagad,\nKing of Ethiopia from Aug. 15, 1508, to Sept. 2, 1540.]\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

And declaring that Christ hath two distinct Natures.  And when Dioscoros\nreturned, he sent to them and ordered them to bring to him the roll whereon they had\nwritten.  And they sent it to him thinking that he would write on it even as they had done. \nAnd Saint Dioscoros wrote at the foot of the roll and excommunicated them all.  And he\nalso excommunicated every one who departed from the Orthodox Faith, which our fathers\nthe Apostles, and our holy fathers the Three Hundred and Eighteen Orthodox bishops who\nassembled in Nicea laid down.   And the emperor was wroth, and he commanded that\nDioscoros should be banished to the island of Gagra.  And they took him there, and with\nhim was Abba Macarius, bishop of the city of Kaw, and four others fled.  And those six\nhundred and six bishops were sitting in Chalcedon.   And when they had taken Saint\nDioscoros to that place, there came upon him great tribulation through the bishop of that\ndistrict, for he was a Nestorian.   And he treated him with great contempt until God\n\nperformed by the hands of Saint Abba Dioscoros signs and mighty wonders, and all [the\npeople] bowed down at his feet, and were subject unto him, and they magnified his\ngreatness.  Thus God honors His chosen ones in every place.  And Abba Dioscoros said\nunto Abba Macarius, “Thou shalt receive the crown of martyrdom in the city of\nAlexandria”; and he sent him with certain believing pilgrims to the city of Alexandria, and\nthere he ended his testimony according as Dioscoros prophesied concerning him.   And\nSaint Dioscoros having ended his good fight and pleased God, departed from this\ntransitory world, and received the crown of his fidelity and entered into everlasting life. \nHe died in the island of Gagra, and they laid his body there.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Sawiros (Severianus), Bishop of the city of\nGabla (Byblos).  The name of the father of this holy man was ‘Ablaryanos (Apollinaris),\nand he studied foreign wisdom in the city of Athens.  He went to the city of Caesarea and\nstudied [Greek] philosophy and literature, and he returned to Rome and studied the\ndoctrine of the Church, and he learned by heart the Books of the Old and the New\nTestaments in a few years.  After this his parents died and they left him exceedingly great\nwealth and endless possessions, and he wished to give them all to Christ so that he might\nreceive it back a hundredfold.  He built a great house wherein might be received travelers,\nand pilgrims and strangers, and the poor, and the afflicted.  And he planted gardens and\nmade for them storehouses whereto the fruits of the earth might be carried, and those\nplaces, which he made for the poor, and the needy, are called by his name to this day.  His\nbrother was a magistrate of that city and he laid an accusation against him before\nHonorius, Emperor of Rome (A.D. 395-423), and said unto him, “Sawiros (Severianus)\nhath scattered all his possessions and he saith, I give it to Christ, and I shall received a\nreturn therefore from Him as it is promised in the Holy Gospel.”  And these words pleased\nthe emperor, and he rejoiced in Saint Sawiros (Severianus) and loved him exceedingly. \nAnd Honorius the emperor commanded that Sawiros (Severianus) should neither be\nseparated from him nor leave the royal palace, and he used to go with him to church\nalways and stand all night in prayer [with him].   Moreover the righteous Emperor\nHonorius used to practice the works of the monks in secret, and to wear next to his body a\nhair shirt under his royal apparel.  In those days the Archbishop of the city of Rome was\nSaint Yonakendinos, and it was revealed unto him by God that Sawiros (Severianus)\nshould be appointed bishop over many peoples.  And he loved him and he honored him\nexceedingly, and he wished never to be separated from him; everyone loved him, and\nTheodosius (II), Emperor of Constantinople (A.D. 408-450), heard of his fame.  And when\nSawiros (Severianus) saw that everyone honored him, he was afraid that his labor would\nbe wasted, and he wanted to leave that place secretly.  And the angel of the Lord appeared\nunto him and commanded him to go to Debra Gabla and to become the father of the\nmonastery and of many souls.   And having put on the monkish garb he went forth by\nnight, and with him was his disciple Theodore.  And God sent forth a light like unto a\nwheel, which went before him until he came to Debra Gabla.   And there was there a\ncertain righteous man who was the abbot of that monastery, and he learned in a vision\nconcerning the coming of Saint Sawiros (Severianus).   And he went out to him, and\nwelcomed him and embraced him, and told him how a vision concerning him had\nappeared unto him, and he marveled greatly.  And his fame arrived in every region, and all\nthe people came to him, and the number of the men who thronged to him could not be\ncounted.   And the Emperor Theodosius sent forth from him men of position to build\nmonasteries for Saint Sawiros (Severianus).  And the angel of the Lord marked out for\nthem the places wherein they were to build monasteries for him.   And he was the\ncomforter of many souls, and God performed many signs by his hands and wonders\ninnumerable, and among them was the wonder concerning the daughter of the governor of\nGabla, in whom Satan used to dwell.  And Satan said to her father, “If thou wilt drive away\nSawiros (Severianus) from this place I will go out of thy daughter.”  And when the father\nof the girl heard this word, he rose up and went to Saint Sawiros (Severianus), and told\nhim what Satan had said to him and asked him to heal his daughter.  And the holy man\nwrote upon a paper for him these words:  “In the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ get thee\nout of her”; and her father took that paper and carried it to his daughter, and straightway\nSatan went forth from her.   And again there were gathered together many people, the\n\nSamrawiyan and others.  Now they formed a large company, and they wished to come into\nthe monastery of Saint Sawiros (Severianus) and to pillage it.  And God brought darkness\nupon them, and they remained for three days and three nights without seeing anything at\nall; and they made supplication with many tears to Saint Sawiros (Severianus), and he\ndismissed them and they departed.  And when any of those monks who were under his\nauthority fell sick, he prayed over them and healed them, and he comforted them all and\ntaught them the fear of God until they all became like unto the angels of God.  And there\nwas a bishop of that city whose name was Philotheus, and he learned from a vision of God\nthat Saint Sawiros (Severianus) would succeed him as bishop, and he sent letters to all the\npeoples and commanded them to take Saint Sawiros (Severianus) and to appoint him\nbishop, because God had chosen him for this dignity.   Then straightway the righteous\nEmperors Honorius and Arcadius and their governors, took Saint Sawiros (Severianus) and\nappointed him bishop of the city of Gabla, and he fought a great and strenuous fight for the\npreservation of his flock and of the peoples.   And there was in that city a certain Jew\nwhose name was Sektor, and he was very learned and boasted himself of his knowledge of\nthe Law of Moses.  This man came to Saint Sawiros (Severianus) and disputed with him,\nand he would not listen to one word, which came out of the mouth of Saint Sawiros\n(Severianus).  After this God appeared unto the holy man in a vision and informed him\nthat the Jew would become one of the holy and blessed people of Christ.  And when the\nJew went to his house he saw during a sleep the places of severe punishment, and it\nseemed as if one said unto him, “Look upon these unbelieving Jews, thy kinsmen, and\nobserve how they and all those who have not believed in Christ, dwell in severe\npunishment which shall be for ever.”  And on the following day that Jew came to Saint\nSawiros (Severianus) and fell down and did homage at his feet, and asked him to make\nhim a Christian.  And straightway he baptized him with Christian baptism, and his house\nand all the men of his city.  When all the other Jews heard that their chief had become a\nChristian, they believed and were baptized and became Christians, and they became even\nas those who were born in the Christian Faith.  And Saint Sawiros (Severianus) entreated\nsome other men who were called Nimontos, now they were magicians, to enter the\nChristian Faith, but they would not hearken unto him because they were puffed up by their\nmagic.  Now when a man was coming to them they would scatter dust in his face, and he\nwould not be able to see anything.  And Saint Sawiros (Severianus) entreated our Lord\nJesus Christ with tears, to bring those men into the Christian Faith.  And God brought upon\nthose men a severe disease, which did not affect anyone among the Christians, even as He\ndid in the land of Egypt when He brought a plague upon Pharaoh, and his army, and the\nEgyptians in the days of old.  And the magicians perceived their error, and that this disease\nhad come upon them because they had not hearkened to Saint Sawiros (Severianus).  And\nthey rose up and came to the saint and became Christians, and all that city became one\npasture.  And Satan groaned and cried out like an old man who has rent his garments, and\nhe said, “Behold, I am in distress in every part of the world.  Holy monks have filled all\nthe country of Egypt from one end to the other, the Archbishop Yonakendinos dwelleth in\nthe country of Rome, John of the Golden Mouth (Chrysostom) dwelleth in Constantinople,\nand this place only was left unto me, and behold Sawiros (Severianus) hath taken it from\nme.”   And the men of Persia sent a despatch to the Emperors Honorius and Arcadius,\nseeking to be their allies in battle, and these righteous emperors sent the Persian dispatch\nto Saint Sawiros (Severianus).   And when he had read it he wrote a dispatch to the\nEmperors Honorius and Arcadius to instruct them [in his views], and he said unto them,\n“If we belong to Christ, and if our kingdom belongeth to Christ, we have no need of\narmor, or spears, or troops.”  And he began to remind them of the signs which God had\nwrought for the righteous kings of olden time, and how he had made them strong and how\nthey had vanquished their enemies.  And before the great fast came the Persians being\nashamed departed from them.  As concerning John Chrysostom.  Having brought Saint\nSawiros (Severianus) with the bishops, the holy man admonished with great severity the\nEmpress Eudoxia, because of John Chrysostom, for he had done nothing whatsoever\nworthy of banishment.  And when the empress would not hearken unto him, he returned to\nhis city and wrote discourses in which he admonished her severely, and these discourses\nare read in Orthodox churches unto this day.  And Saint Sawiros (Severianus) waxed old,\nand his days were one hundred years.  Before his departure from the body, at the tenth\n\n[hour] of the day the angel of God appeared unto him, and summoned him to go forth from\nthis world and from toil into rest.  And the holy man ordered his people to continue to keep\nthe Law of God; then he died and delivered his soul into the hand of his Creator.  His death\ntook place two years after John Chrysostom died, and one year after Saint Epiphanius,\nBishop of Cyprus, died (A.D. 394).   When Saint Sawiros (Severianus) was dead, they\nprepared his pure body for burial as was meet, and they sang spiritual songs and laudatory\nsentences and buried him in a grave.\nAnd on this day also Agathon, Peter, John, Ammon, and Ammona and their mother Rapika\n(Rebecca) became holy martyrs.   This holy man came from the city of Konya, on the\nborders of the district of Kus in Upper Egypt.  And our Lord Christ appeared unto them\nand informed them what would happen unto them, how they would receive the crown of\nmartyrdom in the city of Sebra which is near the city of Alexandria, and that they would\ntake their bodies to the city of Nikreha to the north of the land of Egypt.  And the holy men\nrejoiced at this vision, and they rose up early in the morning and gave all their possessions\nto the poor.  Now Agathon their eldest brother was a man of high position in his city, and\neveryone loved him, and Rapika (Rebecca) their mother encouraged them and incited\nthem to bear patiently punishment for the Name of Christ.  Then they came to the city of\nKus and confessed Christ before Dionysius the governor, who condemned them to a\nsevere punishment; and he tortured their mother before them, and she bore the torture\nbravely and rejoiced, and then he tortured her five sons.   And when he was weary of\ntorturing them they advised him to send them to the city of Alexandria so that they might\nnot lead astray the people, for they were held in great affection by all, and many men\nthrough them believed in Christ and received a crown of martyrdom.  And when they had\nbrought the holy men to Armenius, the governor of the city of Alexandria, now he was in\nthe city called Sabra, and he learned about their fight, he tortured them very severely.  He\nhacked their bodies with knives, he cast them into a large vessel and kindled a fire on top\nof them, he threw them on to the wheel, and hung them up head downwards.  And in all\nthese tortures our Lord Christ supported them against death until the governor and all his\npeople were ashamed.  Then the governor commanded his men to cut off their heads with\na sword, and to sink their bodies in the sea.  And straightway they cut off their heads with\na sword, and they laid their bodies in a small boat so that they might cast them into the\nsea.  And God sent forthwith an angel to a certain rich man of the city of Nekraha to the\nnorth of Egypt, on the borders of Masil, and commanded him to take the bodies of the\nsaints.  And that rich man went and gave much money to the soldiers, and took the bodies\nof the holy saints, and he heard a voice, which said, “This is the abode of the saints.”  And\nhe laid them in the church until the time of tribulation passed by, and then he revealed their\nexistence; and they built a fine church and laid their bodies therein.   And God made\nmanifest from their bones many great signs and wonders, and recently they translated their\nbodies to the city of Samnutya (Samhud in the province of Farshut).\nAnd on this day also Fasiladas and two thousand [of his companions] were martyred.\nAnd on this day also are to be commemorated Das, Gagra, Nawla, Bishop of Antioch, and\nPeter the monk. \nAnd on this day also is commemorated the birth of Hanna the mother of our Lady.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

When the angel Gabriel announced to this priest the birth of John his son,\nhe did not believe his word.  Because of this Gabriel said, “Thou shalt be dumb until the\nchild is born,” and he was dumb until the child was born; but when he was born, he spoke\nand he glorified God, and he wrote and said, “His name is John.”  And the Holy Gospel\nbeareth testimony concerning him, and shows that he and his wife were righteous, and that\nthey walked in the Law of God without blemish.  When our Lord Christ was born, and the\nmen who were soothsayers came to worship Him, Herod was troubled and feared for his\nkingdom.  For this reason he sent and slew all the children of Bethlehem of Judah whose\ndays were two years and less than two years, and Herod thought that among their number\nhe would kill Christ.  And the angel of God appeared unto Joseph in a dream, and he took\nour Lord and Mary His mother and they came to the land of Egypt.  And the mother of\nJohn took him, and went out into the fields, and fled into the desert of Sina, and she dwelt\nthere bringing up her child for seven years.  Then the mother of the boy died and left her\nchild alone in the desert, and there he stayed until his showing himself to Israel.  When\nHerod killed the children he thought in his heart that John was Christ, and he sent his\nlictors to seek for him with his father Zacharias.  And Zacharias said unto him, “I know\nneither where the boy is nor his mother.”  And Herod said unto him, “If thou dost not bring\nthy son unto me I myself will slay thee”; but Zacharias was not afraid of him.  And Herod\ntold his soldiers to slay Zacharias, and they slew him between the sanctuary and the altar;\nand God hid his body and his blood became like unto stone.  And when the priests and the\npeople were coming to prayer according to their wont, one of the priests arrived and went\ninto the sanctuary, and he found the blood and he heard a voice which cried out in the altar,\nsaying, “Zacharias the son of Berachiah hath been slain”; and his blood continued to cry\nout until it was avenged.  Now this Zacharias, the son of Berachiah, was not one of the\ntwelve sons of the prophets, for that Zacharias was not killed, but died in the country of\nUrati where his body was found in a perfect state and undecayed, and they built a church\nfor it.  As for this holy man Zacharias, [the father of John,] his body was never found, but\nhis blood became a witness of his slaughter.  And it is also said that when Herod slew the\nchildren a certain Jew said unto him, “Behold, a son hath been born unto Zacharias even as\nthe angel of God told him, peradventure he is Christ.”  And Herod sent his lictors to slay\nthe child John.  And Zacharias said unto them, “I have taken the child to a certain place;\ncome ye with me and take him from that place.”  And the lictors went with him until he\nbrought them into the sanctuary.  And he set his son John on the wing of the altar, where\nthe angel of God had announced [his birth], and immediately the angel of God snatched\naway the child, and carried him off to the desert Zifata.  And when the lictors could not\nfind the child they slew Zacharias his father.  Therefore did our Lord say unto the Jews,\n“The blood of Zacharias whom ye slew shall come upon you,” for it was the Jews who\nwere the cause of his slaughter.\nAnd on this day also died Moses the prophet and righteous man, and head of the Prophets. \nThis prophet labored with the people of God, and he suffered tribulation with them until\n[his] death and he delivered up his soul.  This man it was who worked signs and wonders\nin Egypt and in the sea ‘Eritrea (Red Sea), and he was not well pleased to be called the\n“son of Pharaoh’s daughter,” who brought him up, when his parents had cast him into the\nriver of Egypt because of the decree of Pharaoh who commanded that all the male children\nof the Hebrews should be destroyed.  When the daughter of Pharaoh the king found him\nshe took him and reared him as if he had been her own son.  And when he was fully forty\nyears old he saw an Egyptian slay one of the Hebrews, and straightway he avenged the\nHebrew and slew the Egyptian.   On the following day he saw two other men fighting\ntogether, and he attempted to make peace between them.  And he who was in the wrong\n\nrose up and said unto him, “Dost thou wish to slay me as thou didst slay the Egyptian\nyesterday?”  And because of this Moses fled to the land of Midian and there he married a\nwife and begot two sons.  When he was eighty years old there appeared unto him a vision\nand a fire in the Patos tree, and when he came to look and to learn [what it was], God\nspoke unto him from out of the tree, and commanded him to depart to Egypt, and to bring\nout the Children of Israel from there.  Then God worked ten plagues with His own hands\nupon the Egyptians; the first was the river, which became blood, and the last was the\nslaughter of the first born of the Egyptians.  After this He brought the people out of the\nland of Egypt, and He divided the sea ‘Eritrea (Red Sea) and made them to pass through it,\nand He brought back the water of the sea over their enemies, Pharaoh and his host, and\ndrowned them in the sea ‘Eritrea (Red Sea).  And He brought down for them “Manna” in\nthe Arabian Desert forty years, and He made water to flow forth from a rock; all these\nbeautiful things did Moses the prophet perform for them.  And they used to curse him, and\nmany times they wished to stone him, but he was longsuffering with them, and he prayed\nto God for them, and because he loved them greatly he said unto God, “If Thou wilt not\nforgive this people their transgression, then blot out my name from Thy book” (Exodus\nxxxii, 32).   And the Book is a witness concerning him - that he spoke with God five\nhundred [times], and the words testify [that God talked with him] as a man talketh with his\nfriend.  And his face shone with the light of the glory of God, and he was obliged to veil\nhis face so that the children of Israel might not die when they looked upon it.  When he\nwas fully one hundred and twenty years old God commanded him to deliver the people\nover into the hand of Joshua, the son of Nun, his disciple, that he might shepherd them. \nAnd he called Joshua and commanded him with the command of God and the Law, and he\ndelivered the people into his hand, and informed him that he was to bring the people into\nthe land of [their] inheritance.  And after Moses had made the Tabernacle of Witness and\neverything which was in it by the command of God, he died in the mountain and was\nburied there, and God hid his body so that the children of Israel should not take it and\nworship it.  And the Book testifieth among the children of Israel there never rose up a\nprophet who was like unto Moses.  When Satan wished to uncover (or reveal) the body of\nMoses, Michael the archangel rebuked him, and prevented him from doing so, even as\nJude the apostle testifieth in the book of the apostle (verse 9).  And the children of Israel\nmourned for Moses three days.\nAnd on this day also Dimasyos (Dimasius) became a martyr.  This holy man was from the\ncity of Derseba on the borders of Dantu to the north of the land of Egypt, he loved the\nChurch, and the poor, and he visited the sick.  And a man who was shining with light\nappeared unto him and commanded him to go and receive the crown of martyrdom, and he\nmade covenants with heaven and rejoiced greatly.  And he forsook his father and went\nforth from his city, and he prayed to God to give him help during the torture for His holy\nName’s sake.   And he came into the city of Athribis and confessed Christ before the\ngovernor, who tortured him severely and sent him to Lucianus the governor of the city of\nAlexandria.   And whilst he was in the boat, our Lord Christ appeared unto him, and\ncomforted him, and encouraged him, and promised him everlasting happiness; and his soul\nrejoiced and was exceedingly glad.  And Lucianus tortured him very severely and then cut\noff his head with a sword; thus Dimasius received the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom\nof heaven.  And the people of his city came and took away his body, and paid great honors\nto it, and through it signs and mighty wonders took place.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated:  Lucianus the martyr, ‘Ermeyas (Jeremiah), and\nthe nobles ‘Andewa and ‘Elyanos, and ‘Ammon the monk.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and she loved our Lady Mary exceedingly, and\nministered unto her with all her power.  One day there lodged with her a certain righteous\nmonk whose name was Theodore, and she received him with joy.  And on the following\nday when she was bidding him farewell, she said unto him, “Whither goest thou, O\nfather?”  And he said unto her, “I go to worship in the Sanctuary in Jerusalem.”  And she\nsaid unto him, “Take a little money from me to buy me a picture of our Lady Mary, and\nbring it to me when thou returnest to me”; and he said unto her, “I will buy [a picture] with\nmy own money, and bring it to thee.”  And when he had arrived in Jerusalem he knelt and\nprayed in the holy places, and he set out on his return journey without having bought the\npicture.   And immediately he heard a voice, which said unto him, “Why hast thou\nforgotten to buy the picture?”  And being troubled by the voice he turned back into the\nmarketplace, and found a picture of our Lady Mary, which had sweet features and a\nbeautiful form.  Having bought it he wrapped it up in cotton and in fine linen.  And as he\nwas traveling along a terrible road in the desert thieves rose up against him, and when he\nwas wishing to take to flight, a voice came forth from that picture which said, “Fear not: \ncomplete thy journey”; and he went on his way and none challenged him.  Another time a\nsavage lion rose up against him and wanted to rend him, and straightway an awful voice\ncame forth from that picture and drove away the lion.  And when Theodore saw all these\nsigns and wonders, he wanted to carry that picture and drove away the lion.  And when\nTheodore saw all these signs and wonders, he wanted to carry that picture to his own city,\nand he did not wish to give it to the widow.  And as he was traveling by boat on another\njourney, the wind rose up against him and carried him towards Damascus.  And having\ndisembarked he went into the house of that widow with several other pilgrims, and he did\nnot discover himself to her, and she did not know him.  And on the following day when he\nwished to go forth secretly and to depart to his city, the gates of the house failed to work\nand they remained jammed throughout the day; in the evening the monk returned to his\nabode, and when the widow saw him she wondered.  And he continued to do this for three\ndays, returning each evening; he saw the gate, but when he wished to go through it, he was\nunable to go on his way.  Then the widow took him and said unto him, “O my father, what\naileth thee?  Is thine heart troubled that I see thee thus disturbed?”  And then he told her\neverything that had come upon him in the matter of the picture.   And straightway she\nbrought him into her house, and she opened the wrappings of the picture and found that\ndrops of sweat were falling from it; and by reason of her joy she kissed the hands and feet\nof the monk.  Then she took the picture into her prayer-chamber, and laid it upon a stand in\na recess with great honors.  And she made for it a brass grating, so that no one could touch\nit, and she hung before it lamps which burned by day and by night, and outside these she\nhung silken curtains.  Beneath the picture she set a marble bowl into which the drops of\noil, which sweated out from it, might be collected.  And that monk dwelt with the widow,\nand ministered to the picture of our Lady Mary until they both died.   And when the\narchbishop of that city heard the report of the picture, he, and the bishops and the priests\nand all the people came [to the house], and when they looked at the tablet with the picture\nthey found that it was in the condition of being covered with flesh; and they marveled at\nthis divine work.  And having emptied out the oil from the bowl, and divided it among\nthemselves as a blessed thing, the bowl filled up [again] immediately.   When they\nattempted to remove the picture to another spot a great earthquake took place, and many\npeople died; and the picture remaineth there until this day.\n\nAnd on this day died Judith the prophetess, who delivered Israel from the hand of\nHolophernes, the evil one, through the wisdom and counsel which she employed until at\nlength she cut off his head by the might of God which was upon her.\nAnd on this day also the birth of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, took place according to\nwhat is written in the Book of Exposition of Saint Abba Macarius of Debra Skete (the\nmonastery of Scete).  And it is also written in the Holy Scriptures.  On the thirteenth day of\nthe month Tahsas (Dec. 7), the righteous woman Hanna, the mother of our holy Lady, the\nVirgin Mary, conceived, and her bringing forth took place on the first day of Maskaram\n(Sept. 8--Oct. 7).  And it is found in other books that on the seventh day of the month of\nNehase (August), God sent the angel Gabriel to the righteous Joachim and told him,\nsaying, “Thy wife Hanna shall be with child.”  And immediately she had union with her\nhusband Joachim she conceived, and she brought forth on the first day of the month\nGenbot (May 9 - June 7).  And it is meet that we should commemorate the festival of the\nbirth of our holy Lady the Virgin Mary on both of them, because she maketh intercession\nfor us to her beloved Son at all times, and behold, we will write the commemoration of her\nbirth on the first day of the month Genbot.  May her intercession be with us.  Amen.\nAnd on this day also the Matronya became a martyr.  This holy woman was handmaiden to\na Jewish woman,  and she was a Christian even as her parents were Christians.  And that\nJewish woman her mistress hated [Christianity], and she wished to make her maid\nabandon the Christian Religion, and to bring her over to the Jewish Faith, which she would\nnot embrace.  For this reason she reviled Matronya and made her service heavy upon her. \nOne day Matronya followed her mistress the Jewish lady until she brought her to the\nJewish synagogue, and Matronya turned aside and went into the holy church.  And when\nher mistress asked her, saying, “Why didst thou not come into my synagogue?”  The holy\nMatronya answered and said unto her, “God is very remote from thy synagogue, and how\nwould it be seemly for me to enter therein?  But the place which is seemly for me to enter\nis the holy church, which our Lord Jesus Christ purchased with his precious blood.”  When\nhe mistress heard these words she was wroth with her and beat her severely, and shut her\nup in a dark place wherein she remained for four days without food and drink; then the\nJewess had her brought out from her prison and beat her cruelly with many, many stripes,\nand once again she sent her back into the prison, where she died.  And after her death her\nmistress took her body, and carried it up to the roof of her house, and according to what\nthe men say who saw her, she cast it out, and it fell down by itself.  Now the mistress of\nMatronya was afraid of the Government, and alarmed lest they should examine her about\nher murder.  And the wrath of God fell upon that Jewish woman, and as she was coming\ndown from the roof of her house, she fell down headlong, and died, and departed into fire\nforever.  And this holy woman Matronya went to joy everlasting.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Saint Athanasia and her three children.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and he had many slaves and handmaidens.  There\nwas a certain prince in Rom in those days whose name was Numerianus [son of the\nEmperor Carus], and he married a sister of Saint Fasiladas (Basilides), a lady of high rank,\nthe mother of Theodore Banadelewos.  And by him she became the mother of Justus, and\nClaudius, and ‘Abadir.  These were the sons of the sister of Saint Fasiladas (Basilides),\nwho was the sister of the mother of Victor.  And Fasiladas (Basilides) begot by her two\nsons, one whose name was ‘Awsabyos (Eusebius) and the other was [called] Macarius. \nAnd at that time the men of Kuez and Persia were at war with Rom [about A.D. 283], and\nthey sent Justus, the son of the king, and ‘Awsabyos (Eusebius), the son of Fasiladas\n(Basilides), with their armies, and they went to the war.  And Numerianus the prince went\nto fight against the other [enemies], who slew that king in that war.  Thus the kingdom of\nRom was without a king to rule it and to administer the affairs thereof.  At that time the\nmen of Rom gathered together large numbers of mighty men of war from every city into\ntheir army.  And among them was a certain man whose name was ‘Agripada, and who was\na native of Upper Egypt, and a goat-herd.  And the Government took him and set him over\nthe royal horses, and he was bold in character and a mighty man in action.  And one of the\ndaughters of prince Numerianus saw him from a window of the royal palace, and she\nloved him and lusted for that ‘Agripada, and she took him and married him, and made him\nking, and called him “Diocletian.”  And after a few days he forsook the Lord God, the God\nof heaven, and worshipped idols.  And when Fasiladas (Basilides) heard this thing, he was\nvery sorry, and he did not return to reign in his kingdom.   And Justus, the son of\nNumerianus, and ‘Awsabyos (Eusebius), the son of Fasiladas (Basilides), returned from\nthe war with great joy, for they had slain all their enemies, and had lain waste their\ncountries.  When they arrived in the city of Antioch and found that Diocletian, the denier\nof Christ, and the worshipper of idols was king, they were exceedingly sorry.  And they\ndrew their swords and wished to slay Diocletian the king, and to appoint king Justus, the\nson of Numerianus, but Fasiladas (Basilides) kept them from this act.   After this Saint\nFasiladas (Basilides) gathered together all his kinsfolk, and his soldiers, and his slaves, and\ninformed them that he wished to pour out his blood for the sake of Christ’s Name; and\nthey all said unto him, “The death which thou diest we also will die with thee.”  And they\nall agreed together and stood before King Diocletian, who feared them with a very great\nfear, for they belonged to the kingdom (i.e. the royal family).  And Herminius the father of\nVictor advised him to banish them to the country of Egypt, and to punish them there.  And\nhe sent them all away, each to a different city, namely ‘Abadir, and ‘Ira’I, the sister of\n‘Awsabyos (Eusebius), and Macarius, the brother of Claudius, and Victor.   Theodore\nBanadelewos he hung upon a komol tree, and drove one hundred and fifty-three nails\nthrough his body, and thus Theodore consummated his martyrdom.  Fasiladas (Basilides)\nhe sent to a city of ‘Afrakya, of Five Cities (Pentopolis) to Masrus the governor; and when\nMasrus saw him he marveled exceedingly why he had left his kingdom and his glory.  And\nour Lord Christ sent His angel and lifted him up by the spirit into heaven and showed him\nthe spiritual habitation; and his soul rejoiced exceedingly.  Of his slaves, some he set free,\nand some received the crown of martyrdom with him; now the number of the latter was\n7033.   And [Diocletian] tortured the holy man on the rack, and they cut his body into\npieces with sharpened rods of iron, and he died; but our Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom be\nglory, raised him up from the dead whole and uninjured.  And when all the people who\ndwelt there saw this, they marveled exceedingly, and they believed in our Lord Jesus\nChrist, to whom be glory, and they cursed the governor.  And the governor was wroth with\nthem, and he commanded his soldiers to cut off their heads, and they cut off their heads\nwith the sword, and they received crowns of martyrdom in the kingdom of heaven; and the\n\nnumber of these was 5700 men and 37 women.  Then they threw Fasiladas (Basilides) into\na frying pan and roasted him, and he became like water, and his whole body was melted. \nAnd the governor commanded them to dig a deep pit on the mountaintop, and to bury him\ntherein, and they did so; and straightway our Lord Christ, to Whom be glory, raised him up\nfrom the dead a second time.   And Fasiladas (Basilides) came once again before the\ngovernor, and he cried out and said, “Be ashamed, O governor Masrus, thou infidel king,\nand let thy idols be ashamed with thee!  For behold, my Lord Jesus Christ hath raised me\nup from the dead, whole and uninjured.”  And when the people who were there saw this\nmiracle, they believed on our Lord Jesus Christ and became martyrs, and they were in\nnumber 2300.  Then the king made Saint Fasiladas (Basilides) to go up upon a machine\nwith wheels and a saw inside it, and he inflicted severe tortures upon him, and then he\nmade him to lie on his liver upon an iron bed, and had a fire lighted under him.  And\nstraightway our Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom be glory, appeared unto him, and raised him\nup from the torture, and made him whole and uninjured.  He made him a promise, and said\nunto him, “O my chosen one Fasiladas (Basilides), know thou that everyone who shall\ncelebrate thy commemoration, or shall give alms to the poor for thy name’s sake, or shall\ngive clothing to the naked, or shall give incense to the church for thy commemoration, and\neveryone who shall celebrate thy commemoration, whether in little or whether in much, to\nall these will I give remission of sins, and I will make their habitation to be with Me in the\nkingdom of heaven.”  And having said this unto him, our Lord went up into heaven in\ngreat glory.  When Saint Fasiladas (Basilides) heard this from our Lord he rejoiced with\ngreat joy.  Then Masrus the governor took counsel with his advisers, and said unto them,\n“What shall I do about this man whose name is Fasiladas (Basilides)?  I have no other\ntorture left which I can apply to him, and he will not turn from his opinion.”  And they\ncounseled him and said unto him, “Cut off his head with the sword, and be quit of him, for\nbehold, all the men of the city were being corrupted through him.”  And straightway the\ngovernor commanded his men to cut off the head of Saint Fasiladas (Basilides), and they\ncut off his head, and he received a crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of heaven in the\nplace of the earthly kingdom, which he had cast aside and forsaken.  And signs and great\nwonders were made manifest through his body.  Now the number of all those who became\nmartyrs with him was 5793. May their blessing and prayer be with us.  Amen.\nAnd on this day also the holy woman Banafzez [literally “violet”], the interpretation\nwhereof is, “Whose odor is sweet,” became a martyr.  This holy woman was old and very\nfar advanced in years, and she fought her fight in the days of Sabor, King of Persia; they\ncarried her away bound into captivity together with nine thousand Christians whom they\nhad captured.  The general of the army first tortured her very severely and then cut off her\nhead, the blood, which flowed from her neck, spurted out a very long way.   And the\nstrength of [her] enemies, that is to say the soldiers who dwelt there, drooped, and the light\nof the sun was turned to darkness, and the odor of a very sweet smell filled the place.\nAnd on this day also three husbandmen of the city of ‘Asni [in Upper Egypt], whose\nnames were Sures and ‘Ankityos and Mashadra, were martyred.   When Arianus was\nreturning towards the north he slew all the people everywhere and spared no one, and at\nlength his soldiers were exhausted and they put back their swords into their sheaths.  And\nthese three holy husbandmen met him on the bridge (ferry) on their way back from the\nfield, and they cried out and said unto him boldly, “We are Christians.”  And when Arianus\nheard them, he said unto his officers, “Hear ye these men?  Do ye wish to kill them?”  And\nhis soldiers said unto him, “We are weary, and we have put back our swords into their\nsheaths.”  And when the holy men heard them they said unto him, “Behold, here are our\ndigging tools, kill us with them.”  Then they laid their heads down on a stone, and the\nsoldiers hacked through their necks.\nAnd on this day also is the commemoration of the blessed Cornelius, a general and\nrighteous man.  He lived in the days of the holy Apostles, and he fought the good fight\nstrenuously, and was well pleasing unto God.   And an angel appeared unto him and\ncommanded him to send men to invite Peter the apostle to come to him, so that he might\nhear from him what was right.  And when Peter the apostle came to him he told him, and\nall those who were with him, the word of our Lord Jesus Christ; and Cornelius believed,\n\nand he and all his house were baptized; and Peter the apostle appointed him to the Church\nof Alexandria.  And when he arrived there he found [the city] filled with the worship of\nidols, and he baptized many of the men thereof and baptized them with Christian baptism. \nAnd Demetrius the governor believed, and Cornelius baptized him and all the people of\nhis house with Christian baptism.   And he passed his whole life in fighting like the\nApostles, and he was the first of the Gentiles who believed [on Christ].\nAnd on this day also died Saint Theodora.  This holy woman was a native of Alexandria,\nand she lived in the days of Zeno the emperor; a strange man forced her, and also took her\nhandmaiden and defiled her.  And straightway she sorrowed with a bitter sorrow, and wept\nbitter tears.  And she put on male attire secretly, and went forth from the city of Alexandria\nin the guise of a man, and she called herself Theodore.  Then she went to a monastery of\nmonks, and arrayed herself in the garb of the monks, which is the garb of angels, and all\nthose who saw her thought that she was a eunuch.  And she devoted herself to the ascetic\nlife, and fought a most strenuous fight, and she endured thirst, and hunger, and the\nweariness of night vigil, and the standing up by day; and she continued to lead this life for\nmany years.  Now a certain man committed fornication with a certain woman, and she\nconceived by him and brought forth a child; and her parents said unto her, “Who is it that\nhath defiled thy virginity?”  And she uttered a lie against this holy woman Theodora, and\nsaid, “It is Theodore the monk who liveth in the monastery that hath defiled me, and I am\nwith child by him.”  And when her parents heard these words they were exceedingly sorry,\nand they took the child and carried him to the abbot of the monastery, and said unto him,\n“Take this child, for he is the son of Theodore the monk, thy son.”   And the abbot\nsummoned this holy woman, and said unto him (sic), “Why hast thou done this\nabominable thing, and brought shame and disgrace upon the whole community of\nmonks?”  Now he did not know that it was a woman to whom he spoke.  And the holy\nwoman Theodora said unto him, “I have sinned.  Have mercy upon me, O my father.”  And\nstraightway the abbot was wroth, and he gave her the child, and expelled her from the\nmonastery; and she dwelt in the desert seven years, and the child was with her.  And she\nendured many trials and tribulations caused by devils, and Satan tortured her cruelly.  After\nthis she was received, and one brought her into the monastery again, where she lingered a\nfew days and then died, and delivered her soul into the hand of God.  And she received life\neverlasting with all the saints, and she finished a good fight.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Saint Basil the martyr, Theodore, Bishop of\nJerusalem, Kawestos, the chief of the martyrs of the city of Alexandria, and those who\nwere martyred with him.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

He Who shall be born of thee is holy and shall be called the son\nof the Most High.”  And they brought before him also the words of Isaiah (vii, 14) the\nprophet in his prophecy, “Behold a virgin shall conceive, and she shall bear a son, and his\nname shall be called Emmanuel.”  And again he saith, “There shall go forth from Jesse a\nroot, and he who shall arise from it shall be the hope of the Gentiles” (Isaiah xi, 1, 10). \nAnd moreover, our father Saint Cyril, Archbishop of the city of Alexandria, rebuked him,\nand admonished him, and said unto him, “Natures cannot be separated after they have\nbecome one in their unity, on the contrary, and we believe and declare that the Word of\nGod that became man is One Nature only.”   And Nestorius the unbeliever would not\nbelieve this, and he would not turn from his unbelief, and the whole General Council\nrebuked him and threatened him that they would cut him off from his priesthood and office\nunless he turned from his evil counsel.  And he would neither hearken now accept the\nwords of the whole Council, and they therefore cut him off from his priesthood, and they\nanathematized him, and excommunicated him, and drove him forth from the Council into\nUpper Egypt, where he died an evil death and departed into Sheol for ever.  And these\nfathers, the two hundred bishops, confirmed the belief and made known in writing the\ndeclaration of this Council, and they said, “Our Lady Mary, the holy Virgin, the God-\nbearer, brought forth the Word of God made flesh.”  And they drew up the Canon and laid\ndown the Law, and they signed it with their own hands, and gave it to the faithful unto this\nday.   And if it be said that in these days the Nestorians do not believe in the faith of\nNestorius, the unbeliever, we reply that this is due to the fact that the Nestorians have\nmingled with the Jacobites who are in Syria, and in the country of the East generally, and\nthat some of them have turned from their evil counsel.  And we will beseech God to guide\nus in the way of salvation - to Whom be praise and glory forever and ever!  Amen.\nSalutation to ‘Aflahos the martyr, and to those who were martyred with him.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated the translation of the bodies of Saint ‘Aflahos the\nmartyr and his companions in the city of Alexandria.\n\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Luras (Luyuras) and Galanicus (Calanicus) the\nmartyrs, and Joachim and Hanna, and on it a festival is held in Rome in honor of Stephen\n(protomartyr).\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and the maiden\nwept, and repented and was exceedingly sorry.  And when the young man knew that his\nmatter was revealed unto her plainly, he said unto her, “I have not done any evil\nwhatsoever.”  And she answered and said unto him, “If thou art a Christian, and if what\nthou sayest is true, come with me and we will go and enter the church together, and we\nwill received the Holy Mysteries.”  And having forced him he told her of all that he had\ndone for her sake, and how he had gone to that magician and written that paper for him\nwith his own hand, and how he had denied Christ and believed on Satan, and had written\nthat paper for him with his own hand, and had given it to Satan.  When the maiden heard\nthis thing from him she was exceedingly sorry and rebuked herself.  And straightway she\nrose up and made haste to go to that pillar and light of the church, Saint Basil, bishop of\nher city, and she told him what had happened unto her, and she wept and did homage at his\nfeet, and entreated him to deliver and save her.  And Saint Basil sent and had the young\nman brought to him, and he learned from him his affair, and the young man revealed unto\nhim what he had done.  Then Saint Basil asked him, saying, “Dost thou wish to return and\nto be a Christian once more?”  And the young man answered and said unto him with tears,\n“Is it possible for this to happen unto me, my lord?”  And the saint said unto him, “Be of\ngood cheer, and fear not,” and he made the sign of the Cross over him, and he shut him up\n\nin a chamber near him, and commanded him to pray until the third day; and Basil went and\nprayed for him.  And after the third day Basil visited him, and he said unto him, “What\nhath happened unto thee during the past three days?”  And the young man made known\nunto him that he had been in very great tribulation, which was caused by the cries of\nSatans, who showed him the paper, which he had written and were very wroth with him. \nAnd Saint Basil said unto him, “Be not afraid of them, for God will help thee, and\nstrengthen thee, and preserve thee.”  And Saint Basil gave him bread and water, and took\nhim back into the place of his confinement, and prayed over him again.  Later he visited\nhim again, and he said unto him, “What hath happened unto thee?”  And the young man\nsaid, “I hear their cry, but I see them not.”  And again Saint Basil gave him bread and\nwater, and admonished him and rebuked him, and said unto him, “Be not afraid”; then\nBasil took him back again into his place of confinement, and went away and prayed for\nhim.  Now Saint Basil shut him up in this way for three days at a time, and visited him\nevery third day for forty days.  And when the saint visited him at the completion of the\nforty days he asked the young man what had happened to him.  And the young man said\nunto him, “O my holy father, last night I saw thee waging war against Satan on my behalf,\nand thou didst vanquish him straightway”; and when Saint Basil heard these words from\nhim he rejoiced exceedingly.  And he summoned all the monks from the monasteries, and\nthe priests, and they prayed for that young man all that night.  On the following day he\nbrought the young man to the church, and the people of that city came there also, and Saint\nBasil commanded them all to lift up their hands to heaven, and to pray and to make\nentreaty to God and say, “Have mercy upon us”; and they did as he commanded them. \nAnd they continued to cry out and to say, “Lord have mercy upon us,” until that writing\nwhich the young man had written with his own hand for Satan fell down; and it fell down\nin the presence of all the people.  And Saint Basil unrolled the paper and read it before all\nthe people, and he blessed the young man and gave him the Holy Mysteries.  And he took\nthe woman and blessed them together, and they departed to their house rejoicing and\nexulting in their salvation, and in the remission of their sins.  And they praised God and\nascribed thanks to Saint Basil who by his prayer had saved them from the error of Satan.\nAnd on this day also Abba Isaac the anchorite became a martyr.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and he slept on the ground without a\nmattress, and at length the skin of his body clave to his bones.  And he read continually the\nhistory of the striving of Abba Simon of the pillar (Simon Stylites), and he was always\nenvious of his striving.  And he meditated in his heart, shutting himself up, and he took\ncounsel with the holy fathers concerning it, and they said this counsel is good; and he was\nblessed by them and they prayed over him.  And he went out of the desert, and came nigh\nunto the world, to the city of Saka (i.e. Sakha, in the province of Gharbiyah), and he dwelt\nin a little church.  And the believers built him a pillar there, and he went up on it and stood\non it, and labored strenuously in the ascetic life for a space of fifty years.  In his days there\nappeared a man in whom was a filthy Satan and who led many people astray.  And that\nman dwelt in a church, and the people used to throng about him to hear his doctrine, and\nwith them they carried branches of trees.  And Abba Agathon sent and had him brought to\nhim, and he prayed over him, and drove out from him the devil who used to address the\npeople through him.  Similarly, a certain woman used to say, “Minas the martyr holdeth\nconverse with me.”  And she commanded her followers, and they dug a pool of water in\nthe name of Abba Minas the martyr, and [pretended that] all those who bathed therein\nwere healed.  And Saint Abba Agathon prayed over that woman until he cast out from her\nthat unclean spirit.  And Saint Abba Agathon commanded the men of that city to fill up\nthat pool.  And there was also another man who used to raise up those who were mad and\nwho were possessed of the devil, and when he beat them the devil used to leave them for a\nshort time; and very many of those who were possessed of devils gathered together to\nhim.  And Saint Abba Agathon sent messages to him very often bidding him to come to\nhim, and he would not obey him and neither came to him nor forsook his error.  And when\nthe governor of that city passed by, those who were possessed of devils cursed him, and\nfor this reason the governor took that man, and punished him with exceedingly great\nseverity, and he died straightway during his punishment.  And another man, a priest, fell\ninto fornication with a woman in the church, and polluted (or destroyed) his portion of it;\nand the people took him and brought him to Saint Abba Agathon, and he prayed over him\nand God healed him.  And the holy man commanded that priest to take good heed that he\ndid not minister in the priesthood during all the remaining days of his life.  And the holy\nman Agathon worked many miracles, and he healed very many sick people.  And there\nappeared unto him in the forms of angels very many Satans who sang unto him very sweet\nsongs, and ascribed blessing to him, but by the might of Christ, to Whom be praise, he\nknew their guile, and he made over them the sign of the Glorious Cross, and they fled\n\nfrom before him speedily.  And when God wished to make him to rest from the toil of this\nworld, Agathon fell sick of a slight illness, and he delivered up his soul into the hand of\nGod.  Now very many people used to gather together to him, and he would teach them the\nway of God and would heal them of their sicknesses through his prayers.   When they\nfound out that he was dead they wept bitterly because they had lost their father who was\nwont to comfort them, and because they were the orphans of this glorious father.  Now all\nthe days of the life of this holy man Abba Agathon were one hundred years.  He dwelt in\nthe world forty years, and in the desert ten years, and he toiled in ascetic labors and lived\nupon a pillar for fifty years.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Makari (Macarius) the martyr, and Bartholomew,\nand ‘Awedra, and Nasen (Naso), and Degana the priest.\nAnd on this day also died Abba Degana the priest.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

And they built a beautiful church, and they laid therein a gem, a\n\npearl of great price, a holy thing, that is to say the body of that holy and blessed man\nStephen the apostle, the archdeacon and protomartyr.\nAnd on this day is commemorated the righteous father, Abba Peter of the town of Taraw\n(Daraw in Upper Egypt?).   This holy man was blessed before God from his mother’s\nwomb.   When he grew up to man’s estate he was perfect in heart, and he labored\nstrenuously in ascetic works, and he served God with fasting and prayer day and night\ncontinually.  He never ate the food, which is usually eaten by men, but he lived upon the\nsmall quantity of grass, which he found in the desert, and because of his lack of human\nfood he resembled the angels in his strife.  Moreover, his food was the repetition of the\nName of our Lord Jesus Christ by night and by day ceaselessly.  And it was meet for him\nto walk on his feet into the stream which is called ‘Alon without wetting them, for his\nbody had become exceedingly dry (or hard) through the great tribulation caused by the\nheaviness of the iron which he wore on his body all the days of his life; for he was like\nunto a beast and not a man.  And he pleased God with this manner of striving, and God\nhealed him.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and he gave her much money and apparel made of costly\nsilks threaded with gold.   When she arrived in the city of Jerusalem, and had knelt in\nprayer in certain of the holy places, she made enquiries about the Wood of the honorable\nand Life-giving Cross.   And with much toil and tribulation she found the Wood of the\nCross, and she praised it with great praises, and she paid unto it very great reverence and\nhonor.  Then she commanded her men to build the altar of the sanctuary, and [shrines at]\nGolgotha, and Bethlehem, and the cave wherein our Lord Jesus Christ was born, and the\nfortress of Zion, and Gethsemane wherein was buried the body of our Lady the holy Virgin\nMary, and the Mount of Olives, and all the holy places; and she commanded [the builders]\nto decorate them with pearl, and with gold, and with silver.  Now there was in Jerusalem a\ncertain bishop whose name was Abba Macarius, and he gave her counsel, saying, “Do not\nthus, for after a few days [foreign] peoples will come and will rule over this country, and\nthey will take possession of this place, and will lay it waste, and will seize whatsoever is\nmade of gold and silver and precious stones.  But it is meet that you should build a good,\nstrong building which can neither be overthrown nor torn up from the foundations.  And\nthe remainder of this money give unto the poor and the needy.”  And the Empress “Eleni\n(Helena) accepted his words and delivered much money into his hand, and she\ncommanded all the nobles to build [a building of this kind], and to obey Abba Macarius\nthe bishop in everything which he ordered them to do in the matter of the building.  When\nthe Empress ‘Eleni (Helena) returned to her son Constantine and told him what she had\ndone in Jerusalem, he rejoiced exceedingly, and he sent a further large sum of money, and\noverseers were appointed over the building.  And the emperor commanded them to pay the\nworkmen and all those who served in the work of building their wages daily at eventide\nwithout fail, for the emperor feared lest they should suffer and lest they should complain if\ntheir wages were not paid to them, and lest God should be angry with him because of their\ncomplaint.  And when the building of the holy places was finished in the third year of the\nreign of the righteous Emperor Constantine he sent holy vessels and apparel made of silk\nand gold which was exceedingly costly.  And he sent messages to the Archbishop of the\ncity of Constantinople to take his bishops, and to Athanasius, the Archbishop of the city of\nAlexandria, to take the bishops of his diocese, and also to the Archbishop of the city of\nAntioch, and he commanded them all to gather together in the city of Jerusalem and to\nconsecrate the sanctuary and all the altars of the places which had been built [by ‘Eleni\n(Helena)].  And they all assembled in the city of Jerusalem, and they tarried there until the\nseventeenth day of the month Meskerem, by which day they had consecrated the sanctuary\nand all the altars of the places (i.e. shrines), which had been built.  On that day there was\njoy, the like of which had never before existed.  They performed the appointed service, and\nthey consecrated the Holy Offerings, and they partook of the Holy Mysteries, and a great\nlight appeared, and many signs [were wrought] on that day, the sixteenth of Meskerem. \nAnd they marched round into all the holy places with the Honorable Cross, and they\nworshipped God therein, and they received the Holy Mysteries, and they adored the\nHonorable Cross and sang litanies thereto, and [then] they departed to their countries in\npeace.\n\nAnd on this day also died Obit, the son of Gabael of the seed of ‘Asael, of the tribe of\nNaphtali, who was carried off into captivity in the days of ‘Anemesor, the King of Persia\n(sic), he was a native of Tabes, on the right hand of Kades, which is Naphtali in Galilee,\nwhich is above ‘Aser.  Tobit walked the path of righteousness and integrity all the days of\nhis life.  And the alms were many which he made to his brethren, and to his kinsfolk who\nwent to the country of Persia, and all the people who had apostatized and who offered\nsacrifice to Baal and the Calf.  And Tobit went frequently to Jerusalem, and he took the\nwool of his flock with him, and the tenth of his crop, and he gave one-third to the poor. \nWhen all his brethren were taken captives to Nineveh they ate with the Gentiles, but he\nrestrained himself from eating because he remembered God with all his heart.  One day he\nfound the dead body of a man in the market place, and he rose up although fasting and\nbrought it into a house until the sunset, and when the sun had set he dug a hole in the\nground and buried him.  That night he lay down to sleep against the wall of his garden, and\nhe did not know that there were birds [nesting] in the wall.  And when he uncovered his\nface these birds voided warm dung into his eyes, and a smoke went forth through his eyes\nand there was no man who could give him relief.   And Tobit entreated God, saying,\n“Remember me, O Lord, and look upon my miserable estate, and remember not my sins\nnor the sins of my fathers, for Thou hast made us to be led away into captivity and to be\nscattered.  And now, even according as it pleaseth Thee deal with me before Thee, and\ncommand that my earth may return so that I may dissolve and become dust; for it is better\nfor me to die than to live.”   And on that day the evil spirit Asmodeus found Sara, the\ndaughter of Raguel, for he had married her to seven men, and when these men approached\nher he slew them.  At length the handmaidens of her father reviled and abused her, and she\ncontinued to weep and pray to God that He would save her from their abuse; and her\nprayer and the prayer of Tobit were heard before the Majesty, praise [be unto Him], and\nRafael [was sent to heal them both].   And Tobit remembered the silver, which he had\ncommitted to the care of Gabael, and he called his son Tobias, and he said unto him, “Seek\nout for thyself a hireling who shall go with thee to Gabael that he may bring back the\nmoney which I committed to his care before I die.”  And Tobias found Rafael, who was in\nthe form of a hired servant, and he went with Tobias, who named him “Azarias.”  And they\njourneyed along the road, and they arrived in the evening at the Tigris, and Tobias went\ndown to the river to wash, and a fish leaped out upon him.  And Rafael said unto Tobias,\n“Seize him, and take out his heart, and his liver, and his gall”; and Tobias did as Rafael had\ncommanded him.  And when they arrived in the house of Raguel, Sara received them, and\nTobias desired her, and he spoke unto her father so that he might give her to him; and\nRaguel said unto him, “I have married her to seven men, and all of them have died”; and\nTobias said, “The Lord’s will be done.”  And when they brought Tobias and Sara into the\nmarriage-chamber, Tobias remembered the words of Rafael, and he burned away in smoke\nthe heart and the gall of the fish, and the devil fled from Sara.  And he returned with her to\nthe house of his father, and when Tobit had received him Tobias smeared his father’s eyes\nwith the gall of the fish.  And when Tobit rubbed his eyes and there removed itself from\nhis eyes as it were smoke, and he saw his son, he rejoiced and he prophesied concerning\nthe sufferings of Christ, saying, “Blessed be all those who sorrow for Thy suffering, for\nthey shall rejoice in Thee when they see all Thy glory.”  And again he said, “The walls of\nthe Jerusalem which is in the heavens shall be built of sapphire, and emerald, and precious\nstones, and its tower and its gates shall be of pure gold.  And the court thereof shall be\nmade of beryl and carbuncle and sapphire, and all its paths shall say ‘Hallelujah.’”  And he\nalso prophesied that the Israelites who were captives in Babylon should return, and should\nbuild Jerusalem with glorious mason’s work.  And Tobit commanded his son Tobias to\ndepart from Nineveh, for he knew that the spoliation thereof which Jonah the prophet had\nprophesied would take place.  And he said unto his son, “See my son that thine alms do\nsave thee and justify thee”; and with these words his soul went forth into its rest in the one\nhundred and fifty-eighth year of his age; and Tobias buried him with honor.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Warkela, and Simeon, and Markenos (Marcianus)\n[and ‘Azyanos, and Hali, and Ronikos], and Lucianus, and ‘Azremanos, and Peter, and\nHannah, and Abba Agathon who stopped his mouth with a stone.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

festival of the Honorable Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, to\nWhom be praise, for this is the day on which the holy woman, the Empress Helena,\nbeloved of God, mother of the righteous Emperor Constantine, revealed the Cross, for\nhaving cleared away the hill of Golgotha she found [there] the Honorable Cross.  And why\ndid this great hill come into being?  It was because of the many signs and wonders, which\nwere made manifest at the holy tomb of our Lord Jesus Christ; for the dead were raised,\nand the paralytics were healed, and the sick were made whole.   And because of these\nthings the Jews were furiously angry, and they sent forth a decree throughout all the\ncountry of Judea and Jerusalem ordering that every man should cast the sweepings of his\nhouse, and the ashes, and offal of every kind on the grave of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And\nthe Jews did this for more than two hundred years, and the ashes and the offal formed a\nvery great heap, and they did so until the Empress Helena came to Jerusalem.  And Helena\nseized certain Jews and shut them up in prison until they told her where the grave of our\nLord Jesus Christ was, and she forced them to remove that hill, and the Honorable Cross\nwas discovered.  And she built a beautiful church for it, and she consecrated it, and she\nmade a great festival in honor thereof on the seventeenth day of Mesekerem, which is this\nday.  And all the Christian people came from all their countries to Jerusalem, and they\nmade a great festival in honor of the Honorable Cross, similar to the festival of the\nResurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.  Now as certain Christians were journeying along\nthe road, there was with them a certain man, a Samaritan, whose name was Isaac, and\nthere were many Samaritans with him.  And that Isaac the Samaritan was jibing at the\nChristians and reviling them and saying unto them, “Why do ye trouble yourselves in\nvain?   Why do ye go and bow down before a mere log of wood?”   And among the\nChristians was a certain righteous man, a priest whose name was ‘Odokis (Eudoxius), and\nas they were traveling along the road some of the Christians became thirsty, and they could\nnot find water to drink.  And they arrived at a certain well, and they found in it foul and\nbitter water, and they were suffering greatly from thirst.  And Isaac the Samaritan began to\nlaugh at them, and he said unto them, “If your faith was the True Faith this foul and bitter\nwater would change itself and would become sweet water.”   And when ‘Okokis\n(Eudoxius) the priest heard these words from him, he became moved with a divine zeal,\nand he debated with Isaac the Samaritan.  And Isaac the Samaritan said unto him, “If I saw\nany power in the Name of the Cross then I myself would believe in Christ.”  Then the holy\nman ‘Odokis (Eudoxius) prayed over that foul water, and it became sweet immediately,\nand all the people and their animals drank there from.   When Isaac the Samaritan was\nathirst and wished to drink of the water which was in his own water-skin, he found that it\nwas stinking and that there were worms in it.  And he wept very bitterly, and he came to\nSaint ‘Odokis (Eudoxius) the priest, and he bowed down at his feet, and he believed on the\nName of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And he drank of that water which had become sweet,\nthrough the prayer of the holy man ‘Odokis (Eudoxius).  Now there was in that water such\ngreat power that it became sweet to those who were believers and bitter to the infidels and\npagan folk.  And there appeared in that water a cross of light, and they built over that water\na beautiful church.  When Isaac the Samaritan came to the city of Jerusalem, he went to\nthe bishop, who baptized him with Christian baptism, him and all the men of his house,\nand they entered the Christian faith and became believers.   Now the Honorable Cross\nappeared unto them on the tenth day of Megabit, but as they were unable to celebrate a\nfestival in its honor during a fast, they celebrated its festival on the day of the consecration\nof the church, which was the seventeenth day of Mesekerem, the day of its appearance in\nthe holy tomb.\nAnd on this day also the blessed Theognosta died.  The holy woman lived in the days of\nthe righteous Emperors Honorius and Arcadius.  In those days an envoy came with gifts\n\nfrom the King of India to the righteous Emperors Honorius and Arcadius.  And when the\nenvoys of the King of India were returning, they found this virgin Theognosta with a book\nin her hand, which she was reading, and they seized her and carried her back with them to\ntheir country.  And she became the head of the harim, and she had charge of the wives of\nthe King of India, and of all the people of his house.  And in those days the son of the king\nfell sick of a grievous sickness, and Saint Theognosta took him into her bosom and made\nover him the sign of the Cross, and he recovered straightway.  And the report of this virgin\nwas heard throughout the land by reason of the wonderful thing which took place through\nher, and from that day onward she was no longer regarded as a handmaiden but as a great\nlady.  When the King of India went to war there came upon him clouds, and storm winds,\nand fog and darkness, and the king knowing of the wonder which the holy woman\nTheognosta had wrought by means of the Cross, made the sign of the Cross against the\nclouds, and the storm winds, and the fog and the darkness, and the sun appeared and there\nwas joy and great gladness, and through the sign of the Cross the king vanquished his\nenemies.  And as soon as the king returned from the war, he bowed down at the feet of\nSaint Theognosta, and asked her to give him holy Christian baptism, him, and the men of\nhis house, and all the men of his city.  And she said unto the king and unto all those who\nwere with him, “It is not seemly for me to do this thing, but send ye to the Emperor\nHonorius and ask him to send you a priest, for I am unable to baptize anyone.”   And\nstraightway the king sent a letter to the Emperor Honorius, and told him that they had\nwithdrawn [from Paganism] to the Faith of Christ, and he asked him to send to them a\npriest to baptize them with Christian baptism.  And Honorius sent unto them a priest who\nwas a righteous anchorite, and he baptized them with Christian baptism, and consecrated\nfor them the Offering, and gave them the Holy Body and Honorable Blood of our Lord\nJesus Christ.  And the virgin Theognosta, the beloved of God, rejoiced exceedingly, and\nshe knew that priestly anchorite, and they each blessed the other.  And she built for him a\nhouse for the religious, and very many virgins gathered together there, and they loved the\nnun’s garb of Theognosta and became like unto her.   When that priestly anchorite had\nbaptized them with Christian baptism, he returned to the Emperor Honorius, and related\nunto him how he had baptized the men of India, and how they had entered into the Faith of\nChrist.   And the emperor Honorius rejoiced exceedingly, and he commanded the\nArchbishop of the city of Rome to consecrate that anchorite bishop of the Indians; and the\narchbishop consecrated him bishop, and he returned to the Indians and they rejoiced\ngreatly.  Whilst they were building a church they wanted pillars, but there were none to be\nfound; now there was in that place a house of idols wherein were some very fine pillars. \nAnd the virgin Theognosta prayed to our Lord Jesus Christ with tears, and the pillars,\nwhich were in the house of idols removed themselves, and came to the church, and the\nbelievers glorified our Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom be praise!   And those who were\nworshippers of idols smashed their idols, and turned and entered the Faith of our Lord\nJesus Christ; and there was great joy in that city.  And Saint Theognosta the virgin ended\nher days, and she was well pleasing unto God, and she died in peace in that nunnery\namong the virgins.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Dionysius, Archbishop of the city of\nAlexandria; of the number of the archbishops he is the fourteenth.  The infidel Emperor\nDecius wished to kill this holy man, but God hid him from him.  This father was a wise\nand learned man, and he translated many of the Books of the Church.  In his days Saint\nMercurius became a martyr by the hand of Decius, the Emperor of Rome, and in his days\nalso the Seven Youths went to sleep for three hundred and seventy and two years. These\nYouths were among the sons of the elders of the city of Ephesus, and they fled from the\nEmperor Decius when he sought for them to make them worship idols.  And in the days of\nthis father lived our great and holy father Anthony the Egyptian, the head of the monks,\nwho built monasteries.  And this holy father Abba Dionysius sat as archbishop for nineteen\nyears, and he guarded his flock and the Gentiles in right and in peace; and he was well\npleasing unto God and he died.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Labiba (Liba), and ‘Akiryanos (Cirianus), and\nJustin, and Tekaseltes (Tekaleltes).\n\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and they were both righteous and fearers of God, and they walked in all His\njudgments.  And when Christos Mo’A, after the glad tidings of an angel, begat this child\nhe called him Ma’Akara ‘Egzi’E.  When he grew up he taught him the Psalms of David\nand the Books of the Church.  Then he took him to the monastery of Abba Zacharias, his\nmother’s brother, who when he saw him knew that the grace of God was dwelling upon\nhim, and he taught him all the rules of monasticism, and he arrayed him in the apparel of\nthe angels.   And the young man fasted and prayed with such intense devotion that the\nelders of the monastery marveled at the sternness of his strife; and he was girded with\nwisdom and knowledge.  After a short time he was made a deacon, and he ministered in\nthe church like Stephen the archdeacon.  And our Lord Jesus Christ appeared unto him\nwith Michael and Gabriel, and He embraced him and breathed into his face the Holy\nSpirit.  And He said unto him, “O my beloved Eustathius, I have chosen thee from thy\nmother’s womb, and heave appointed thee to become a teacher of many nations from\nEthiopia to Armenia.  And thou shalt preach the Gospel without fear and trepidation.  He\nwho heareth thee heareth Me; he who rejecteth thee rejecteth Me.”  When our Lord Jesus\nChrist had said this unto him He went up into heaven.  And Saint Eustathius went to the\nbishop and was appointed priest, and he began to preach the faith of the Gospel.  At length\nvery many men gathered together to him, and they became monks through him and they\nbecame disciples [of him], now the greatest of them was Abba ‘Absadi, and he turned\nmany from their iniquity, and at length they forsook their evil works.  And his doctrine\nfilled the whole earth, and in his days the honoring of Sabbaths and days of festival was\nestablished, and he turned not aside from [the ordinances of] the Apostles, neither to the\nright hand nor to the left.  And he made two pilgrimages to Jerusalem, and God made\nmanifest through him signs and wonders which were innumerable in opening the eyes of\nthe blind, and in healing the paralytics, and in casting out devils.  Then he decided that he\nwould go to Jerusalem by the will of God, and he gathered together his sons, and he laid\nupon them the charge of keeping all the canon of the monks, and of keeping themselves\nfrom mingling with the pagans; and he appointed his son ‘Absadi chief over them.  And he\nwent to Jerusalem and kept the Sabbath as he went, and he taught the faith of Christ.  And\nhe came to the Archbishop ‘Abba Benyamin and was blessed by him, and they conversed\ntogether on matters of the Faith.  Then he went down to Jerusalem and was blessed in the\nholy places, and was baptized in the Jordan.  Thence he departed to Armenia, and having\narrived at the sea of Jericho he asked the sailors to allow him to embark in a ship.  And\nwhen they prevented him from doing so, he cast his head-fillet into the sea, and said a\nblessing over it in the Name of the Trinity, and made over it the sign of the Cross.  Then he\ngot up upon the fillet as upon a ship, and two angels acted as sailors, and our Lord acted as\ncaptain, and they carried over his sons who had no fear of the terror of the sea.   And\nEustathius said unto his sons, “Only take heed that ye do not lay up revenge and malice in\nyour hearts; it seemeth to me however that one of you is about to perish.”  And before he\nhad finished uttering these words one of his sons dropped into the sea and was drowned\nbecause he was treasuring revenge and malice in his heart.   And by God’s will they\ncrossed over the sea and came to the country of Armenia, and he held converse with the\narchbishop, and did homage to him, and was blessed by him.  When the archbishop saw\nhim he rejoiced with exceeding great joy, and he received him gladly.   And our father\nEustathius continued to teach the men of Armenia the canons of the apostles, which are in\nthe ordinance of the Synod until they were all one brotherhood in doctrine.  When the time\nfor his departure from this world had drawn nigh, our Lord Jesus Christ appeared unto\nhim, and made a covenant with him in respect of those who should invoke his name, and\nthose who should celebrate his commemoration, and those who should do into writing the\n\nstory of his fight.  And when he died the bishops and priests prepared him for burial with\ngreat honor, and they buried him in the church of Mar Mehnam (i.e. Behnam) the martyr,\nand many miracles happened through his body.\nSalutation to Eustathius and to his fillet whereon he crossed the sea.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated Saint Helena, the mother of Constantine the\nrighteous emperor.  In the days of this holy woman the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, to\nwhom be praise, was found.\nAnd on this day also died Saint Abba ‘Onorewos (Honorius) the teacher [in the monastery]\nof Segadj.\nAnd on this day also Saint Mercurius became a martyr.  This holy man was a Persian jester\nand musician; originally he was a Christian.  When Constantine, the son of Constantine the\nGreat, died, there reined after him Julian the infidel, who slew Saint Mercurius.   Now\nJulian was the son of Constantine’s sister.  This denier of God worshipped idols, and he\nafflicted the Christian peoples grievously, and by his means very many became martyrs. \nWhen he was born there were gathered together those who jested and played music, and\nthose who made men laugh, and this holy man Mercurius was among their number.  And\nthe infidel Julian ordered the holy man to show him what the system of Christianity was,\nand what they did in church.  And Mercurius did according to what the infidel emperor\nhad commanded him, and he made a jest and mockery of all the ordinances of the Church. \nAnd there was very great merriment.   And when he was making a mockery of the\nordinance of holy Christian baptism, and was making the sign of the Cross over the water\nin the Name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, One God, the Lord illumined\nthe heart of Mercurius, and he saw the Divine Grace of God through heaven, and an\nexceedingly great light enveloped him.     And straightway Mercurius stripped off his\napparel, and went down into the water, and was dipped in the water three times in the\nName of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, One God.  Then he went up out of the\nwater, and put on his raiment and confessed that he was a Christian.  And the emperor was\nwroth with him and he threatened him, saying, “Unless thou doest as I command thee, and\nunless thou castest incense to the gods, I will torture thee with the greatest severity.  On\nthe other hand, if thou wilt hearken to my command I will give thee very much money and\nI will honor thee exceedingly.”  And Saint Mercurius answered and said unto him, “If thou\nwert to give me all the money in this world and the kingdom thereof, I would not deny my\nLord Jesus Christ.”  Then straightway the infidel emperor commanded his soldiers to cut\noff his holy head, and Mercurius received an incorruptible crown in the kingdom of the\nheavens.\nAnd on this day it is meet that we should celebrate also the festival of the Honorable and\nLife-giving Cross of our Lord and God Jesus Christ.\nAnd on this day also died the warrior Mar Jacob, the Egyptian.   This holy man had\nrighteous and believing parents, and they gave him as a votive offering to God.  When he\nhad finished his instruction in the school house his parents took him into the mountains of\nAlexandria, and they gave him to the Archimandrite Abba Gabriel, and he made him a\nmonk when he was a boy twelve years of age.  When he was twenty years of age he went\nforth with his teacher into the desert in order to strive in the ascetic life.  And they found\nthere a high tower, and at the bottom was a spring of water, and Abba Gabriel and Mar\nJacob went up to the top of the tower; and they used to draw water from the stream and\npour it out into hollows which were like troughs in the ground, and every day the wild\nanimals of the desert used to come there and drink there from.  And the holy man Mar\nJacob used to milk them, and make cheese from the milk, and he and his teacher lived\nthereon.  When Abba Gabriel died, Mar Jacob went up to the top of the tower, and by the\nWill of God there came to him twelve desert monks, and they dwelt with him in fasting\nand prayer, and they lived upon the milk of the animals, and the want of wheat for the\nmonastery was supplied by the pilgrims who came from afar.  One day they said, “It is our\ndesire to see Abba Moses the Black (i.e. the Ethiopian), and to be blessed by him.”  And\n\nSatan because he coveted to be loved by them, took the form of Abba Moses the Black,\nand he came flying on his wings and said unto them, “Why do ye trouble me to drag\nmyself from mine own place, seeing that I am an old man?”  And they said unto him, “We\nwish to hear the word of life from thy lips, and we wish thee to bless us.”  And he said\nunto them, “How do ye live?”   And they said that they poured out water for the wild\nanimals of the desert, and that when they came to drink, they milked them and lived upon\ntheir milk each evening.  And Satan said unto them, “Will ye not listen unto what I shall\ncommand you?”  And they said unto him, “Yea.”  And Satan said unto them, “Take ye not\nthe milk of the beasts and ye shall not do violence unto them, for ye are monks.  And fast\nye forty days at a time, and do not pray the Psalms of David, for David took the wife of\nUriah by violence and slew him.”  And he addressed a very large number of profitless\nexhortations to them so that he might ensnare them by his wiles, and they received his\nwords imagining that they were the words of Abba Moses the Black.  Then the Holy Ghost\nmade Mar Jacob to understand that his words were the teaching of Satan, and he\ncommanded his disciples to consecrate the Offering on the first day of the week, and\nafterwards he showed his sons that the words that had been said to them were of Satan. \nAnd Satan came unto him again disguised as the Archbishop of Alexandria, and there were\nbishops with him, and when he came he cursed them and anathematized them, saying,\n“Why are ye living here without my permission?” And Saint Abba Jacob saw the extent of\nhis power with his disciples, and he made a prayer, and straightway Satan disappeared and\nhis counsel did not remain.  Sometimes Satan came unto him in the form of a serpent, and\nsometimes in the form of a king, and sometimes in the forms of beautiful virgins, and\nsometimes he took the forms of eagles and ravens that tore [his] face with their claws. \nAnd he was tempted for seven years.  Then when God saw his weariness and his prayer,\nHe sent lightning from heaven, and it rent Satan in pieces, and scattered him like smoke. \nAnd Satan cried out, saying, “Woe is me by reason of thee, O Jacob, for thy prayer hath\nburned me up.”  And then God commanded Mar Jacob to go to the monastery of ‘Abdin,\nand he told his sons this, and having laid upon them the charge that they were to dwell in\nthe tower, he departed alone to the shore of Jericho.  And as there was no ship there, he\nblessed a wave of the sea, and he embarked upon it, and traveled upon it as upon dry land\nuntil he crossed the sea and arrived at Tarsus.  And as he passed through a market-place in\nthe city, he found a wounded man with worms devouring him.  And the holy man said unto\nhim, “What is thy name?”  And the man said unto him, “My name is ‘Anthony’; my father\ngave me money for the physicians, and they have not healed me.”  And Mar Jacob saw\nthat the man was grieving because of his disease, and he made a prayer, and laid his hands\non every part of his body, and said unto him, “In the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ be\nmade whole,” and straightway the man was healed.  And forthwith Anthony followed him\nand became his disciple.  Then the holy man and his disciple went on their way, and when\nthey arrived at the city of ‘Amid they found the son of King Anestus mad, and he was\nbeating his head on the stones, and no one could restrain him.  And Mar Jacob commanded\nhis disciple Anthony to seize him, and to bring him to him; and when he arrived he made\nover him the sign of the Honorable Cross, and he commanded Satan in the Name of our\nLord Jesus Christ to go forth from him.  And Satan went forth from him in the form of a\nblack slave, and the young man recovered and followed the holy man; and when his father\nand the people saw him they rejoiced with very great joy.  Now the king wished to give\nMar Jacob much money, but the holy man refused it and would not take it.  And by the\ncommandment of God he departed with Abba Barsabo, a teacher of the monastery of the\ncity of ‘Abdin, and as he was traveling on the road Anthony fell sick of the smallpox, and\non the third day he died.   And when Mar Jacob came to a city, the name of which is\n‘Awersa, he found that the son of the governor was sick, and through the prayer of the holy\nman Mar Jacob he recovered.  When his father saw that he had recovered he rejoiced with\nvery great joy, and he handed him over to the holy man to be his disciple until the day of\nhis death. Now the name of the young man was Fekur.  And when they drew nigh unto the\nmonastery of Barsabo, the monks welcomed them and brought them in with much\nsinging.  Now there was built by the side of this city a certain temple, and the King of\nPersia, who was called Samer, used to come there every year and celebrate a festival in\nhonor of his idols.  And Mar Jacob said unto the monks, “Behold, we have heard that the\nKing of Persia hath come, let us go to him and shed out blood for the sake of the Name of\n\nChrist, to Whom be praise!”   And whilst the monks were considering this advice the\nsoldiers of the king arrived in the monastery, and they saw that the monks were wearing\nblack apparel, and they said unto them, “What are ye?   Which of the gods do ye\nworship?”  And the holy men said, “We worship the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the\nLiving God, Who came down from heaven, and became man through the Holy Ghost by\nMary the holy Virgin, to Him do we bow down and Him do we worship.”   When the\nsoldiers heard them they carried them away to the king, and when they arrived before the\nking they confessed the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And the king enquired what their\ncountry was, and Abba Barsabo said, “I and my brethren are Romans,” and Saint Abba\nJacob saith, “I am by myself; I am an Egyptian.”   When the king heard his words he\ncommanded his soldiers to remove Jacob against his will, for he did not wish to kill him\nbecause he had a treaty with the men of Egypt.  And the king ordered his soldiers to beat\nthe monks, and they beat them until their blood flowed from their bodies like water, and he\nthen had them cast into the prison house [where] the angel of the Lord healed them; on the\nfollowing day when the soldiers found them alive, the king [promised to] bestow many\ngifts upon them.   But when they treated his word with contempt he commanded his\nsoldiers to torture them by crushing their feet into [iron] boots, and by beating them, and\ndrawing out their front teeth, and grinders, and by drawing out of the nails of the hands\nand feet, and by cutting off their noses, and lips, and ears; this they did for a period of six\ndays; but our Lord Jesus Christ gave them strength [to endure].  On the eighth day he\ncommanded the soldiers to cut off their heads, and Mar Barsabo addressed them, and after\nhe had exhorted them, he delivered them one by one into the hand of the swordsman, and\nten monks were crowned.  And the captain of the horse of the king on seeing the crowning\nof the saints stripped off his apparel and confessed our Lord Jesus Christ, and his head also\ndid they cut off with the sword.  After the sons of Mar Barsabo were dead he himself\nstretched out his neck, and said unto the swordsman, “Finish what thou hast been\ncommanded [to do],” and straightway he gave him his neck.  And the martyrdoms of the\nsaints were finished on the twenty-eighth day of the month Nehasse (Aug. 7 - Sept. 5). \nThen the king ordered his soldiers to burn their bodies with fire, but the earth opened her\nmouth and covered them.   And the king being ashamed wanted to depart to his own\ncountry.  Thereupon Mar Jacob prayed to God and He rained upon him fire [mingled] with\nblack clouds, and hail and snow, and he and all his soldiers perished, and not one of them\nremained [alive].  When the men on the frontiers heard this they all went out and took their\nhorses and all their goods, and they carried them to Mar Jacob and said unto him, “Take all\nthese goods for thy needs,” but he refused to do so, and commanded them to build a little\nchurch over the grave of the holy martyrs; [and they did so] and there it remaineth unto\nthis day.  One day there was a plague (or smallpox) in a certain city, and the people sent to\nMar Jacob asking him to help them by his prayers; and when Mar Jacob heard of the\nplague he was very sorry.  And having taken the censer he went into the church, and he\nprayed a long time, and having gone forth from the church he said unto the messengers,\n“Be not afraid, neither grieve ye; depart ye in peace.”  When the messengers arrived they\nfound the city in a healthy state, and they praised the God of Saint Jacob.  And there was a\ncertain maiden who came with her father to the holy man, and she lusted for the holy\ndisciple whose name we have mentioned, and she wanted to cast him down in sin.  When\nhe refused her she became with child by a certain servant of her father, and she acted\ncraftily in the matter.  When her father heard of this he set out to kill Mar Jacob and his\ndisciple, and as he was going along the road [to do so] lightning fell upon him and blinded\nhis eyes.  After a few days his daughter brought forth her child, and she carried the child to\nsaint Mar Jacob in the midst of the congregation.  And Mar Jacob said unto the child, “In\nthe Name of the Lord Jesus Christ I command thee to declare the name of thy father.”  And\nthe child said, “My father is so-and-so, the servant of my mother’s father”; and when the\npeople heard this they marveled and praised God.  When the time of Mar Jacob’s departure\nfrom the world drew nigh, he commanded his disciple Daniel, saying, “Behold my\ndeparture draweth nigh.  When I am dead bury me with Mar Barsabo and his sons.”  Three\ndays after this he died in peace, and the angels took his soul up into Jerusalem.\nSalutation to Jacob the strenuous ascetic!\nSalutation to Jacob the priest!\n\nAnd on this day also is commemorated Saint Stephen the priest, and Niceta the martyr.\nAnd on this day also were found the bones of Thomas and of Archbishop Athanasius; and\non this day are commemorated our father the admirable Philotheus [the Thaumaturge], and\nAbba Nob the anchorite, and the martyrs who were with ‘Aboli - forty men and twenty\nwomen.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated ‘Efomya (Euphemia) the martyr, and Abba\nFinomis, and Selhan, and ‘Akalaeles, and Isaac.\nAnd on this day also took place the miracle which Thomas the apostle wrought when he\nwent to preach the Gospel in the country of India.  Now he was afraid, and he said, “How\ncan I go to India, the country of which I know not?”  Then our Lord Jesus Christ appeared\nunto him and said unto him, “Fear thou not, for My grace is with thee.”  And whilst he was\nwith our Lord there came a merchant from India.  And our Lord said unto him, “What dost\nthou want?”  And the merchant said, “I want a carpenter”; and he sold him for three letra\nof silver.  And he wrote a paper which testified, saying, “I have sold my servant, the son of\nJoseph the carpenter, to ‘Abenes, a merchant of Gona”; and Thomas’s [new] master took\nhim to the city of the king.  When they drew nigh unto the city they heard [the sound of]\norgans and pipes, and they said, “What is this?”  And the people said unto them, “The king\nhas made a marriage-feast for his daughter, and he has ordered that whosoever doth not\ncome to the wedding shall be punished.”  And ‘Abenes and Thomas went into the room of\nthe feast, and while the guests ate and drank Thomas the apostle ate nothing at all.  And\nthere he found a Hebrew singing maiden who was singing songs in the Hebrew language. \nAnd whilst the apostle was praying in the Hebrew language one of those who were at the\nfeast struck him; and the apostle said, “I see a hand with the dogs tearing at it”; and the\nsinging woman alone heard him because he spoke in the Hebrew Language.  And the man\nwho smote Thomas went down to the lake (or well) to draw water, and a lion sprang out\nand slew him and left him lying in pieces.  And a dog seized the right hand and carried it\nin among the people at the feast, and one said unto Thomas, “Who is dead?”  And he said\nunto them, “This is the hand of him who struck one who serveth.”   When the singing\nmaiden heard this, she cast sway her tambourine and went and sat at the feet of the apostle,\nand she said, “I heard thee say unto him, ‘The gods shall tear the hand which smote me.’” \nWhen the people heard this some believed and some did not.  When the king heard this he\nsaid unto Thomas, “Come and pray over my daughter, for this day have I given her in\nmarriage.”  And when the apostle had entered the marriage-chamber he prayed to the Lord\nin the form of Thomas, on behalf of the bride and bridegroom, and admonished them with\nthe words of faith, and they believed the words of the apostle, and abandoned their\nmarriage.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

When he arrived in the\ncity of Antioch the report of him was heard therein, and a certain young man, the son of\none of the elders of the city of Antioch, heard of him.  Now the young man lusted for a\ncertain Christian virgin who was called Justina, whom he had seen going to church; and\nhis heart was hot like the fire which blazeth because of his longing and his love for her. \nAnd he was unable to obtain her either by the gift of money, or by the threat of death, or\nby the operation of sorcery.  When the young man heard of the arrival of Saint Cyprianus\nin the city of Antioch, and knew that he was reported to be superior to every man in\nAntioch through his sorcery, straightway he went to him, and told him about the sorrow in\nhis heart, caused by the virgin Justina, and how he longed for her, and how he loved her\nexceedingly, but could not obtain possession of her.  And Saint Cyprianus promised him,\nsaying, “Fear thou not, I will fulfill for thee all thy desire.”  And he directed against her all\nthe works of his sorcery, but failed to obtain possession of her.  Every time when he sent\nagainst her any of the powers of Satan, he found her praying, and they were unable to\nstand before her, and they were powerless to fight against her.  When Cyprianus was tired\nand was unable to gain the mastery over her, he called the Satans, and said unto them, “If\nye are not able to bring Justina the virgin to me, I shall turn and become a Christian.”  And\nthe chief of the Satans meditated and thought out one device whereby he might seduce her,\nand that was by making one of his Satans to disguise himself and to take the form of\nJustina, and then to make him to appear to Cyprianus as if he were showing him Justina. \nAnd that Satan did as Satan his master commanded him, and he hastened and made him\nknown to Cyprianus.   And he said unto him, “Behold Justina is coming to thee”; and\nCyprianus rejoiced exceedingly, and he imagined that it was true, and he sat down and\nwaited.  And behold, Satan disguised as Justina came unto him, and Cyprianus rejoiced,\nand rose up straightway to embrace her by reason of his great joy in her, and he said unto\nher, “Good is thy coming, O Justina, queen of women.”  And as soon as he had uttered her\nname only, that Satan who had disguised himself as Justina melted away and disappeared\nlike smoke, and there was a fetid smell [there].  And Cyprianus knew that this thing was a\ndebased and deceitful trick of Satan; and if Satan did not dare to stand before her face, and\ncould not endure the mention of her name, how could he have the power to seduce her? \nAnd Cyprianus rose up straightway and burnt and destroyed his books of magic, and was\nbaptized with Christian baptism by the Archbishop of Antioch.  Then he became a monk,\nand after a few days he was made a deacon, and a little later a priest.  And when he had\ngrown old in doing good works and in the doctrine of the Church, he became fit to be\nbishop of the city of Cartagena in the country of the West.  And he took Saint Justina and\nmade her the abbess of a house of virgins.   When a General Council of the saints\nassembled in the city of ... this holy man was one of those who were assembled there.  And\nafter many days Decius the infidel emperor heard of Cyprinaus and Justina, and he had\nthem brought before him, and he demanded from them a denial of Christ, and he\nendeavored to make them worship idols.  When they would not obey his command, he\ntortured them with very great severity.  After this he ordered his soldiers to cut off their\nheads with the sword, and they cut off their heads and Cyprianus and Justina received\nincorruptible crowns of martyrdom in the kingdom of heaven.\n\nAnd on this day it is meet for us to celebrate a festival of commemoration of our Lady, the\nholy Virgin Mary.  [A note in the Bodleian MS. says that this festival must be kept on the\n21st of every month of the year.]\nAnd on this day also there took place the death of Saint Tiberius the apostle, one of the\nSeventy-two disciples.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

the sun, and he afflicted and\ntortured many believing men, and no man throughout his country dared to mention the\nName of Christ.  And his son Kotolos (Cotylus) had a friend whose name was Tatos, and\nhe was governor of the country of the Maydaswiyan; and certain people laid information\nagainst him before Sapor the king, and told him that he was a Christian.  And the king sent\nto him a certain noble whose name was Tumager to find out whether that which was said\nabout Tatos was true or not, and he commanded that noble, if he found that Tatos was a\nChristian, to inflict heavy punishment upon him.  When Kotolos (Cotylus), the son of the\nKing of Persia, heard these words, he rose up and went to that country where his friend\nTatos was.  When the noble arrived in that country and found that Tatos was a Christian,\neven as the king had been informed, straightway he ordered his men to make an oven red-\nhot and to roast him to death in it.  And Saint Tatos made the sign of the Cross over his\nface against the fire, and the fire died down and was extinguished.   When Kotolos\n(Cotylus), the son of the king, saw this miracle, he marveled exceedingly, and he said to\nTatos his friend, “How didst thou learn this magic, O my brother?”  And Tatos answered\nand said unto him, “This is not magic, O my brother, but it is through faith in our Lord\nJesus Christ that signs and wonders like this are performed.”   And Kotolos (Cotylus)\nbelieved on our Lord Jesus Christ.  And they lighted a fire and made it to burn until the\nflames thereof reached a great height, and Kotolos (Cotylus) drew nigh unto the fire, and\nhe made the sign of the Cross over it, and the fire turned backwards a distance of twelve\ncubits.   And the noble wrote his dispatch and sent it to Sapor the king, and in it he\ninformed him what had happened to Tatos and to Kotolos (Cotylus), the son of the King of\nPersia.  And the king sent messengers and had them brought to him, and his men cut off\nthe head of Tatos with the sword, and he received the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom\nof heaven.  His son Kotolos (Cotylus) he tortured with great severity, and he delivered him\nover to another noble who was to torture him, and when this noble had tortured him\ncruelly he shut him up in prison.  And ‘Aksu, his sister came unto him in the prison house,\nfor the king had sent her a message that she must persuade him to return to his former\nrelations with him.  And Saint Kotolos (Cotylus) admonished his sister, and he taught her\nthe Right Faith, and straightway she turned from her error, and believed on our Lord Jesus\nChrist.   Then Kotolos (Cotylus) sent his sister to a certain priest and he baptized her\nsecretly with Christian baptism, and she returned to her father the king and said unto him,\n“It would be a good thing for thee if there happened to thee what hath happened to me and\nto my brother Kotolos (Cotylus).  For there is no God but Jesus Christ, the Son of the\nLiving God, Who hath made the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and all that is\ntherein.”  And when the king her father heard these words from her he was exceedingly\nwroth with her, and he commanded his men to torture her very severely, and they did so\nuntil she yielded up her soul unto the hand of the Lord, and she received the crown of\nmartyrdom in the kingdom of heaven.  And he tied her brother Saint Kotolos (Cotylus) to\nthe tails of horses and he made him to run behind them over the mountains until he yielded\nup his soul into the hand of His Creator.  Then he had his body cut into three parts, and his\nmen cast them out on the tops of the hills so that the birds of heaven might consume them. \nThus Saint Kotolos (Cotylus) finished his strife, and received the crown of martyrdom in\nthe kingdom of heaven.  When the king’s soldiers had departed the Lord commanded the\npriests and the holy deacons to take the bodies of the martyrs, and they went by night and\ntook the bodies of the martyrs, and they went by night and took the bodies of the saints,\nand they found that they had become as white as snow.  And they prepared them for burial\nwith honour, and they laid them in a beautiful tomb until the end of the days of\npersecution.  After the days of the persecution they built a beautiful church for them, and\n\nlaid the bodies of the saints therein, and through them very many signs and wonders were\nwrought.\nOn this day also Saint Julius became a martyr.   This holy man came from the city of\n‘Akfehas, and our Lord set him up to care for the bodies of the holy martyrs, and to write\nthe history of their contending and to prepare their bodies for burial, and to dispatch each\nbody to its native city.  And the Lord brought blindness into the hearts of the governors,\nand they never held converse with Saint Julius about any matter whatsoever, and they\nnever forced him to worship idols, for the Lord protected him for the sake of His servants\nthe martyrs.  And there were three hundred men who knew how to write, and they used to\nwrite the histories of the contending of the holy martyrs.  And Julius used to minister to the\nholy martyrs, and dress their wounds with healing medicines with his own hand, and the\nmartyrs used to bless him and declare unto him, saying, “Thou art as if thou hadst poured\nout thine own blood for the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be reckoned\namong the number of the martyrs.”  When the days of the reign of Diocletian the infidel\nemperor were ended, Constantine the righteous emperor reigned.  And our Lord wished to\nplace and to associate Saint Julius with the number of the holy martyrs and all the\nrighteous saints.   And our Lord Christ commanded Saint Julius to go to the city of\nGamnudi in the northern part of the country of Egypt, to Armenius the governor, and to\nconfess before him his belief on the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And Saint Julius\nwent, as our Lord Jesus Christ had commanded him, to Armenius the governor, and he\nconfessed before him that he believed on the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ; and the\ngovernor tortured him many times, and God raised him up whole and unharmed.  Then\nSaint Julius prayed to God and entreated Him to let the earth open her mouth and swallow\nup the idols.  And straightway the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the seventy\nidols, and their one hundred and forty priests.  Now the governor had commended his men\nto bring Saint Julius to him so that he might bow down to the idols; and straightway they\nand their priests were destroyed and they went down into Sheol forever.  And very many\nof the people who were there when they saw this miracle marveled exceedingly, and they\nbelieved on our Lord Jesus Christ and became martyrs.  When Armenius the governor saw\nthat his gods and their priests were destroyed he believed on our Lord Jesus Christ, and\nwent with Saint Julius to the governor of Athribis and confessed before him his belief on\nthe Name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And the governor of Athribis tortured Saint Julius with\nvery great severity, but our Lord Christ raised him up safely and unharmed; Julius died\nthrice, and our Lord Jesus Christ raised him up from the dead thrice.  One day there was to\nbe a festival in honour of the idols, and the people were decorating the temple with all\nkinds of ornaments and lamps, and with palm branches, and branches of other trees, and\nthey closed the gates of the temple; and the people expected to come on the following day\nand to celebrate the festival.  And Saint Julius entreated God to blot out their idols, and\nstraightway God sent an angel who smashed the heads of the idols, and blackened their\nfaces with charcoal and ashes, and burnt up all the palm branches, and destroyed all the\nother decorations of the temple.  On the following day when the people dressed in apparel\nof great price came to do according to their custom, and saw how their idols had been\ndestroyed, they recognized the impotence of their idols, and thy conversed among\nthemselves and said, “If our idols are not able to save themselves, how will they have the\npower to save us?”  And straightway the governor of Athribis believed on our Lord Jesus\nChrist, and very many men, the number whereof could not be counted, did the same. \nFrom this place also Saint Julius departed to the city of Tuwa, and with him were the\ngovernor of the city of Gamnudi and the governor of the city of Athribis.  And Saint Julius\nspoke unto Iskander the governor of Tuwa, and said unto him, “Finish my strife for me,\nand command thy men to cut off my head and let me receive the crown of martyrdom, and\ndepart to my Lord Jesus Christ.”  And Iskander said unto him, “I will not torture thee, and\nI will do nothing evil unto thee whatsoever.”   And Saint Julius commanded his five\nhundred slaves to sharpen their swords, and to rise up against Iskander.  And they said\n[unto him], “If thou dost not command [his soldiers] to cut off the heads of all of us, so\nthat we may become martyrs of Christ, we will kill thee.”  Then Julius commanded an\nunclean spirit to ride Iskander, and straightway the unclean spirit did so, and Iskander\nwrote a decree ordering his servants to cut off the heads of the slaves of Julius with the\n\nsword.  And straightway the soldiers cut off the heads of all the saints, that is to say, of\nSaint Julius, and Saint Theodore his son, and Saint Ionias his brother, and his five hundred\nslaves, and the governor of Gamnudi, and the governor of Athribis, and a great many\n[other] people.   Now the number of those who became martyrs on the day of the\nmartyrdom of Saint Julius was fifteen hundred, and they all received their crowns of\nmartyrdom in the kingdom of heaven.  And they took the bodies of Saint Julius and his son\nand his brother, and carried them to the city of Alexandria, for there he used to live,\nalthough he was born in the city of ‘Akfehas, and they laid them in a beautiful tomb.\nAfterwards they built over them a beautiful church wherein many signs and wonders took\nplace.\nThree salutation to Julius, Theodore and Ionias.\nAnd on this day is commemorated Balan.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

then they\nrequired from him that he should marry a wife, but this thing he refused [to do].  After this\nthey brought him to the bishop, and he appointed him a full deacon.  And Gregory used to\ngo continually to Abba Pachomius, and learn from him the way of God, and took very\nmuch money from his parents and brought it to the Holy Father Abba Pachomius.  And he\nmade many petitions unto him, beseeching him to give this money to those who built\nmonasteries, but Saint Abba Pachomius devoted it to the building of a church, and a\nlodging for the monks and for his own meetings.  And after this he renounced the whole\nworld, and all the goods and possessions thereof, and he went to Abba Pachomius, who\narrayed him in the garb of the monastic life.  And Gregory dwelt with him, and labored\nboth in soul and body, and he fought a great fight with fasting and prayer, in lowliness, and\nhumility and submission, and gentleness and love.  Even the fornicators when they saw\nhim learned from his appearance and example the fear of God, and they forsook their evil\ndeeds and repented, and became men of clean lives.  And he dwelt with Abba Pachomius\nfor thirteen years.  When Saint Abba Macarius came to Abba Pachomius, and dwelt with\nhim for a few days (now he wanted to return to the desert of Scete), this holy man Gregory\nentreated Saint Abba Pachomius, saying, “O my father, permit me to go with Saint Abba\nMacarius to the desert of Scete,” and he commanded him to go with him, and Saint\nGregory went with Saint Abba Macarius, and he dwelt with him for many years.  Then he\nasked Saint Abba Macarius to allow him to live the life of an anchorite in the desert for a\nlittle; and he said, “Do what thou wishest.”  And he departed into the mountain and dug\nout a small cave for himself, and he dwelt there for seven years.  And he used to come to\nSaint Abba Macarius twice each year, once at the time of the festival of the birth of the\nGlorious One, and once on the day of the festival of the resurrection of our Lord Jesus\nChrist; and he partook of the Holy Mysteries [on each occasion] and returned to his cave. \nAnd Abba Macarius questioned him about all his work each year, and he revealed unto\nhim everything, which he saw, and Abba Macarius used to lay down for him the ascetic\nlabors of the monastic life, which he had to perform.  When he had completed two and\ntwenty years of strife God wished to give him rest from this world.  And He sent to him an\nangel who said unto him, “After three days thou shalt depart from this fleeting world, and\nshalt enter everlasting life.”  And Saint Gregory called the elders of the desert of Scete,\nand embraced them, and asked them to remember him, and they also asked him to\nremember them before God; and after three days he died and went into everlasting life.\nAnd on this day also died Saint Bedratos (Quadratus), one of the two and seventy disciples\nwhom our Lord Jesus Christ chose.  This holy apostle was one of the sons of the elders of\nAthens, and he was one of their learned nobles;

and when they had cast lots among themselves the lot fell upon Jonah\nthe prophet.  And the captain said unto him, “What hast thou done that through thee such\nan affliction should come upon us?”  And Jonah said unto them, “Cast me into the sea and\nye shall be saved.”  And the captain and the crew entreated God, saying, “O God, demand\nThou not from us the blood of this man”; and they took him and cast him into the sea, and\na great whale swallowed him.  And he remained in the belly of the whale for three days\nand three nights, and then the whale cast him up on the seashore.   And Jonah rose up\nstraightway and came into the city of Nineveh, and he preached unto the people thereof\neven as God the Most High had commanded him, and he said unto them, “Know ye that\nthree days from this day, your city shall be overthrown, and ye shall all be destroyed”; and\nhe went round about the city of Nineveh for a space of three days.  When the men of\nNineveh heard the preaching of Jonah the prophet they were exceedingly afraid, and they\nbelieved on God and they repented and fasted and put on sackcloth made of hair and sat in\nthe ashes.  Then the king commanded that a herald should go round about proclaiming\nthus:  “The king hath commanded that his nobles, and all the people, great and small, and\nwomen and children, and sheep and oxen and goats shall fast, and that they shall neither\neat nor drink any water whatsoever, and they shall put on sackcloth made of hair; and\nsimilarly, even the beasts shall not eat grass.  And let all men forsake their evil works, that\nis to say, oppression, and fornication, and lying, and theft, and fraud, and blasphemy, in\norder that God may, peradventure, have mercy upon you, and remove His wrath from\nyou.”  And straightway all the people repented, and they fasted, and begged for mercy\nfrom God, blessed be His Name, and God had mercy on them.  And the prophet Jonah was\nsad with a very great sadness, and he said, “O God, take my life, for death is more\npreferable to me than life.”  And Jonah went outside the city and sat down there and fell\nasleep.  And God commanded a root of the cucumber plant, and it sprouted and grew into\n\na large plant, and it had offshoots and it became very leafy, and very high, and it cast its\nshadow over Jonah as he was sleeping.  And Jonah woke up from his sleep and saw the\ncucumber plant, and he rejoiced with great joy.  And on the following day God brought\nslumber upon Jonah, and he fell asleep, and God commanded a worm to gnaw the\ncucumber plant, and the root thereof was cut through; and God commanded a wind-storm\nand it withered the cucumber plant, and the sun scorched Jonah’s head, and he woke from\nhis dream.  When he saw that the cucumber plant had withered he was exceedingly sorry,\nand he demanded for himself death.   And God said unto Jonah, “Art thou exceedingly\nsorry that the cucumber plant hath withered?”   And Jonah said, “Yea, O Lord, I am\nexceedingly sorry, even unto death.”   And God said unto him, “If thou art sorry for a\ncucumber plant which thou didst neither sow nor plant, and for which thou hast in no way\nlabored, but which flourished in a day, and withered in a day, why should I not spare\nNineveh, the great city wherein dwell more than ten hundred thousand men who know not\ntheir right hands from their left hands, besides very many beasts?  For I am the Merciful\nand the Compassionate God, Who shows mercy upon every one, who turneth from his sins\nand repenteth.”  And Jonah rose up and returned to the land of Israel and he died there. \nAnd the prophecy of Jonah [was made] two hundred years and more before the advent of\nour Lord Jesus Christ, and he prophesied in the days of ‘Amos the king and his son\n‘Ozyan.  And all the days of his life were one hundred years, seventy years as a prophet,\nand thirty years before he prophesied.  Salutation to Jonah who slept in the belly of the\nwhale.\nSalutation to Barbarah, and to Juliana, who appeared to two men when they came to steal\nthe book containing her history, and slew one and blinded the other.  [This paragraph is\nwanting in the Bodleian MS.]\nSalutation to those who are saturated with the Law and the Gospel.  [This paragraph is\nwanting in the Bodleian MS.]\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Roka (Foka), and John, and Andrew, and Peter,\nand Antonius.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and he abandoned his former name and called himself\n“Eustathius.”   And straightway all his property disappeared, and his slaves, and his\nhandmaidens, and his horses; and he took his wife and his sons, and he went forth from the\ncity of Rome and embarked in a ship.  Now he took with him neither any money to pay for\ntheir passage, nor anything else which he could give the captain [in its stead].  When they\narrived in port the captain took his wife instead of passage money, and Eustathius took his\ntwo sons and departed.  And he came to another stream which he had to cross, and he took\nup one of his sons on his back to take him over the river, and he passed over; and he\nreturned to his other son to carry him across the river, but he found him not, because a\nwolf had seized him.  Now a lion had seized and carried off his other son.  And Eustathius\nsorrowed with a very great sorrow because of the loss of his wife and his sons, but God,\ngreat in counsel, in Whom there is power, protected both of them unharmed.   And\nEustathius went on to a certain city, and he became a guard of the village and remained\none for many days.  After those days the Emperor of Rome died, and there reigned in his\nstead another emperor who enquired for Eustathius and found him not.   And he sent\nmessengers out into all the district to seek for him, and one of those messengers who had\nbeen sent out by the emperor to seek for Eustathius came to the village wherein he dwelt. \nAnd the two men recognized each other, and they embraced, and the messenger carried\nEustathius to the emperor in great honour.  When Eustathius arrived the emperor honored\nhim exceedingly, and appointed him to the position in which he was formerly.  And the\nemperor commanded that two men should be recruited from every city for use in war. \nNow the two sons of Eustathius were brought up in the same city, neither knowing the\nother.  One day, when the two sons of Eustathius, who had been placed in that city, were\ntalking together, they discovered that they were brothers; and then [the messengers] took\nthem to the city of Rome and God was please to set them in the house of business of their\nfather who did not know them.  As concerning their mother whom the pagan captain of the\nship seized, God protected her and delivered her uninjured from his hand; now she was a\nkeeper of the gardens of the city of Rome.  And the two young men came to the village\nwhere their mother was, and whilst they were holding converse together, the younger\nbrother spoke, and their mother recognized that they were her sons, and she embraced\nthem, and rejoiced in them, and they rejoiced in her exceedingly.  And the three of them\nmet together and they went to Eustathius and informed him what had happened to them,\nand he knew that the woman was his wife, and that the young men were his sons, and they\nembraced each other and rejoiced together greatly.  Thus they were all gathered together\n[again] in one place, even as God had promised them.  And they dwelt together, and whilst\nmarveling they praised God, blessed be His Name, because He had done good things for\nthem.   After this the emperor who loved Eustathius died, and there reigned another\nemperor who worshipped idols; and he summoned Eustathius and his wife and his sons,\nand had them brought unto him.  And he said unto them, “Cast incense to my gods.”  And\n\nthe holy men said, “We will not worship idols, and we will not bow down to them, for we\nbow down to our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Living God.”  And straightway the\nemperor was wroth with them, and he commanded his soldiers to torture them, and they\ntortured them very severely, but God raised them up whole and unharmed.   Then he\ncommanded his soldiers to cast them into a brazen cauldron, and [when] they had done so\nhe commanded to light a fire on top of them, and thus they delivered their souls into the\nhand of God, and they received crowns of martyrdom from our Lord Jesus Christ.\nAnd on this day also died the holy woman Tekla (Thecla) who was a martyr without the\nshedding of blood.   This holy woman had parents, who were rich and honorable\nMacedonians, and they brought her up strictly according to the custom of their country;\nnow they worshipped idols.  When Paul arrived in the country of Macedonia, he began to\npreach in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, saying, “Blessed are those who are poor for\nrighteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  Blessed are those who have a\nwife and who are as if they had not one, for they shall inherit everlasting life”--these and\nsuch like words.  When Saint Thecla heard these words, she remained in the upper floor of\nher house and only came down for food and drink.  And her mother said unto her, “Why\ndost thou not come down form the upper floor of thy house, and why dost thou not eat?” \nAnd she came down from the upper floor of her house, and went to Paul secretly, and she\nbribed the doorkeeper of her house with her hair-comb of gold not to talk about her\n[leaving the house].  When Paul saw her he received her gladly and taught her the Faith of\nChrist.  On the following day when her mother came to Paul she found Thecla sitting with\nhim, and she went to the governor and reported to him that her daughter was a Christian. \nAnd the governor commanded his soldiers to bring Thecla with Paul, and when they had\nbrought her he was wroth with Paul and ordered them to cast him into the fire; [and they\ndid so] but God delivered him.  And the governor commanded them to cast Thecla into the\nfire, and all the children of the city assembled to look upon her torture.  And without the\nuse of force on the part of the soldiers she threw herself into the flames after having made\nover herself the sign of the Cross; and she went forth from the midst of the fire, which had\nnot touched her.  And she went to Paul, and shaved off her hair, and girded herself with a\nbelt and followed Paul.  When another governor heard this he seized her and pressed her to\nabandon the Christian Faith, and when she refused he cast her into a den of lions and\nbears, and these animals bowed down before her and licked the dust off her feet.  When\nthe governor and those who were with him saw that life was hers, they believed and were\nbaptized in the Name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost.   And Thecla\ncontinued to follow Paul, and to preach in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ; and having\nworked many miracles she died in peace.\nOn this day also died Saint Antilarius.  This holy man was an officer of the tax-gatherers,\nand he had no mercy on anyone.  One day certain poor folk were sitting in the sun, and\nthey began to mention the names of the charitable and the avaricious, and they mentioned\nthe name of Antilarius as that of a man who had never bestowed any alms on any one of\nthem.  And one of the poor said, “What will ye give me if I succeed in drawing a gift from\nhim?”  And they promised to give him something.  And the needy man went to Antilarius\nand begged for alms from him, and Antilarius wanted to throw a stone at him in great\nwrath, but as he had no stone he threw at him the piece of bread-crust, which was left, in\nhis hand.  And taking this the beggar went to his companions, and told them that he had\nreceived alms from Antilarius.  And Antilarius had a dream, and in it he saw himself at the\nJudgment, and certain black men were disputing concerning him, and there were other\nmen there who were white; now their faces were austere, and they said, “We cannot find\nattributed to him any alms except the piece of bread-crust”; and when the speaker cast the\nbread into the scales it balanced exactly all his sins.  When he awoke from his sleep he\ndistributed all his possessions among the poor and he departed to Jerusalem where he sold\nhimself for three dinars, and [he gave away] in alms the price of his sale, and he lived and\nserved like a slave.  And when the slaves of his lord caused him sorrow, a shining man\nappeared unto him, and said unto him, “Sorrow not, for I have received the price of thy\nsale, and behold it is here in my hand.”  When certain men who had come from his city\nrevealed what he had done, he fled secretly and came to the gates of the city, the keeper of\nwhich was deaf and dumb.  When Antilarius said unto him, “Open the gates to me,” there\n\nwent forth from his mouth something which was like unto fire, and the ears of the gate-\nkeeper were opened, and he spoke with his mouth, and he opened the gates to Antilarius\nwho went forth into the desert and died there.   When the people missed him, the\ngatekeeper told them all that had happened, and they marveled at his holiness and at his\nadmirable behavior.\nAnd on this day also died Abba John of Debra Tsege.  This holy man by means of\nexcessive fasting, and prayers, and vigil made his body emaciated, and he became like a\ndried clod of earth.  One day when certain men poured over him a cupful of water, because\nof the excessive dryness of his skin he left only unabsorbed a very small portion of it.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and He gave him a\nbenediction and went up into heaven with great glory.  And our Lord Jesus Christ appeared\nunto his sister “Ira’I also, and He said unto her, “Hearken unto the voice of thy brother,\nand do not transgress his command.”   When she woke from her sleep she trembled\nexceedingly, and she went to her brother and told him how our Lord Jesus Christ had\nappeared unto her, and how He had spoken unto her, and she rejoiced exceedingly; and she\nagree with her brother not to transgress that command.  And they swore to each other that\nthey would go to the land of Egypt, and that they would pour out their blood for the Name\nof our Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom be praise!  When the mother of the blessed ‘Abadir\nknew this thing, she rent her garments, she and her handmaidens, and they came to\n‘Abadir and wept before him, and she adjured him not to become a martyr.  And he swore\nunto her that he would not speak to Diocletian concerning martyrdom, and her heart\nbecame quiet, and she ceased from sorrow, and she did not think that he would go to\nanother place to become a martyr.  And Saint ‘Abadir changed his apparel that night, and\nhe went forth from his house, and he drew water secretly for those who were shut up in the\nprison house, until the dawn came.  And he commanded the keeper of the gate of the city\nnot to tell this matter to anyone whatsoever, and he said unto him, “If thou revealest this\nmatter to anyone I will cut off your hand with the sword.”  After this [our Lord Christ]\nappeared unto him again, and He commanded him to go to Egypt and to become a martyr;\nand straightway saint ‘Abadir rose up, and took his sister ‘Ira’I and they departed to the\nland of Egypt, and they arrived in the city of Alexandria.  And some of the soldiers knew\nhim, and they said unto him, “Thou art our Lord ‘Abadir, the commander-in-chief.”  And\n‘Abadir smiled and said unto them, “Many people tell me this, and I say unto them, I am\nnot ‘Abadir, but only someone like unto him.”  And again in another place some soldiers\nrecognized him, and they said unto him, “Thou art ‘Abadir,” and ‘Abadir said unto them,\n“I certainly am not ‘Abadir.”  Then they went forth from the city of Alexandria and came\nto the city of Great Mesr (Grand Cairo), and they found Saint ‘Abkarazun there, and\n‘Abadir knew ‘Abkarazun and blessed him.  Then he came to the city of Eshmunen, and\nforegathered with Samuel the deacon.  And on the following day Samuel went with them\nto the city of ‘Ensena, and they confessed our Lord Jesus Christ before Arianus, governor\nof Antinoe, and he tortured them severely.  And the holy man ‘Abadir prayed and entreated\nGod to strengthen his faith and the faith of his sister ‘Ira’I during the torturing.  And God\ntook the soul of his sister and carried it to the Jerusalem, which is in the heavens, and she\nsaw the habitation of the martyrs and of the righteous; then He brought her soul back into\nher body.  When the governor was tired of torturing them, he commanded his soldiers to\ncut off their heads with the sword.   And before they cut off their heads Arianus the\ngovernor said unto Saint ‘Abadir, “I adjure thee by thy God to inform me whom thou art,\nand what is thy name, and whence comest thou.”  And ‘Abadir said unto him, “Swear unto\nme that thou wilt not change the decree which thou hast decreed in respect of cutting off\nmy head”; and the governor swore unto him even as the holy man had said.  And the holy\nman answered and said unto him, “I am ‘Abadir, the commander-in-chief of the army.” \nAnd Arianus the governor cried out, saying, “Woe is me, O my lord, it is meet that I\nshould die before thee.  Why didst thou not make me to know that thou wast my lord,\ninstead of hiding thyself from me and permitting me to go so far as to condemn thee to all\nthese severe tortures?”  And Saint ‘Abadir answered and said unto him, “Fear not, for thou\n\nart about to receive a crown of martyrdom.  The emperor will seek for me and will not find\nme, and he will hear that thou hast killed me, and he will punish thee with very great\nseverity, and thou wilt die for the sake of the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And now,\nmake speed to finish our martyrdoms.”   And straightway the governor commanded his\nsoldiers to cut off the heads of ‘Abadir and his sister, and they cut off their heads; and the\nsaints received crowns of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  And [the believers]\nspread out fine apparel, and wrapped up their bodies therein, and Samuel the deacon took\nthem and laid them in his house until the days of the persecution were ended; and he built\na fine church for them, and many signs and wonders took place through their bodies.\nThree salutations to ‘Abadir and his sister.\nAnd on this day also died Sosena.  The father of this holy woman was Chelcias (Helkiah),\nand she was the wife of Joachim, a Jewish nobleman, and one of those who had been\ncarried away captive into Babylon; and all his kinsmen used to come to him to judge their\ncauses.  Now Sosena was exceedingly beautiful and she feared God, and her righteous\nparents taught their daughter the Law of Moses.  And she had a fruit-garden (orchard),\nwhich belonged to her husband, and she used to go at noon and walk about therein.  And in\nthose days there appeared two Rabbans who were hypocrites, such as God spoke of [when\nHe said]  “Sin went forth from Babylon through hypocritical Rabbans who said, Let us\nprotect the people”; and these men frequented the house of Joachim.   When they saw\nSosena walking in the garden they lusted for her, and their hearts went astray and they\nturned their eyes perversely to her, and they remembered not the judgment of God.  Both\nloved her and both wished to lie with her, but neither told to the other what was in his\nheart, for they were afraid to declare their lust.  And they waited the whole day long to find\nher, and one of them acting craftily towards his fellow said, “Let us go to our houses for it\nis the time of evening.”  And they passed out [of the garden] and separated from each other\nand told each other of their desire, and they agreed together upon a time when each would\nfind her [alone], and then they waited for her.  And on a day according to her wont, she\ncame with two of her handmaidens, and she wished to bathe in the garden because she was\nheated and there was no one in the garden.  Now the two old men had hidden themselves\nand they were awaiting her.  And she said unto her handmaidens, “Let them bring to me\nthe oil and the soap wherewith to wash myself, and let them shut the doors.” And when her\nhandmaidens were departed, the two Rabbans rose up, and seized her, and they said unto\nher, “We wish to lie with thee, and if thou refusest we will be witnesses against thee that\nwe found a man with thee.”  And Sosena wept, and said, “I am in affliction in every way: \nIf I do [what ye want] I shall die, and if I do not I cannot be saved.  It is better for me to\nfall into the hand of God than to sin before Him.”  And Sosena uttered a cry at the top of\nher voice, and the Rabbans cried out at her, and one of them ran and opened the doors of\nthe garden.  When the cries were heard by the members of her house they all ran out and\ncame by way of a side door, and they saw what had happened.  And when the Rabbans had\ntold them this matter, all the servants of her house were ashamed, for such a thing had\nnever been heard in connection with Sosena.  On the following day all the people gathered\ntogether to Joachim, and these two Rabbans came with their hearts of violence, and they\ndeclared before all the people, laying their hands upon her head as they did so, “We were\nwalking alone in the garden, and this woman came with two of her handmaidens, and they\nshut the doors of the garden; and she sent her handmaidens away, and there came out a\nyoung man from the place in which he had hidden, and lay with her.  And when we ran\nafter him we could not catch him, for the door was open and he had gone out; we seized\nSosena, but when we asked her she would not tell us his name.”   And the bystanders\nbelieved them because they were Rabbans of the people.  And Sosena who was weeping,\nand whose heart trusted in God, looked up to heaven, and cried out with a loud voice,\nsaying, “O God of the world, Thou knowest that they have laid false information against\nme, and I, behold, I must die, although I have not committed [the sin].”  And God heard\nher petition, and whilst they were carrying her away to kill her, the Spirit of God moved a\ncertain young man called Daniel, and he cried out, saying, “I am innocent of this woman’s\nblood.”  And they said unto him, “What is the meaning of these words?”  And he said unto\nthem, “Are ye fools that ye condemn a daughter of Israel to death without making any\ninvestigation [of the charge against her]?”  And when the council had come back unto the\n\nsynagogue, they had the two Rabbans brought, and set each at a distance from the other. \nAnd Daniel said unto one of them, “By what kind of a tree didst thou see her?”  And he\nsaid “under a sakinon tree,” and the other Rabban said “under a perwon tree.”  And Daniel\ncondemned them by their own words, and the people blessed God Who had saved Sosena,\nthe daughter of Chelcias (Helkiah); and they slew those two Rabbans according to the Law\nof Moses.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated ‘Erani (Irene) the martyr, and ‘Ankuo Maryam,\nand Stephen his son, and Hannah, and Porphyrina, and Luke the monk.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

And he heard that she was in the country of Armenia, “Take care\nof her and send her to me.”  When the virgins heard these words they hid themselves in\nanother city, but certain men went and gave information to the king about them, and\nDertades commanded his soldiers to bring the virgin ‘Arsima to him with great honor; and\nwhen she did not wish to go to him, they dragged her and forced her to come to him. \nWhen Dertades saw the beauty of the holy woman he wanted to defile her virginity, but he\nwas not able to do so.  And he brought her mother Agatha to her to persuade her to be\nsubmissive to the king’s command.  And when her mother came to her she besought her to\nendure patiently, and she comforted her, and she exhorted her, and told her and taught her\nthat she must not forsake her true Bridegroom, Who is the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of\nthe Living God, and that she must not defile her virginity with a filthy pagan and a\nstranger.  When Dertades heard that she had persuaded her daughter to endure patiently, he\ncommanded his soldiers to break the teeth of Agatha her mother.  And God gave to the\nholy woman ‘Arsima power and strength over Dertades, the king, and she hurled him\nbackwards, and dragged him along.  Now Dertades was well known in battle, for he was\nexceedingly strong, and the king was put to shame having been vanquished by the virgin\n‘Arsima; and he commanded his soldiers to cut off the head of Saint ‘Arsima.  And the\nsoldiers came and dragged her away with ropes, and they cut off her head, and tore out her\ntongue, and put out her eyes, and they cut off her limbs and hacked her body to pieces. \nWhen the king awoke from his fall, and his senses returned to him, he repented the killing\nof Saint ‘Arsima; and when he knew that she was dead he commanded his soldiers to slay\nall the [other] virgins.  And the soldiers came and bored holes in the soles of their feet, and\nthey flayed them, and cast them out [to the beasts].  Now there was one of them who was\n\nsick and was lying on her bed, and she cried out to the soldiers and they came to her, and\ncut off her head with one blow.   Thus they all received crowns of martyrdom in the\nkingdom of the heavens.  And they slew all the men who had come with them from the\ncity of Rome, and the number thereof was two and seventy souls; and their bodies were\ncast out into the desert.  After the death of these martyrs a certain devil took possession of\nthe king, and he continued to punish him until Saint Gregory came to him, and prayed over\nhim, and he was healed of his pain immediately, and he believed in Christ.  And they took\nthe bodies of the holy martyrs, and laid them in a holy place until the days of the\npersecution were ended; and a beautiful church was [then] built for them, and signs and\ngreat wonders took place through them.\nSalutation to Arsima.\nSalutation to John the Baptist.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

And it\nwas then as now, and they celebrated the festival regularly.   Praise be unto God, Who\nhonoureth His chosen one with this honor.\nAnd on this day also they commemorate Saint Gregory, Archbishop of the country of\nArmenia.\nAnd on this day also took place the calling of James and John, the sons of Zebedee, and on\nit the martyrs Abba Bula (Pawle), and Maryu, and Petros (Peter), and ‘Asotares [are\ncommemorated].\nSalutation to the great teachers of Debra Maryam, ‘Absadi and ‘Aaron of Galilee.  [This\nparagraph is wanting in the Bodleian MS.]\nAnd on this day also died Abba Shalusi.  This holy man was an athlete, and pretended to\nbe mad, and his fasting and his praying were in secret, and before men he neither prayed\nnor fasted.  Each morning he used to prepare for himself a small amount of food made of\n\nherbs of the desert, and at eventide he ate nothing with the brethren.   Now the\nArchimandrite was Abba Isaac.  And all the monks used to marvel at him, but Abba Isaac\ndid not wish him to continue this habit so that he might not cause himself to fall sick.  One\nday there was about to be a festival in the monastery, and Abba Isaac said unto the monks,\n“Watch him this day and see that he doth not eat before he receiveth the Offering.”  When\nthe time for the meal arrived Abba Shalusi wished to separate himself from them, and the\nmonks prevented him from doing so; and he cried out and said unto them, “Let me alone,\nthat I may not die of hunger, and that my transgression may not be on your heads.”  And\nwhen they would not pay any heed to his cry, he brought out his skull-cap and beat the\nwall of the church with it, saying, “Mary, my Lady, deliver me from these monks.”  And\nthe wall split asunder, and he passed out through the opening, and then the wall joined\nitself again and became as it was before it split open.   And when those who were\nassembled there saw this wonder they cried out, saying, “Kiryalayson” (Kyrie eleeson)\nthree hundred times.   And they found the skullcap that had been thrown out, and they\nplaced it in the church with great honor, and it remained there and worked miracles and\nhealed the sick.  When the archbishop heard about it he wished to take away the skullcap\nso that he might be blessed thereby, and each time he took it away it returned to the\nmonastery.  Now this happened three times.  And this monk after many days like this day\ndied in the desert.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

but he did not want to tell them, and he remained\nsilent and wept bitterly.  When they urged him, and entreated him, to make known to them\nwhat had happened to him, he said unto them, “They carried me off to the Garden of\nDelight, and I saw the habitations of the righteous and the places of torture, and I also saw\nmonks, whom they were carrying to Gahanam, and I also saw many laymen whom they\nwere carrying to the kingdom of heaven.  Why then should I not weep for myself?”  From\nthat day he covered his face with his head-cloth, and said, “I do not want to see the light of\nthis fleeting world, for after it they will take me into everlasting darkness.”  Now this holy\nman devoted himself to the works of the ascetic life; and he strove zealously in the works\nwhich appertained to the soul and the body; and he also commanded his disciples never to\ncease working with their hands, and to give away in charity what was left of the money\nwhereon they lived.  One day there came unto this holy elder a certain lazy monk, and\nwhen he saw this holy elder and his disciples working with their hands, he said unto the\nelder and his disciples, “Ye do then work for the food which is transitory?  But ye should\nwork for the food which abideth for the life everlasting.   For it is written in the Holy\nGospel ‘Mary hath chosen for herself the good part which shall not be taken from her’”\n(Luke x, 42).  When the elder Abba Sylvanus heard him speaking thus, he commanded his\ndisciple, and said unto him, “Give this brother the Book to read, and take him into the\nguest chamber, and shut the door on him, and do not leave with him anything which he can\neat”; and his disciple did as the elder commanded.  When the ninth hour came the elder\nand his disciples prayed and ate their food, but did not summon that monk.  And the time\nof supper having passed, that monk, with his eyes gazing towards the door, waited for\nthem to summon him [to eat].  And being consumed with hunger, he came out from the\ncell, and went to Saint Abba Sylvanus, and he said unto him, “O my father, have the\nbrethren eaten their meal this day?”  And the elder answered and said unto him, “Yea, they\nhave eaten.”  And the monk said unto him, “Why did ye not summon me?”  And the holy\nelder answered and said unto him, “Thou art a spiritually-minded man, and hast no need of\nfood for the body.  Thou hast chosen the good part, but we are men of the body, and we\nrequire material food; for this reason we require the work of our hands.”  And the monk\nknew that he had transgressed with his words, and he bowed low before the holy elder, and\nhe said unto him, “Forgive me, O my father, for I have transgressed.”  And the holy elder\nSylvanus answered, and said unto him, “O my son, we have need of work, just as Martha\nworked, and through Martha, Mary was praised.”   Thus the monk was rebuked by the\nteaching of this father.  And he worked with his hands continually, and he gave alms to the\npoor with what remained over.  And this holy man wrote many discourses (or, homilies)\nand admonitions wherein was help to carry on the spiritual strife.  Having finished his days\nand attained a good old age, God the Most High made him to know the time of his death. \nAnd he called the monks who were nigh unto him, and he was blessed by them, and he\nasked them to remember him at the time of their prayers; and they on their part asked him\nto make mention of them to God.  And he embraced them and died in peace.  Salutation to\nSylvanus, the companion of the angels.\nAnd on this day also the pagan Arabs of Upper Egypt rose up and attacked the monasteries\nin the desert of Scete, and the church of Saint Abba Macarius, and they carried off all the\n\ngoods which were in all the monasteries.  And the monks gathered together, and prayed,\nand made intercession with the holy fathers, and our Lord Jesus Christ drove those pagans\naway, and they turned and fled, and there was none other than God our Lord Jesus Christ\nWho drove them away; and the monks gave thanks unto God, Who shows compassion\nunto them for ever and ever.  Amen.  Salutation unto each of you, O ye sons of Macarius.\nAnd on this day also (according to what is written in an Egyptian book of the city of\nAlexandria, and in an Egyptian book of Upper Egypt) took place the festival in\ncommemoration of the death of Aaron the priest, the brother of Moses the prophet, the son\nof ‘Anbarim (Amram).  What is written in the Book of the Law (i.e. Pentateuch) saith that\nhe died on the third day of the second month of the exodus of the children of Israel from\nEgypt, which is to say on the eighth day of the month of Genbot.  Now the Jewish months\nrevolve, and that [second] month became this month in that year, on the first day of the\nmonth Miyazia.   This righteous man was the brother of Moses the prophet, the son of\n‘Anbarim (Amram), the chief of the prophets, the teacher of the Law, and the brother of\nMary (Miriam), the prophetess; and they were of the tribe of Levi.  And God wrought by\nhis hands many miracles in the land of Egypt.  And God chose him, and his sons, and\nmade them His priest, and gave unto them a title of all the goods, and the offerings of the\nchildren of Israel.  When the sons of Korah rose up against him, God destroyed them, and\nHe commanded the earth and it opened its mouth and swallowed them up.  And having\npleased God the Most High, and fought a good fight, and kept the Law, he departed to\nGod.  Salutation to Aaron.\nAnd on this day also died Saint Matrona, and Saint Justus, and his wife, who became\nmartyrs.  [Omitted in the Bodleian MS.]\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

now his name was called “Elias.”  Then the Jews built the western gate, of\ngreat strength (?), and he made (i.e. set) over the gate a tablet of costly stone on which was\nengraved the name of “Elias.”  Now in his days Jerusalem was filled with stone, and with\nGentiles and Jews.  When the Gentiles saw the Christians coming to Golgotha and praying\nthere, they prevented them, and built there a temple dedicated to the planet Venus, and\nthey would not allow the Christians to pass that site.  Then there came upon this holy man\ngreat tribulation and sorrow, and provocation from the Gentiles, who lived in the city of\nJerusalem, and they beat him often, and dragged (?) him about, and treated him with\ninsult, and afflicted him, and he entreated God that his soul might be received to Him; and\nhe died in peace, having sat upon the Episcopal throne for two years.  Salutation to John,\nthe persecuted, the son of Mary.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father, the pure virgin, Abba Michael, the seventy-first\nArchbishop of the city of Alexandria.  The soul of this father desired what was good, that\nis to say, to put on the apparel of the holy angels, or the garb of the monk, and he became a\nmonk in the church of Saint Abba Macarius, in the desert of Scete.  He lived in the desert\nuntil he was an old man, and he was set over many monks, and he fought a good fight all\nhis days, and he pleased God.  And he labored and did a great work until he reached the\narchiepiscopate, which is Christian ordination in this world, and in the heavenly world,\nwhich is to come.  When Abba Gabriel, the archbishop who preceded him on the throne of\nMark the evangelist, died, there was no Archbishop of Alexandria for four months, and the\nbishops, and priests, and the chief doctors spent a period of three months in searching out,\nand trying to choose the man who was best suited for the office of archbishop.  And after\nmuch searching, and great labor, they chose three desert monks, concerning whom it was\ntestified that they were Orthodox in Faith, and learned.  And they wrote the names of these\nthree men on three small pieces of paper, and they sealed each one of them with wax, and\nlaid them on the altar.  And the bishops, and priests, and monks remained praying for three\ndays and three nights, and they consecrated the Offering; and they entreated God Most\nHigh to set over them a good shepherd and a faithful priest.  And after three days they\ncalled a certain small child and they said unto him, “Take out for us one sealed paper from\namong these four seals.”  And the boy took out that seal under which was the name of this\nholy father Abba Michael, and all men knew that God had chosen him.  And he was of the\nsons of Makedos, of the cell of Darsen, which is in the desert; and all the men cried out,\n“He is worthy, he is worthy, he is worthy”; and straightway they enthroned him\narchbishop.  And he entered upon his office with all the gracious excellence, which befits\nthe archiepiscopacy.  And they chose a scribe to write his epistles to every country, and to\nevery bishop.  And this father used to teach the people, and exhort the sinners to repent of\ntheir sins; and all his flock feared him because they knew that God was with him.  He was\npure in heart and in soul, and he had no desire for any of the dainty meats and delicate\nfoods of this world, and he coveted neither the honor thereof nor its possessions.  And he\nstrove and understood the visiting of the poor and needy, and he gave them what they\n\nasked for their needs, and whatsoever remained after their wants were satisfied he spent in\nbuilding churches.  This father did not hold his office a full year, but lived a little short of\nit, and he died in peace.  Salutation to Michael.\nAnd on this day also died Marke, the poor, the Christian.  This holy man was a native of\nthe city of Antioch, and he had a trusted friend whose name was Guespar, an infidel, and a\nworshipper of idols; and the two men differed about nothing whatsoever except their\nFaith.   One day Marke and this Gufar departed on a pilgrimage to the city of Bagdad\n(Baghdad), and they spent five days in traveling through a desert wherein there was no\nman.  Now Marke the Christian was a rich man, and he had with him thirty pounds of\ngold, and whilst he was on the road he fell sick of a violent disease, which brought him\n[nigh unto] death.  And he forced himself and wrote a document, saying thus:  “From Thy\nservant, the son of Thy handmaiden, I have thirty pounds of gold fastened to the black\nmule and it is Thine, O my Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, Glory be to Thee! In\natonement for my sins, and for my errors, so that Thou mayest give me the kingdom of\nheaven; and it shall not be for my children, my wife and my kinsfolk.”  And he rolled up\nthe paper, and sealed it, and called his friend Guespar, and he made him swear by his gods\nthat he would do for him everything, which he told him.  And when Guespar had sworn, he\nsaid unto him, “When I die do not touch me, but take this paper and the thirty pounds of\ngold with the mule on which it is, and give it to my Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God;\ntake it in thy hand and do not tell my children.”  And Guespar said unto him, “Art thou\nmad, O my friend?  Didst thou not say that Christ, glory be to Him, died, and rose, and\nascended into heaven?  How than can I give it unto Him?”  And Marke said unto him, “Go\nto a church, and when he who belongs to it cometh unto thee, give him the gold from thy\nhand into his.”  And after this when Marke came nearer and nearer to death Guespar sat\ndown some distance from him, and waited for him to die.  And he saw angels coming\ndown to him holding a heart of light, and with them were the righteous, and the martyrs,\nand David singing psalms to his harp; and the Holy Spirit came down in the form of a\nwhite dove, and He went round the body of Marke thrice.  And when the holy soul of\nMarke saw [this] it went forth from his body, and ascended into heaven with great glory. \nAnd then two lions came and buried him.  And Guespar loaded the gold [on the mule] and\ndeparted, marveling at everything, which he had seen to Thaddeus, the steward of the\nchurch, [who did not wish] to receive Guespar the pagan, but he demanded from him the\ngold and the mule.  When the priest said this, Guespar said unto him, “I will give the gold\nand the mule from my hand into the hand of my Lord Jesus Christ [only], as my friend\nmade me swear to do.”  And leading away the mules, he departed to the church.  And the\npriest Thaddeus opened the gates, ad having gone in Guespar laid the gold on the altar; and\nhaving gone out the gates were closed, and he stood there.  And at the time of midnight, he\nheard the sound of thunder inside the church, and light appeared, and suddenly my God\nour Lord Jesus Christ came down with great glory; and with Him were two angels, and He\nsat down upon the altar.  And an angel said unto Guespar, “Come, worship, for this is\nChrist Himself, the Son of God”; and Guespar bowed low and gave Him the paper, saying,\n“I have believed in Thee, my Lord Jesus Christ.”  And Christ ordered the angels to weigh\nthe gold, and there were thirty pounds, and our Lord commanded Guespar to be baptized\nby the priest Thaddeus, and he and all the men of his house were baptized, now they were\nin number seventy-five souls.   And Guespar died in the Faith of Christ.   Salutation to\nMarke who sent his gold to Christ.  Salutation to the idolater Guespar, and also to the men\nof his house who believed through this great miracle.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and her love for this filthy work increased\n[with her years].  And by the Will of God, the Lover of mankind, He showed her the men\nwho wished to go and be blessed at the tomb of our Lord Jesus Christ in the city of\nJerusalem, and the thought stirred in her mind that she would go with them; and she\nembarked in a ship, with many people.  When they were about to set sail, the sailors said\nunto her, “Give us the passage money for the ship,” and as she had not the money with her\nto give them, she gave them her body so that they might take fornication with her in place\nof the ship’s passage money.  When she arrived in Jerusalem, she did the same thing, and\nplayed the whore continually.   When she wished to go in with the rest of the people\nthrough the door of the church of the tomb of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Divine Power\nprevented her from entering.  And it came to pass that when she wished [to fornicate] with\nthe people who were coming [there] the Power of God prevented her from doing so.  And\nwhen she drew nigh, and the Power prevented her from entering the church because of her\nfilthy deeds, she lifted up her eyes to heaven, to God the Merciful, being sad and sorrowful\nin her heart, and she saw above her a picture of our Lady, the holy Virgin Mary, the God-\nbearer.  And she wept before it, and made entreaty unto it, saying, “O intercessor for all\nChristian people, O God-bearer, make a pact with me.  If I can go in and celebrate the\nfestival with all the [other] people, I will do everything which thou commandest me.”  And\nsaying these words she went quickly into the church of the tomb of our Lord Jesus Christ. \nAnd when she had finished the keeping of the feast, she returned quickly to the picture of\nour Lady the holy Virgin Mary, the God-bearer; and she made long prayers before it, and\nwept bitterly, and made entreaties before it that the Virgin would send her where ever she\npleased, so that she might save her soul.  And a voice came out from the picture of our\nLady, the holy Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, saying, “If thou wilt go into the desert of the\nJordan thou wilt find rest and salvation.”  And she accepted the words, and prayed and\nsaluted the picture of our Lady, the holy Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, and then she went\nforth.  When she had gone forth from the church she met a certain man, and he gave her\nthree small coins wherewith she bought bread.  Then she crossed the valley (or, river) of\nthe Jordan, and dwelt in the desert of the Jordan for seven and forty years; and she strove\nstrenuously, and Satan fought against her by means of her love for the impure thing, which\nshe had worked formerly.  And she lived upon the bread, which she had bought for many\ndays, and every two days she used to fast for two days, and every three days for three\ndays, and little by little she ate up her bread.  When the bread was finished she lived upon\nthe herbs in the desert.  When the seven and forty years wherein she had wandered up and\ndown the desert had come to an end, the holy priest Zozimas went out into the desert of\nthe Jordan, in order to complete therein the holy Forty Days’ Fast, according to the custom\nobserved in his monastery--now it was the custom with the monks of his monastery to go\nout each year for the Great Fast (i.e. Lent) into the desert, and to devote themselves to\nsevere ascetic labors, and to fight in the spirit until the end of the Fast.   When Saint\nZozimas had gone out into the desert of the Jordan, he entreated God to show him, that\nwhich would give him consolation.  As he was going along in the desert he saw the holy\nwoman Mary in the distance, and he believed her to be Satan himself.  And having prayed,\nit was shown to him that she was a human being, and he went towards her, and she fled\nfrom him; and he followed her and ran after her to come up to her, but she still fled from\nhim.  Then she called out to him by his name, saying, “O Zozimas, why dost thou want to\n\ntalk to me; throw me a rag that I may cover myself therewith, for I am naked.”  And he\nmarveled exceedingly when she called him by his name, and he threw to her the\nwherewithal to cover herself; and straightway she came to him and bowed before him, and\nhe bowed before her, and they embraced each other, and she asked him to pray for her, for\nhe was a priest.  Then he asked her to tell him the story of her fight, and then she told him\neverything, which had happened to her from the beginning to the end.  Then she asked him\nto come and visit her each year, and to bring with him the Body and Blood of our Lord\nJesus Christ, and he said unto her, “I will.”  When a full year had passed he took some of\nthe holy Body, and the honorable Blood in a cup, and he carried with him figs, and dates,\nand also lentils for soaking in water.  And he came to the bank of the River Jordan, and\nsaw the holy woman coming in the distance, and she was walking towards the River\nJordan; and when she came up to him they embraced each other and prayed.  Then he\nadministered to her the Holy Mysteries, and he brought forth the dates, and the figs, and\nthe lentils, and asked her to accept them from him; but she asked him to come back to her\nin the desert in the following year.  When the second year was ended, and he went to the\nvalley of the Jordan, he found that the holy woman was dead, and lying near her head was\na paper whereon was written, “Bury Mary, the poor woman, in the dust of which she was\ncreated”; and he marveled at the writing.  And he saw near her feet a lion, which was\nguarding her, and whilst he was wondering in his mind with what he should dig her grave,\nthe lion came and dug a grave for her; then the holy man prayed over her and buried her. \nAnd he returned to his monastery and related to the monks the story of the strife of this\nholy woman Mary the Egyptian from the beginning to the end thereof, even as she had\ntold it to him; and they all marveled exceedingly, and they praised the glorious and Most\nHigh God.  And all the days of her life were seven and seventy years.  Salutation to Mary,\nwhose dead body was guarded by a lion in the desert.\nAnd on this day our Lord Jesus Christ appeared to Thomas, the apostle, on the eighth day\nafter His resurrection.  And Thomas saw the marks of the nails which were in His hands\nand feet, and he took his hands and laid them in His Divine side, where the spear had\npierced it, and he said, “My Lord and my God.”  And our Lord said unto him, “Thou hast\nbelieved on Me, because thou hast seen Me; blessed is he who shall believe on Me without\nseeing Me.”  In a commentary on the Gospel it saith that when Thomas the apostle laid his\nhand in our Lord’s side, his hand was burnt with divine fire; and that when he believed in\nHis Godhead his hand was healed of the burn.  Glory be to God, and let us beseech Him to\nhave mercy upon us through the prayers of all His holy apostles and righteous ones,\nforever and ever.  Amen.  Salutation to the chamber wherein Christ showed His pierced\nside, and the hand of Thomas was burnt.\nAnd the fathers have commanded us to celebrate the commemoration of the deaths of our\nfather Adam and our mother Eve on this day.  Before God created this our father Adam He\ncreated the heavens and the earth and all that therein is, and the angels and the archangels. \nAnd having planted for him the Garden of Edom containing every kind of fruit pleasant to\nthe taste, and having furnished it with every desirable thing, He created Adam.  He took\ndust from the centre of the earth, that is to say Golgotha, at the third hour of the day of the\nEve of the Sabbath (Friday), and He created him out of four things, that is to say, water,\nfire, air, and dust.  And He made him in His own image and likeness, and He breathed into\nhis nostrils the breath of life, and He dressed him in the dress of life, and light, and He\nmade him king, and priest, and prophet, and administrator of everything he wished.  Then\nHe brought to him all the beasts, and cattle, and birds of the heavens so that Adam might\nsee them, [and give unto] each of them its name, even as he pronounced them, through the\nHoly Spirit, which was on him.  And God having wished to make for him a companion to\nhelp him, brought upon him slumber, and he slept, and then He took a bone from his side\nand filled [the place thereof] with flesh, and set her before him.  When Adam woke from\nhis sleep he prophesied, and said, “Bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh, assuredly thou\nbe to me my wife”; and he called her name “Hewan” (Eve).  And as Adam was standing\n[there] on the place of Golgotha, he heard the voice of his God, and behold a cloud of light\ntook him up with Eve his wife and carried them into the Garden of Edom, and the voices\nof every rank of the angels, the Cherubim and the Seraphim, went before him praising and\nthanking God because He had done honor to Adam.  And God said unto Adam and Eve,\n\n“Of every tree which is in the Garden eat, but of the tree which is in the middle of the\nGarden eat not, for on the day wherein ye shall eat of it ye shall surely die.”  And Adam\ncontinued to till the Garden, and to eat of the fruit thereof, and he praised [God] with the\nangels.  And when Satan, the Enemy of all good, had fallen from his exalted state and\nhonor, because of his arrogance concerning Adam, and the honor and glory [which God\nhad given him], he went to the place where Eve was, in the form of a serpent, and he\npersuaded her to eat of that tree which God had set apart, and promised to her the nature of\nGod [if she did so].  And having looked at the tree, and seen that the fruit thereof was\ngood, she ate thereof, and made Adam to eat thereof.   And their raiment of light was\nstripped from them, and they knew that they were naked, and they covered their shame\nwith the leaves of the fig tree.  And when God knew their fault, He cursed the serpent, and\nHe made enmity to exist between it and the seed of Eve.  And her also He cursed, saying,\n“In pain conceive and bring forth thy children; and thy turning shall be to thy husband, and\nhe shall serve thee.”  And to Adam He said, “Cursed shall the ground be for thy sake. \nWith the sweat of thy face eat thy bread; dust thou art and to dust thou shalt return.”  And\nhe made for them tunics of hide, and they put them on, and they went forth from the\nGarden of Edom, at the turn of the evening, after seven years of joy and delight.  In the\nmorning, at sunrise, he used to smell the smell of incense, and perfume, and water of\nfrankincense, and aromatic herbs.   And Adam dwelt in the land of Elda and tilled the\nground according to what he had learned in the Garden of Edom, and he knew his wife\nEve and she bore him Kayl (Cain) and after him Abel.  When Kayl (Cain) slew Abel in his\njealousy.  And Adam continued to lament the death of his son for seven (?) years, and then\nSeth was born unto him in exchange for Abel his son, in whom stood his memorial, and\nafter him came many children (?).  When Adam went forth from the Garden, God saw his\ntears and his repentance, and He gave him the promise of a hope of salvation, and He said\nunto him, “In five thousand and five years I will come into the world, and I will be born of\nwhat is in thee, and I will deliver thee in a wide place, and I will redeem thee by My\nCross.”  And Adam took from the Garden gold, and myrrh, and incense, and gave them to\nhis son Seth, and he wrote for him, saying, “In the last days the Son of God shall come,\nand He shall be born of a virgin, and then the Magi shall bring (as) gifts unto Him this\ngold, and myrrh, and incense.”  And this writing after begin handed down from generation\nto generation came to our Lady, the holy Virgin Mary, and she gave it to our father Peter,\nand Peter gave it to Clement.  When our father Adam knew his death was near he called\nhis son Seth, and Seth drew nigh unto him in the Cave of Treasures.  And Adam said unto\nhim, “Make thy children and thy children’s children to come unto me before I die.”  When\nSeth heard the words of his father Adam, he went forth from his presence, with the tears\nflowing down his cheeks, and he gathered together his children, and his children’s\nchildren, and brought them to him.   When Adam saw them he wept because of his\n[approaching] separation from them, and when they saw him weeping they all wept\ntogether before God, and they fell down upon their faces, saying, “How can the earth\ncover thee, and hide thee from our eyes?”  Then our father Adam blessed all his children,\nand he said unto Seth, “O my son, this world is full of weariness; preserve righteousness\nand purity; let us trust in God.  And incline not to the voice of Satan, and his wiles, which\nhe will make apparent to thee.  When I die take my body, and prepare it for burial with\nmyrrh and cassia and stacte, and bury me in the cave of a store-chamber.  And there shall\ncome a water-flood, and it shall drown every created thing, and only eight souls shall be\nleft.  Be thou a protector of thy people.  Watch over them and protect them in the fear of\nGod, and teach them the way of salvation, and take care of them so that they may not be in\nsubjection to Satan, and that he may not destroy them.   Separate thy children and thy\nchildren’s children from the children of Kayl (Cain), and do not let them mix in any way,\nand they shall draw nigh neither to their works nor their fables.”  Then Adam turned to\nSeth his son, and to Eve his wife, and he confided to their care the gold, and the myrrh,\nand the cassia, so that they might bury them with him.  And he said unto them, “In the\ndays wherein the Water-flood shall come, they shall take my body into the ark, with the\ngold, and the myrrh, and the cassia, and shall lay them in the middle of the earth.  After\nmany days [enemies] shall capture this country, and they shall [not] take the gold, and the\nmyrrh, and the cassia, together with the [other] spoil, but they shall be preserved here until\nthe time when the Word of God shall become flesh, when kings shall take them and bring\n\nthem unto Him--gold because of His kingship, and incense because He is God of heaven\nand earth, and the myrrh is the symbol of His Passion.”   And when Adam was nine\nhundred the thirty years old (Genesis v, 5), in the 135th year of the life of Mahalaleel, he\ndied, at the ninth hour of the day, on Friday, the day on which he was created, now the\nhour in which he died was that in which his going forth from Paradise had taken place; at\nthat moment hosts of angels gathered together to his children.  And they prepared his body\nfor burial carefully, and they anointed him with scented unguents of every kind, which are\n[found] in the trees of the Holy Mountain.  And they laid his body facing the east of the\nCave, and they set a lighted lamp before him, and they laid by his side the gold, and the\nmyrrh, and the cassia; and they sealed the doors of the Cave with the seals of Adam and\nEve and Seth.  And Seth and his children continued to minister unto the body of our father\nAdam, until the Water-flood came.  Then Noah took Adam’s body into the ark, and by the\ncommand of God he carried it with him until he brought it to Mount Ararat.  Then Shem\nand Melchisedek, an angel of the Lord guiding them, took it from this place and buried it\nin the “place of a skull”; and Melchisedek continued to minister unto it with incense and\nofferings.   And when the Son of God came, and was born of Adam’s daughter, He\nredeemed Adam by His death, and restored him to his former inheritance, for he was the\nfather of the prophets and apostles, and the father of the saints and martyrs, and through\nhim the Son of God came into the world.  Salutation to Adam, the first man created, and\nsalutation to Eve, a bone of him.\nAnd on this day were born Noah and David, the king, the father of Solomon. \nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and the elder received him and treated him like a son in Christ.  And he taught\nhim philosophy of every kind, and doctrine, and after this he arrayed him in the garb of the\nmonk, and made him a deacon.  And he grew up doing good works, and he increased in\nexcellence, and he was continually praising God, and he read the Scriptures by day and by\nnight.  And whether he was working with his hands, or whether he was eating his food, he\nnever ceased from praising God at all times.  When he had completed five and forty years\nin that monastery, he was made a priest, and he increased his ascetic labors and his\ncontending, and he became the conqueror in every spiritual fight.  And the Enemy and\nAdversary sowed in his heart the evil thought that he was superior by far in respect of\nseverity of his labors to all the other ascetics his contemporaries.  And he said within his\nsoul, “Doth there remain for me to do one work of righteousness and asceticism which I\nhave not done?”  And our Lord Jesus Christ did not abandon him, but He sent an angel to\nhim, and commanded him to go to that monastery which was near the River Jordan.  And\nhe rose up and departed, and he came to that monastery, and he found therein righteous\nelders who were perfect in their contending, and he knew that his ascetic labors were less\nstrenuous than theirs, and that there lived in the world men who were more perfect and\nbetter than he.  And he took up his abode with them in that monastery, and he fought as\nthey fought with them for many years.   And the monks of that monastery were\naccustomed, when the Great Fast of forty days came, to fast in the monastery for the first\nweek of the Holy Fast, and to receive the Holy Mysteries on the First Day of the week. \nAnd on the following day they went out from the monastery singing the 27th Psalm, “The\nLord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear?” to the end.  When they had finished\ntheir coming forth from the monastery, they prayed at the gates of the monastery, and\nembraced each other, and the abbot of the monastery blessed them, and then they\ndispersed themselves in the desert, and each of them carried out his spiritual fight by\nhimself, unseen by his companions.  And if one of them saw that a companion was near\nhim, he fled to another spot, so that he might not see the face of his neighbor.  And Saint\nZozimas used to go out with them each year, and he would wander up and down in the\ndesert, and ask God to reveal to him something, which would give him comfort.  As he\nwas wandering about he found Mary, the Egyptian woman was dwelt in the desert, and he\nlearned from her the manner of the life which she had lived in the world in the days of her\nyouth, and how it came to pass that she entered that desert; and she told him everything\nwhich had happened to her, and all her fight from the beginning to the end thereof.  Then\nshe asked him to visit her.  After one year [he came to her] and gave her the Mysteries. \nAfter this, in the second year, he visited the desert, and found that she was dead; and he\nburied her, and he told the monks of that monastery concerning her strife.  This holy man\nfound it meet to go to the “Country of the Blessed,” and it is he who wrote the account of\nthe dwellers there, and their strivings, and revealed their works, and their righteousness. \nWhen he had completed eight and ninety years, he died in peace.  Of these he lived [five\nand] forty years in the world before he entered the monastery, and for three and fifty years\nhe lived the life of an ascetic, and fought the spiritual fight.  Salutation to Zozimas who\nvisited the Country of the Blessed like Matthew, and described the lives of those who lived\nthere.\nAnd on this day also the righteous men of the company of Isidore, and a child ten months\nold, together with his father and mother, became martyrs.\n\nAnd on this day also there was made manifest a great miracle through our holy father\nAbba Sinuthius (Shenuti), Archbishop of the city of Alexandria.  This man had gone up\ninto the desert of Scete in order to fast the Great Fast in the monastery of Saint Abba\nMacarius with the monks.  And when it was [the time for] the Eight Hosannas, the Arabs\nand Muslims assembled, and came to the desert of Scete to plunder the desert houses and\nmonasteries, and they stood on the rock to the east of the church of Saint Macarius, and\ntheir swords were drawn in their hands, ready to kill men.   And the bishops, [and the\npriests,] and the monks gathered together to him, and they told him what had taken place\nwith the Arabs and Muslims, and they wanted to go forth from the desert before the\nfestival of Easter.  And Sinuthius (Shenuti) said unto them, “As for me, I will not leave the\ndesert until the festival of Easter be finished.”  And when the Fifth Day of the week had\ncome whereon, according to the New Covenant of Joy, our Lord Christ washed the feet of\nHis disciples, the number of the Muslims and the Arabs increased.  When Abba Sinuthius\n(Shenuti) saw the terror of the people, he took up his staff whereon was the figure of the\nCross, and he grasped it and willed to go forth to them, saying, “It is better for me to die\nwith the people of God.”  And the bishops and the monks seized him, and would not let\nhim go out, and he strengthened their hearts and comforted them.  Then he went forth to\nthe Arabs and the Muslims, with his staff in his hand, and when the Muslims saw him they\nturned round and fled as if they were pursued by an army of soldiers; and from that day\nonwards those Muslims never came back to the monks and never did them any harm. \nSalutation to Archbishop Sinuthius (Shenuti), who put to flight Arabs, who were armed\nwith swords, by the figure of the Cross only.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

he was the disciple of Abba ‘Eblo,\nand he continued to minister unto him for five and twenty years.   And he fought so\nstrenuous a fight that at length his whole body dried up, but he retained possession of all\nhis faculties.  And he remained quiet (or, silent) at the times of prayer and the consecration\nof the Offering, and he stood timidly [in the church] with his hands clasped behind him,\nand his head bent; and he wept until the Office of the Offering was ended.  And when he\ncame out from the Offering, he never associated with any man at all during that day, and\nhe never left the door of his house open lest any man should come and visit him.  And\nwhen anyone asked him, saying, “Why dost thou never talk with him who wisheth to talk\nwith thee at the time of prayer, and at the time of the Offering?” he answered and said unto\nhim, “There is a time for everything, as is fitting.”  And when the time of his death drew\nnigh the company of the monks gathered together to him so that they might be blessed by\nhim, and might take refuge in his prayer.  And when they asked him, and said unto him,\n“Why didst thou flee from men?” he answered and said, “I was not fleeing from men but\nfrom Satan.  If a man taketh hold of lighted lamp, and standeth in the wind, will not the\nlight be extinguished?  Even so is it with us when our hearts shine at the time of prayer\nand at the time of the Offering.  When we meet together and hold converse with each other\nour hearts become dark.”   And this holy man having finished his spiritual strife and\npleased God by his strife, and God having willed to give him rest from the toil of this\nfleeting world, he became a little sick and died in peace.  Salutation to Isaac who loved\nascetic labors and prayer, and fled from the face of a man, as from a wild beast.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Gabriel, the seventieth Archbishop of the\ncity of Alexandria, who was named the “son of Taroyka.”  This holy man was a son of one\nof the rich nobles of Mesr (Cairo), and he was appointed deacon in the church of Saint\nMercorius of Egypt.   He was a wise and learned writer, and he wrote many books in\nCoptic and Arabic with his own hand, and he completed the greater part of them, and he\ninterpreted (or, translated) many others; and the bishops, and those who were in authority,\nand the elders of the people chose him to be appointed archbishop.  And there was in the\ndesert of Scete a certain elder, a Syrian, and a man of the Spirit, whose name was Abba\nYosef, and the grace of God was upon him, and he could see by the Holy Spirit, and\ndescribe what was about to take place before it happened.  And the aged monks gathered\ntogether to him, and asked him to make them to know, and reveal to them the answer to\ntheir enquiry, “Who is the best man for this honorable office?”  And Yosef answered and\nsaid unto them, “A certain man who is called Gabriel, the son of Taroyka”; and the monks\ntold this answer to the bishops.  And they all were pleased with it, and they agreed about\nhim, and they seized him and enthroned him archbishop on the 21st day of the month of\nYekatit, in the year of mercy, the eight hundred and fortieth year [of the Era] of the martyrs\n(i.e. A.D. 1124).  And when he departed to the desert of Scete, he added in the prayer of\nthe Creed, which is at the end of the Liturgy of Basil, the words, “and was One with His\nGodhead.”  And the monks of the desert of Scete said unto him, “This is not our custom.” \nThey were afraid that he thought that Christ was . . . and that His Godhead was mingled\nwith His manhood.  And after a great searching out, these words were sanctioned, and\nwhat followeth:   “without separation, and without mixture, and without blending”; and\nthey were well received and are in the Creed to this day.   And this father in his days\nordained very many good things, and he cursed the people who brought the bodies of the\ndead into the inner parts of the churches of Mesr (Cairo), and he cursed all those who had\nconcubines and cast them forth from their houses, and drove them away.  And this father\ndrew up a Canon, and laid down just laws concerning inheritances from dead men, and\n\nother matters, and these ordinances are observed by the Church from many books.  During\nthe days of his rule he appointed three and fifty bishops, and many priests, and he never\ntook a dirham from them.  And at that time the King of Egypt brought tribulation upon\nhim, and demanded money from him by force, and he set seventy spies over him to watch\nhim.  And the scribes, and the men in authority, and the people, knowing that this father\nhad neither taken any money from any man, nor from the moneys of the Church, nor from\nthe [rents of] the lands of the poor, they collected from their own houses three hundred\ndinars in gold and gave them to the king on his behalf.  And as the time of his death drew\nnigh, and God willed to make manifest his righteousness and virtues, he became a little\nsick.  And he saw in a vision many priests and monks coming to him, carrying in their\nhands crosses, and censers, and Books of the Gospel, and they embraced him, and said\nunto him, “We have come unto thee to visit thee, but we will return unto thee after this\nearth is ended [for thee], and we will take thee with us.”  When he awoke he told the\nbishops and the priests who were about him what he had seen, and then he recovered from\nhis illness.  And after the end of a year he became a little sick, and again he saw the priests\nand the monks who had come to him formerly, and they embraced him and he rejoiced\nwith them.  And straightway he delivered his soul into the hand of God, and he died in\npeace; and all the days of his sitting upon the throne of Mark the evangelist were fourteen\nyears.   And in the days of this father the King of Ethiopia commanded Abba Michael,\nsaying, “Set a bishop over the country of Ethiopia”; and the bishop said unto the king, “I\ncannot appoint another bishop without the command of the archbishop.”  And the King of\nEthiopia sent a letter to this father Abba Gabriel the archbishop, asking him concerning\nthis matter, and he also sent a letter to the King of Egypt asking him to command this\nfather [to appoint a bishop].   And this father commanded Abba Michael, Bishop of\nEthiopia, to appoint for him other bishops over and above those, which had been already\nappointed.   And the King of Mesr (Cairo) commanded this father Abba Gabriel to\ncommand Abba Michael, Bishop of Ethiopia, to do everything that the King of Ethiopia\nwished.  And the nobles came in to the King of Mesr (Cairo), and they said unto him, “If\nbishops become many in the country of Ethiopia they will wax bold, and they will appoint\nbishops as they please, and they will never return to thee at all.”  When the King of Mesr\n(Cairo) heard this, he commanded this father archbishop, Abba Gabriel, saying, “Send a\nletter and curse the King of Ethiopia, so that henceforward he may not appoint bishops\nover the country of Ethiopia”; and the archbishop sent a letter as the King of Egypt\ncommanded him.   When that letter reached the King of Ethiopia, suddenly his palace\ncaught fire, and famine and plague broke out in his land, and the rain was held back, and\nwould not fall on the fields, and great tribulation came upon the people, for the king\nrefused [to obey]; and he transgressed the command of God.  Then the King of Ethiopia\nturned to God and repented, and he sent a letter to the King of Mesr (Cairo) asking him to\ncommand this father to send, and release him from this ban.  And this father wrote a letter\nof blessing, and sent it to the King of Ethiopia, and to all the Ethiopians, and blessed\nthem.  When that letter reached the country of Ethiopia God removed His anger from them\nand sent to them His compassion and mercy; and the rain descended upon them, and God\nremoved the famine and the plague and the people rejoiced with great joy.  And this is\nwhat happened in the days of that king.  Salutation to the Patriarch, the son of Torayk, to\nwhose name was added that of the angel Gabriel.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

Then this Alexander sat with Barkisis, the elder, for a period\nof five years, and more, and the holy father Barkisis, the elder, died; and Alexander took\nover his flock in the city of Jerusalem, and he shepherded the people and gave them\nspiritual protection, even as did the apostles.  And Maximus, the infidel governor, seized\nhim, and he inflicted upon him severe tortures of every kind, and then he shut him up in\nprison until he could decide what to do with him.   And God blotted out that wicked\ngovernor quickly, and brought out this father from the prison house.   When Gordianus\nbecame emperor there was quietness, and for a short time he removed tribulation from the\nChristians.  After this he died, and Philip reigned in his stead; now Philip was a believer\nand he believed on the Lord Jesus Christ.  And he set free from the prisons all the believers\nwho had been shut up therein for the Name of Christ, and he paid them great honor.  And\nthis father sat in quietness and peace until Decius rose and killed Philip, and reigned in his\nstead; and he afflicted the Christians exceedingly.  And he seized this father and many of\nthe elders of the Church, and inflicted punishments of every kind upon them, but\nespecially upon this father, whom he beat cruelly and unmercifully with staves, to which\nsharp irons pierced his belly.  Then he commanded [the soldiers] to drag him by his feet to\nthe prison house, and to throw him in there; and they did even as the emperor\ncommanded.  And Alexander lay prostrate in the prison house, but believing on our Lord\nChrist, and he delivered up his soul into the hand of God, and inherited the kingdom of the\nheavens, which is prepared for the saints of God.  Salutation to Alexander who was beaten\nto death, and to Antonius, and Luke.\nAnd on this day God sent Michael the archangel to Jeremiah the prophet, and delivered\nhim from the narrow prison wherein Zedekiah the king had imprisoned him, and Abimelek\nthe Ethiopian, the captain of the royal guard brought him out.  And Straightway Jeremiah\nblessed him, and he (the angel) told him that he should neither see the desolation of\nJerusalem, nor taste the bitterness of captivity and calamity; and this actually came to pass\nfor him.  And he fell asleep for seven and sixty years, and with Michael were wine, and\nfigs, and he gave [them] to Jeremiah the prophet.  And for this reason the doctors of the\nChurch have commanded us to make a festival in honor of the glorious Archangel Michael\n\non the twelfth day of each month.  Salutation to Michael, the angel of the covenant of God,\nand helper of all who are on land and sea, like whom there is no other.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Saint Anthony, Bishop of the city of Tamaw, and\nEusanius (Ausanius).\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Gaius (Fugasyos), and Esdras unto whom John\nthe Baptist appeared.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

He commanded the soldiers to take him to the east of the city, and to cut\noff his head with the sword.  Now Abba ‘Ebsoy was in the prison house, and the angel of\nthe Lord caught him up, and brought him to his brother Peter, and they embraced each\nother, and kissed, and then they prayed to God to bring them to the heavenly Jerusalem. \nAnd behold a voice came unto them from heaven, saying, “Peace be unto you, O ye\nfighters, for ye shall be among the company of heaven, and your bodies shall not be\nseparated from each other upon earth”; and then the angel of the Lord took Abba Peter and\nbrought him back into the prison house.  And the soldiers cut off the head of the mighty\nand victorious Abba Peter, and they hung his body on a tree.  Then Abba ‘Ebsoy asked the\nkeeper of the prison house to let him go away secretly, and having gone he brought the\nbody of Abba Peter, and swathed it with scented cloths, and buried it in a secret place. \nSalutation to Peter of goodly face and form.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

his mother died when he was a child and left\nhim alone with his father.  When he had grown a little, he herded his father’s sheep, and\nhis father married another wife.  In those days there was a great famine, and his father’s\nwife hated him, and only gave him a little bread, and this holy man used to give his food to\nthe shepherds, and fasted the whole day long until the evening; now at that time he was\nfive years old.  When his father knew that his son used to give his food to the shepherds\nand fast all day until the evening, he went to see him.  And this holy man, knowing the\nmatter before his father came to him, tied up three pieces of mud in his cloak, so that his\nfather might think when he saw them that they were three loaves of bread tied up in it. \nAnd when his father came to him, and unrolled the cloak, and found the three pieces of\nmud he thought they were loaves of bread.  And he asked the boy to tell him if he had\ngiven his bread that day to the shepherds or not, and he said, “Yea.”  And he gave his food\nto the shepherds, and many came and heard this; and his father marveled, and glorified\nGod.   When this holy man had grown up he went and became a monk with a certain\nrighteous man whose name was Elias, and he lived with him for many years.  When Abba\nElias died Abba Isaac went to the monastery of Barnug, and he lived with an elder whose\nname was Zacharias, and he devoted himself to the ascetic life, and fought a great spiritual\nfight.  And his father went about in every district, trying to find him.  When his father\ncame to the monastery of Barnug, and found him there, he asked him to return with him,\nand Isaac refused.  And Abba Zacharias said unto him, “Go with thy father, and live with\nhim until he dies”; and the holy man went with his father; and he had been living with his\nfather a few days when his father died.  And all the goods, which his father left, he gave to\nthe poor and needy, and then he built for himself an abode far from the city, and he dwelt\nthere alone, and devoted himself to the ascetic life.   And he fought a great fight, with\nfasting, and prayer, and ceaseless vigils, until he died in peace, and he was buried in his\nabode, and the place was forgotten.  After many years God willed to reveal it, and a lighted\nlamp, which appeared above his grave, was seen by certain men who were reaping; and\nhaving seen this miracle for a space of three days, they marveled exceedingly.  When they\ncame to that place to look at it, the lamp disappeared, and when the story of the saint was\nnoised abroad, and the place had been seen by them, they found the lamp burning above\nhis grave.  Then the saint appeared unto certain believers in a dream, and told them the\nplace where his body was, and they took it up with great honor, and laid it on a camel. \nThen thy set out and journeyed on until they came to the middle of his city Harin, and the\nmiddle of Mesrat; and there the camel knelt down, and would not get up again.  And they\nbeat the camel with many strips, but he would not get up, and they knew that it was by the\nWill of God that he would not move.  And they decided to build a shrine for him there, and\nto lay him in it; and they built a church in his name, and laid his body in it, and through it\nmany signs and wonders took place.   Salutation to Isaac, who made clods of earth to\nappear to be loaves of bread.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Alexander, the nineteenth Archbishop of\nthe city of Alexandria, concerning whom the apostolic Athanasius saith, “My father\nAlexander never read the Gospel sitting down, but he read it standing up with the light in\nfront of him.”  And concerning him he also mentions the following: “The chief widows\ncame to him, and they spoke unto him, saying:  There is with us a certain virgin who fasts\nseven days at a time, but she doeth no work with her hands.  And he said unto them, O my\nsisters, I never fast two days at a time.  I never eat when the sun hath appeared.  I eat in\nmoderation.  And he told them that one should eat in moderation and fast in moderation,\nand work in moderation, in every good matter.”   The parents of this holy man were\n\nChristians.   He grew up in the service of the Church, and he was reared therein, for\nMaximus made him a reader, and Abba Theonas made him a deacon, and Abba Peter made\nhim a priest; and he was pure, and a virgin from his youth.  When the time drew nigh for\nAbba Peter to become a martyr, this holy father Alexander and ‘Akilas went to him when\nhe was in prison, and asked him to remove the excommunication from Arius, for Arius had\nasked them both to ask Abba Peter about him.   When they asked Abba Peter, he\nexcommunicated Arius again in their presence.  And he informed them, saying, “Our Lord\nJesus Christ appeared unto me, ‘Arius hath rent My human nature,’ and He commanded\nme not to receive him again.”   And Abba Peter told them that “Akilas should become\narchbishop after him, and that after ‘Akilas, Alexander should be archbishop.  And he told\nthem this thing before the priests of the Thorah of the city of Alexandria, and he\ncommanded them not to receive Arius, and to have no fellowship with him.  When Abba\nPeter had finished his martyrdom, ‘Arkilas was made archbishop after him, and he\ntransgressed and received Arius, and made him a priest; therefore ‘Arkilas lived only\nseven months and died.  After him this father Alexander was made archbishop, and as soon\nas he had taken his seat, the elders of the people came and asked him to receive Arius, but\nhe refused to do so, and added curses to those, which he had already heaped upon him. \nAnd he said unto them, “Father Peter commanded me and ‘Arkilas not to receive Arius,\nand he told us, saying, “Take heed that thou dost not receive Arius, and thou shalt have no\nfellowship with him.”  And ‘Arkilas having received Arius, God speedily removed him\nfrom his office; and Alexander said, “Nay, I will not receive him.”  And he expelled Arius,\nand the people who believed in his evil Faith.   Then Arius went to the Emperor\nConstantine, and laid an accusation against this holy man, saying, “Alexander hath\nexcommunicated me wrongfully.”   And Constantine assembled the General Council of\nThree Hundred and Eighteen Saints in the city of Nicea.  And this father was the President\nof the Council, and he disputed with Arius and revealed his denial to Christ (or, infidelity)\nin words, which were light in their expression, but weighty in their majesty; and they\nexcommunicated him and would not receive his words.  And Alexander uttered the Faith,\nwhich God spoke, with his own mouth unto all the fathers, and he drew up the Canon, and\nthe Law, and [rules for] right judgment, and these are in the hands of Christians until this\nday.  And he made regulations for the Fast (i.e. Lent), and the festival of Easter, and he\nreturned to his office victorious and joyful.  And he shepherded his flock in grace and in\npeace, and he sat upon the throne of Mark the evangelist for seventeen years, and he died\nin peace.   Salutation to Alexander, President of the Council of Nicea, who made the\nexcommunication of Arius to resound in heaven and upon earth.\nAnd on this day died the holy father Abba Mark, the Second, the forty-ninth Archbishop of\nthe city of Alexandria.  This father was a native of Alexandria, and he was a virgin, and\nchaste, and learned, and honorable, and he was the second Archbishop of Alexandria with\nthe name of Mark.  Abba John made him a deacon, and he performed the duties of that\noffice exceedingly well.   He was an eloquent speaker, and his voice was sweet, and\nbecause of his learning and his knowledge of the Books (the Scriptures) all those who\nheard him rejoiced in him.   Then Abba John made him to live in his house, and he\ndelivered to him the regulation and administration of the archiepiscopate, and he did\nnothing whatsoever without his advice.  And he arrayed him in the garb of the monk, in\nthe monastery of Saint Abba Macarius.  And at the moment when he put on the garb of the\nmonk, a certain righteous man from among the holy fathers came, and spoke unto him\nbefore all the people, saying, “This deacon whose name is John (sic) shall, rightly and\nfittingly, sit upon the throne of his father Mark, the evangelist.”  When the time of the\ndeath of Abba John drew nigh, he spoke unto the bishops, and told them that they must\nmake this father archbishop; and they rejoiced in him, and they appointed him by force,\nand against his wish, after he fled from them to the desert of Scete.  And they sent for him,\nand bound him, and they brought him and enthroned him.  In his days he restored the\nchurches, and rebuilt those that were in a ruinous state, and in his days he removed the\nheresies of the heretics who appeared in his days in the country of Egypt.  And he made a\nchurch for them specially, and they sat therein, and he rebuked and admonished them, and\nhe counted them among the sheep of his flock.   And God made manifest through this\nfather many signs and wonders, and he healed multitudes of sick folk, and he drove out the\n\nfilthy devils which possessed men.  And he said unto one of them, “Understand that this\nwould not have come upon thee unless thou hadst shown irreverence to the Holy\nMysteries. Rise up, without fear, and henceforward guard thyself against the vain word\nwhich would go forth from thy mouth.”  And in his days the Muslim Arabs used to carry\noff many Christians from Rom, and bring them to the city of Alexandria and sell them. \nAnd this father was exceedingly sorrowful about this, and he borrowed money from the\nmonasteries and begged money from believing men, and he bought many Roman\nChristians from the Muslims for three thousand dinars in gold; and he wrote for them bills\nof manumission and set them free.   And he said unto them, “Whosoever among you\nwisheth to depart to his own country I will supply him with what he needeth [for the\nvoyage], and send him off, and whosoever among you wisheth to stay with me, I will look\nafter him and protect him.”  When any of them wished to return to their own country he\ngave them the money necessary for the journey, and had them protected on their way until\nthey reached their own country; and for those who remained with him, he provided wives\nand protected them.  After this he took thought for the Church of our Redeemer in the city\nof Alexandria, and restored it; Satan stirred up a riot in the city, and the church was\nburned, but this father restored it again.  When God willed to give him rest be became a\nlittle sick.  And on Easter Sunday Saint Mark the evangelist appeared unto him, and told\nhim about the everlasting joy which God had prepared for him, and he made known unto\nhim, saying, “After thou hast received the Holy Mysteries thou shalt rest.”  Having awoke\nfrom his sleep he told the bishops who were about him what he had seen, and he\ncommanded them to begin the service of consecration of the Offering, and he himself\nconsecrated and received the Holy Mysteries.  And he said unto them, “I embrace you all\nwith a holy embrace,” and he died in peace straightway.  And all the days, which he sat,\nwere twenty years.  Salutation to Alexander, who ransomed the captive Roman Christians\nfor thirty thousand dinars in gold.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Michael, the fifty-third Archbishop of the\ncity of Alexandria.  This holy father was a righteous man, and a monk, and he was made\nabbot of the church of Saint Abba John of the desert of Scete.  And they seized him against\nhis will, now it was with the greatest difficulty that they seized him and made him\nArchbishop of the city of Alexandria, on the 24th day of the month of Hedar; and he\ndevoted himself to the ascetic life and he ordered his course after the manner of the\nApostles.  When the Great Fast came, the holy man went up to the desert of Scete to keep\nthe Great Fast there, and his spiritual fight and his strenuous asceticism when he was in the\ndesert by himself are remembered.  Before he was made archbishop, he prayed to God\nwith tears and groans, saying, “O God, Thou knowest how much I love to dwell by myself,\nand that I have not strength enough for this office, [to say] nothing about my fitness.  I\nbeseech Thee, because of the greatness of Thy compassion, to take my soul and to give me\nrest in this Fast.”  And God received his petition, and it came to pass that after the Easter\nFestival God called him, and gave him rest.  And the days of his office were two years and\nfive months.  Salutation to Michael, whose soul God took according to his request.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

(7?) years, and that\nHe would send His angels to minister unto him.  Now the emperor was exceedingly sad\nand sorry because of all the many tortures which he was inflicting upon Saint George, and\nbecause the saint would not submit to him.  After this the emperor brought to him a great\nand powerful magician whose name was Athanasius, and he concocted a cup full of\npoison, and gave it to that saint to drink, and he thought that he would die as soon as he\nhad drunk it.  When Saint George had drunk the cup, which was full of poison, he received\nno injury whatsoever; and the magician believed on our Lord Jesus Christ, and became a\nmartyr.  And the emperor had an instrument brought wherein were teeth like a saw, and he\ncommanded his soldiers to saw the saint in it, and when they had sawn him, he delivered\nup his soul; but our Lord Jesus Christ raised him up, and the saint returned to the city. \nWhen the people saw this, many of them believed on our Lord Jesus Christ, and they\nreceived crowns of martyrdom; and they were in number thirty thousand and seven\nhundred souls.   When Saint George stood before the Emperor Dodyanos, in the place\nwhere the kings assembled, now the kings were sitting upon seventy thrones, the emperor\nsaid unto him, “We wish thee to make these thrones whereon we are now sitting to put\nforth leaves, and bear fruit.”  And Saint George prayed to God concerning these thrones,\nand they put forth leaves and bore fruit straightway.  And after this they took Saint George,\nand boiled him in a brass cauldron, and then threw him out into the desert, but God\nrestored his soul to his body, and raised him up again; and the saint returned to the kings,\npreached the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ openly.  And they all marveled and said unto\nhim, “If thou wilt raise the dead we shall know that thy God is God indeed, and we will\nbelieve.”  And Saint George prayed to God, and he raised up for them from a cave very\nmany dead people, both men and women and young people.   And these preached the\nName of our Lord Jesus Christ, and told the people about Gahanam, and the Judgment (or,\npunishment); and after this they returned to their graves, and died.   And when those\ninfidels who were contending against him, and resisting him, saw this they said, “These\ncreatures which thou hast raised up are unclean spirits; they are Satanic spirits, and not\nmen.”  And because of their great sadness and sorrow for Saint George, and the tortures\nwhich he was condemned by them to suffer, and in order that he might submit to them,\nthey committed him to the care of a poor beggar woman.  And when the poor woman went\nout to beg for bread the angel of the Lord brought him a table whereon there were all kinds\nof good food.  And there was in the house of that woman a piece of dry wood, and Saint\nGeorge prayed to God, and that wood germinated, and put forth leaves, and it became a\ntall tree with long branches and much foliage.  And when the poor widow came and saw\nthat great miracle, and how that tree had shot up, and the table, she marveled, and she\n\nbrought her son who was blind, and deaf, and dumb, and a paralytic, and asked the saint to\nheal him for her.  And he told her the way to God, and she believed on our Lord Jesus\nChrist.  And the saint made the sign of the Cross over the face of the child and he saw\nstraightway.  And Saint George said unto her, “I will that the next time he may be able to\nhear, and to walk and to speak.”  And the emperor passed through the city, and saw that\ntree, and he marveled, and asked questions concerning it.  And they told him, saying, “This\ntree is in the house of the widow wherein Saint Gorge dwelleth.”  And the emperor having\nremembered Saint George had him brought to him, and he commanded his soldiers to beat\nhim with very many stripes, and they beat him, and crushed his feet, and he died for the\nthird time, and they cast [his body] outside the city; but God raised him up and he returned\nto the kings.  When the Emperor saw him, he marveled, and was frightened, because of all\nthe tortures to which he had subjected the saint, and he began to speak him fair and he\npromised to give him his daughter in marriage and to make him the second in the kingdom\n[if he would deny Christ].   Then the saint made a mock of him, and promised him,\nuntruthfully, that he would offer incense to his gods.   And the emperor rejoiced, and\nthought that the saint would do so actually, and he ran to him, and kissed his head, and\nbrought him into the royal palace.   And the saint rose up to pray, and he prayed, and\nrepeated a psalm of David, and the empress, the wife of the emperor, kissed him, and\nasked him to explain to her what he had read.  And he began to make her to know and to\nunderstand the matter from the time when God created the world, to the Incarnation of our\nLord Jesus Christ; and his words entered her heart and she believed on our Lord Jesus\nChrist.  And on the following day a herald went round calling upon all the men of the city\nto gather together in order to see Saint George make an offering of incense to the gods. \nAnd when the widow heard this, she was exceedingly sorry, and she went out with the\nmultitude to see Saint George make an offering of incense to the idols.  And when the saint\nsaw her he rejoiced, and said unto her son, “Go to Apollo, and command him to come\nhither to me in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ”; and the widow’s son was healed\nstraightway, and he walked and talked, and he went to the idol, and told him what Saint\nGeorge had told him to say.  And he drove out the Satan that foul spirit, which dwelt in the\nidol, and brought it to Saint George.  And the idol confessed before all the people, saying,\n“I am not God, but a creature that leadeth men into error.”  And the saint commanded the\nearth to swallow him up, and straightway the earth swallowed that deceiver.  When the\nemperor saw this, he and all those who were with him were ashamed.  And being filled\nwith fury and wrath against Saint George, he came to the empress his wife, and she said\nunto him, “Did I not tell thee not to oppose the Galilean?   Their God is strong and\nmighty.”  And the emperor was exceedingly wroth with her, for he knew that Saint George\nhad brought her into the True Faith.  And he commanded his soldiers to drag her outside\nthe city, and to cut up her body with a saw, [and they did so,] and she received the crown\nof martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.   Then straightway the kings were afraid\nbecause of Saint George, and they advised the Emperor Dodyanos to write the order for\nthe soldiers to cut off his head with the sword, so that he might have rest from Saint\nGeorge, the mighty one, the conqueror, rejoiced exceedingly.  And he entreated our Lord\nJesus Christ to bring down fire from heaven and destroy the seventy kings, so that they\nmight cease from inflicting tribulation upon the Church.  And straightway fire came down\nfrom heaven, and burnt up the seventy kings and all their soldiers.  Then our Lord Jesus\nChrist appeared unto Saint George and made many covenants with him.  And he said unto\nhim, “Whosoever shall commemorate thee upon earth I will destroy all his sins. \nWhosoever is in tribulation, whether by sea or on land, or is sick, and entreateth Me in thy\nname, I will deliver him quickly from his tribulation”; having said this He went up into\nheaven.  After this the saint bowed his neck, and they cut off his holy head with the sword,\nand he received three everlasting crowns of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens. \nAnd four of his believing slaves took the body of Saint George, and wrapped it up in his\napparel, and took it into the city of Leda, and they built a beautiful church, and laid his\nbody therein, and countless miracles were wrought there.  Salutation to thee, O George,\nthe root of thousands of martyrs.  Salutation to the ninety men and thirty-seven women\nwho, when they saw the hidden glory of the heavens revealed at the martyrdom of Saint\nGeorge, became martyrs.\n\nAnd on this day also died Roko.  This holy man was such a strenuous fighter in the spirit\nthat he made signs and miracles manifest.  One day the sickness of the plague smote him,\nand he prayed to God with abundant tears, and showed Him his sores.  And our Lord Jesus\nChrist appeared unto him, sitting upon a cloud of heaven, and He stood up before him and\nsaid unto him, “Fear not, O My beloved Roko, behold I have come unto thee to heal thee\nof thy sickness, and to establish with thee a covenant that all those who shall pray unto Me\nin thy name, saying, ‘Jesus Christ, the God of Roko, deliver me for I am afflicted,’ shall be\nfree from the sickness of the plague, and it shall not come upon them.”  After He had said\nthis unto him, our Lord Jesus Christ went up into heaven.  And the holy man lived in strict\ndevotion to the ascetic life for many [years], and he died in peace.  Salutation to Roko, the\nchosen fighter.\nSalutation to Stephana, a friend of Victor the martyr.  [Omitted in the Bodleian MS.]\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and the infidel emperor commanded that governor not to leave [alive] anyone who\nmentioned the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And they told him about the fight of this\nholy man Sana, and informed him that he was a captain of soldiers, and told him that he\nhad been tortured severely, and would not turn from his counsel.   And the governor\ncommanded his soldiers to cut off his holy head, [and they did so,] and he received the\ncrown of life.  And his mother saw angels of light taking his soul, and carrying it up to\nheaven, and she said she had seen this when Isidore was martyred.  Then they took the\nbody of Saint Sana, and swathed it for burial, and laid it with the body of Saint Isidore, his\nfriend; and their bodies remain in the city of Samnud, and the people thereof keep a great\nfeast in their honor.  And many signs and wonders appear through them to those who go to\nthem in faith.  Salutation to Sana and Isidore.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Sanutya (Shenuti), the fifty-fifth\nArchbishop of the city of Alexandria.  This holy and spiritual father was a monk from his\nearly years in the church of Saint Macarius, in the desert of Scete, and he advanced in\ngood works as he became older, and his excellences increased, and he devoted himself to\nthe ascetic life, and fought a good fight.  And he was appointed abbot in the house of Saint\nAbba Macarius, and the bishops and all the people chose him, and appointed him\nArchbishop of the city of Alexandria.  And great tribulation and very much sorrow came\nupon him during all the days of his office, and the Muslim kings afflicted him, and they\nseized him and bound him in fetters; and they demanded money from him, but he had\nnothing whatsoever to give them.   And God performed through him many signs and\nwonders and he healed many sick folk of grievous sicknesses, and he cast out Satans from\nmen.  And through his prayer God sent down very much rain upon the men of the country\nof Mareotis, who remained in a state of severe famine for ten years through want of rain;\nfor the wells in the country had dried up and the streams and they well-nigh died of thirst. \nWhen this father came to them to celebrate a festival in the church of Saint Abba Minas,\nthe martyr, all the men of the city gathered together to him and told him how much they\nwere suffering through want of water, and he comforted them and encouraged them to be\npatient.  When this father had ended the Liturgy he entreated God to have mercy upon His\ncreation, and to teach them.  When the time of sunset arrived the rain began to fall in large\ndrops, and then ceased.   And this father said, “O my Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom\nbelongeth glory, O Master, if Thou wishest to teach Thy people, and to show compassion\nunto them with the riches of Thy compassion, and the abundance of Thy mercies, let them\nbe filled and satisfied with Thy mercy, and with Thy blessing, in Thy good pleasure.” \nHaving said this he went into his bed-chamber to pray the prayer for sleep, and then he\nasked God to remember His people, and to show mercy upon them.  And when he finished\nhis prayer, there came mighty thunders and lightning, and the rain descended like a flood,\nand filled all the holes in the ground, and the gardens, and the wells and the grounds round\nabout them.   He remained three years in that land and was there during three years of\nfamine.  On another occasion the Arabs of Upper Egypt assembled, and came to the desert\nof Scete, and they surrounded the monasteries, and wished to kill all the monks who dwelt\nin them, and to plunder the monasteries.  And this holy father took his own cross, and went\nout against them, and when they saw the cross in his hand, they turned backwards and did\nno harm whatsoever.   And this father expelled all infidelity from his country by his\nlearning, and also from his flock.  Now at that time there were men who said that He Who\n\nsuffered for us was only a man and not God.  And this father wrote a letter and sent it\nduring the days of the Great holy Fast (i.e. Lent) to all cities, and in it he spoke thus:  “God\nthe Word suffered for us in His Body, and His Divine Nature was not separated from His\nhuman nature, not for an hour, nay, not for the twinkling of an eye.  These two Natures\nwere one from the beginning, and they were not separated in any way whatsoever by any\noperation; and at the time of His Passion and Death they were not separated.”  When this\nletter was read in all the cities, all the Christians therein rejoiced with a great joy.  And\nthere also appeared certain accursed men who said, now their tongues ought to be cut out!\nthat His Divine Nature died; these were the men of the city of Balyana, and their bishops. \nWhen this father heard the report of them he was very sad, and he wrote other letters\nwherein he said, “The Nature of God, the Word, is unknowable, and intangible, and\nimpassable, and suffering can only enter the human nature which God the Word took and\nmade one with His Godhead, without separation, and without mingling, and without\nchange.”   And he also said therein, “We do not separate God the Word from our flesh\nwhich suffered, but we believe that He was One at the time of His Passion, and likewise\nwe also believe that His Godhead neither suffered nor died, but that He suffered, and died\nin the flesh, only without separation of His Godhead.”   When his letters reached these\nmen, and they had read them, they turned from their error, and they believed in their Faith\nin righteousness and integrity.  And their bishops came and confessed before our father, the\narchbishop, the True and Right Faith, and they entreated our father Archbishop Sanutya\n(Shenuti), saying, “Forgive us our sin and error.”  And this father commanded them to bow\ndown before all the bishops, and priests, and people, and to say unto them, “Forgive us, for\nwe have sinned and gone astray, for it was Satan who led us into error.”  And they did as\nthe archbishop commanded them, and he forgave them their sins.  And this father thought\nmuch about the churches, and their buildings, and the places wherein pilgrims sojourned,\nand what moneys were left him he gave to the poor and needy; and he followed a good\ncourse of life and pleased God.  And the days of his office were fifteen years, and he died\nin peace.  Salutation to the mighty Archbishop who drove away the Enemy by the Cross\nwhich was in his hand.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated the consecration of Dabra Sina, and Abba Yasdera\nof Sina.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and this thing was ever in his mind.  And after this the emperor sent him to the\ncountry of Nicomedia, and he sent to him an edict ordering him to restore the worship of\nidols; when the saint saw this he sorrowed exceedingly.  Then he sent and brought a priest,\nand he learned from him the doctrine of the Church, and the priest baptized him with\nChristian baptism.  After this he returned to the country of Antioch, where he found that\nhis sister had given birth to a child, whose creation (or, nature) had been changed by a\nSatan.  She had given birth to a daughter, whom she had killed, and whose blood she had\ndrunk, for there dwelt in her a Satan, who, by his magic, could take the form of a bird or\nserpent.  When a child was born to any of the natives of the city, the mother used to go\ndown, and kill him by magic and drink his blood.  And when Saint Susenyos saw this, he\ntook his spear in his hand, and killed his sister and her child also, for he was the son of\nSatan; and he killed her husband, and her husband’s father, for they were magicians, and\nthey used to inflict sicknesses on a man and kill him.  After this he returned to Nicomedia,\nand he came to that priest who had baptized him with Christian baptism, and told him\neverything that had happened to him.  When he returned to his city, and his father knew it,\nhe wanted to kill him, and he accused him to the emperor [of being a Christian].  At that\ntime Saint Susenyos went to the emperor in the house of his idols, and he commanded the\nidols, by the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, to descend into Sheol; and straightway the\nearth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up.  And the story of how Saint Susenyos\nhad destroyed their idols was noised abroad, and again his father made accusations against\nhim before the emperor.   And the emperor was wroth with him, and commanded his\nsoldiers to torture him with severe tortures.  And they beat him, and smote him with brass\nrods, and they broke him on the wheel, and they crushed him with the instruments\nwherewith grain is crushed, and they dragged him through the city.  And God strengthened\nhim, and enabled him to endure all these tortures, and the angel of the Lord visited him at\nall times, and strengthened him and healed his wounds, and raised him up whole and\nuninjured.  And many men, who believed on our Lord Jesus Christ through him, became\nmartyrs.  When the emperor was tired he said to one of his men, “Behold, command them\nto cut off his holy head with the sword,” [and they cut it off,] and he received the crown of\nmartyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  And the number of those who became martyrs,\nduring the time they were torturing the saint, was eleven hundred and ninety.  Salutation to\nSusenyos, the son of Su’E Peter, and salutation to the eleven hundred and ninety martyrs\nof the company of Susenyos.\nAnd on this day also John, the son of a carpenter, became a martyr.  This holy man was a\nnative of the city of Nineveh, and his father was a maker of wooden images, and a\nworshipper of idols; his mother was a Christian.  Lacking a son she prayed to God, and she\nbrought forth this saint, and called his name “John” in secret.  When he was eight years of\nage, he helped his father, who bought wooden figures for his son to carve.  One day as he\nwas going about buying idols, the angel of the Lord met him, and told him that idols were\nthe abode of Satan, and commanded him to cast them from his hands; and he taught him\nthe Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And Saint John returned to his father and said unto\nhim, “There is no god but God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth; I will not worship\nthe work of men’s hands.”  When his father heard this, he tied him up in the prison house. \nAnd his mother came and made his heart strong to shed his blood for the Name of our\nLord Jesus Christ.  Then the people of the city came to persuade him with their words, and\nthey said unto him, “O boy, why dost thou forsake thy father’s gods?”  And Saint John said\nunto them, “I will not worship the work of men’s hands, for [idols] are the abodes of filthy\n\ndevils.”  When his father heard his words he took up his saw, and cut off his son’s head,\nbut the young man did not fall down, and he stood upright on his feet, and was baptized\nwith his own blood.  And his mother came and took [his body, and she said], “O my Lord\nJesus Christ, for Whom praise is meet, receive Thou from me this offering, O Thou Who\ndidst accept the offering of Abel in the field.”  And Satan entered the heart of his father\nand made him mad, and his wife took him, and brought him to the grave of her son, and\nprayed for him.  And Saint John came by night, and pierced his father with a spear, and\nSatan went out of him, and then he believed and was baptized in the Name of the Father\nand the Son and the Holy Ghost.  Salutation to John of Nineveh, who was a lamp which\ndispelled the dense darkness of sin.\nAnd on this day also were martyred the saints Sebbidoras, and Abba Serga, and Dereys\n(Dirayes), and Says.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and his opinion, and his word, in respect of the worship of idols, was one with\nthose of the Emperor Diocletian.  And the name of the blessed woman, his mother, was\nMartha, and she was a Christian.  When Saint Victor grew up, he was near the emperor,\nand his rank was the third in the royal palace.  At that time his days were ten years.  And\nhe rejected this world, and the glory thereof.  He ate no flesh, and drank no wine, he fasted\ncontinually, he prayed many prayers without ceasing by day and by night, he visited those\nwho were in prison, and he gave alms to the poor and needy.  And when they killed Saint\nTheodada, the mother of the Saints Cosmas and Damianus, no one dared to go near her\nthrough fear of the emperor.   And Saint Victor came, and carried away her body, and\nburied it, and was unafraid; and he rebuked his father on several occasions for idolatry. \nAnd his father laid information against him before the emperor.  When Saint Victor was\nbrought before the emperor, he unfastened his military girdle, and threw it in the face of\nthe emperor, saying, “Take this gift, which thou didst give me,” and he uttered\nblasphemies against the emperor, and against his idols.   And Hermanos (Romanus)\ncounseled the emperor, and told him to send Victor to the city of Alexandria, to the\ngovernor Herminius, so that he might torture him severely.  And they brought out the holy\nman and set a bridle (i.e. a gag) in his mouth, and his mother bade him farewell with many\ntears.  And he commanded his mother about the poor, and the needy, and the widows, and\nthe orphans, telling her to visit them, and to give them what they needed.  And when he\narrived in Alexandria, Herminius, the governor, tortured him very severely.  And the angel\nof the Lord appeared, and took his soul, and carried it up into heaven, and showed him the\nabode of the beings of light; and [then] his soul returned to his body again.   And the\ngovernor inflicted further tortures upon him by means of boiling oil and pitch.  After this\nhe had him laid upon an iron bed, and had a fire lighted under him, and then he had him\ncast into the furnace which heated the baths [of the city]; and he inflicted upon him every\nkind of torture.  And God strengthened him, and made him to endure, and He sent His\nangel unto him to heal his wounds.  And after this the governor sent Saint Victor to the\ncity, the name of which is Antoine, where he was tortured severely, and they cut out his\ntongue, and drove red-hot iron instruments through his sides; but God gave him strength\nand enabled him to endure.  And after this they imprisoned him in a desert fortress, so that\nhe might die.  Now Saint Victor knew the craft of the carpenter, and he made tools and\nsold them; with a part of the price he fed himself sparingly, and the rest he gave to the poor\nand needy.  And a certain governor came, and took up his abode near that fortress, and the\npeople told him the story of Saint Victor, how that he was the son of Hermanos\n(Romanus), the captain of the imperial army of Antioch.   And the governor had him\nbrought to him, and he urged him greatly [to deny Christ], but he would not turn and he\nwould not obey his behest.  And the governor commanded his soldiers to torture him, and\nthey tortured him severely.  They tore out his tongue by its roots, they beat his mouth, they\nhung him up head downwards, and suspended heavy stones from his hands; and after this\nthey threw him into an oven which had been made red-hot, they poured boiling pitch and\noil over him, they pounded him with pounding instruments, and they made his face to\nsmart and sting with acid and dust, and they put salt in his eyes; and after this they brought\nhim out and hung him up head downwards.  And our Lord Jesus Christ strengthened him,\nand enabled him to endure, and restored to him his members.  And there was a certain\nmaiden, whose days were fifteen years, and who saw Saint Victor from the window of her\nhouse whilst they were torturing him, and she also saw angels, with crowns in their hands,\nand they were placing them on the head of Saint Victor.  And she informed the people\nwhat she had seen, and they marveled exceedingly, and many of them believed on our\nLord Jesus Christ, and became martyrs.  And that maiden believed on the Name of our\n\nLord Jesus Christ, and [confessed her belief] before the governor, and he commanded his\nsoldiers to cut off her head; [and they did so,] and she received the crown of martyrdom. \nAfter this the governor commanded them to cut off the holy head of Saint Victor with the\nsword, [and they did so,] and he received the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the\nheavens.  And certain believing men took the body of the saint and wrapped it in linen and\nin beautiful and costly stuffs and they laid it in a pure place until Martha came from the\ncity of Antioch, and built a beautiful church for it.  And she laid his body therein, and\nthrough it great signs and wonders took place.  Two-fold salutation to Victor and salutation\nto those who associated themselves with him in his martyrdom, and who themselves\nbecame martyrs.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and they demanded money from him, but he had\nnothing whatsoever to give them.   And God performed through him many signs and\nwonders and he healed many sick folk of grievous sicknesses, and he cast out Satans from\nmen.  And through his prayer God sent down very much rain upon the men of the country\nof Mareotis, who remained in a state of severe famine for ten years through want of rain;\nfor the wells in the country had dried up and the streams and they well-nigh died of thirst. \nWhen this father came to them to celebrate a festival in the church of Saint Abba Minas,\nthe martyr, all the men of the city gathered together to him and told him how much they\nwere suffering through want of water, and he comforted them and encouraged them to be\npatient.  When this father had ended the Liturgy he entreated God to have mercy upon His\ncreation, and to teach them.  When the time of sunset arrived the rain began to fall in large\ndrops, and then ceased.   And this father said, “O my Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom\nbelongeth glory, O Master, if Thou wishest to teach Thy people, and to show compassion\nunto them with the riches of Thy compassion, and the abundance of Thy mercies, let them\nbe filled and satisfied with Thy mercy, and with Thy blessing, in Thy good pleasure.” \nHaving said this he went into his bed-chamber to pray the prayer for sleep, and then he\nasked God to remember His people, and to show mercy upon them.  And when he finished\nhis prayer, there came mighty thunders and lightning, and the rain descended like a flood,\nand filled all the holes in the ground, and the gardens, and the wells and the grounds round\nabout them.   He remained three years in that land and was there during three years of\nfamine.  On another occasion the Arabs of Upper Egypt assembled, and came to the desert\nof Scete, and they surrounded the monasteries, and wished to kill all the monks who dwelt\nin them, and to plunder the monasteries.  And this holy father took his own cross, and went\nout against them, and when they saw the cross in his hand, they turned backwards and did\nno harm whatsoever.   And this father expelled all infidelity from his country by his\nlearning, and also from his flock.  Now at that time there were men who said that He Who\n\nsuffered for us was only a man and not God.  And this father wrote a letter and sent it\nduring the days of the Great holy Fast (i.e. Lent) to all cities, and in it he spoke thus:  “God\nthe Word suffered for us in His Body, and His Divine Nature was not separated from His\nhuman nature, not for an hour, nay, not for the twinkling of an eye.  These two Natures\nwere one from the beginning, and they were not separated in any way whatsoever by any\noperation;

and when he saw tribulation come upon them, and scourging, and disgrace in the\ncountry of Pamphylia, he forsook them and returned to Jerusalem.  When the Apostles\nreturned to Jerusalem, and held converse together concerning the reception of the Gentiles\ninto the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, and considered how God had worked signs and\nwonders by their hands, he was sorry, and repented, because he was one of them.  And he\nsought to go with them, but Saint Paul did not wish to take him because he had forsaken\nthem, but he took Barnabas, and Saint Mark went to Saint Peter in the city of Rome, and\nbecame his disciple.   And there he wrote for himself his Gospel, and Saint Peter\ninterpreted (or, translated) it, and preached it in Rome; and after this he walked in the\ncommandments of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in the commandments of the holy apostles in\nthe city of Alexandria, and he preached therein the preaching of the Holy Gospel.  And he\nalso preached in the country of Africa, and Berka, and Pentapolis [the Five Western cities\nin North Africa].  As he was coming to the city of Alexandria, the latchet of his sandal\nbroke off from his foot, and when he reached the gates thereof he found a certain sandal-\nmaker there, and the saint gave him his sandal to repair.  As he was sewing the sandal, the\nawl pierced his finger, and blood ran down from it, and he said in the Greek language,\n“Estaas,” which is, being interpreted, “one God”.  And Saint Mark said unto him, “Dost\nthou know God?”  And he said unto him, “Certainly not.  We utter His Name only, but we\ndo not know Him.”  And Saint Mark began to talk to him about the beginning when God\ncreated the heavens and the earth, and how the transgression of our father Adam took\nplace, and of the coming of the Flood, and how God sent Moses, who brought the children\nof Israel out of Egypt, and gave them the Law, and how the children of Israel were carried\ncaptives to the city of Babylon from Jerusalem, and how our Lord Jesus Christ became\nman, and how the prophets foretold His coming.  And then the saint spat in the dust, and\nsmeared it on the hands of the sandal-maker and he was healed straightway.  Now the\nname of the sandal-maker was “Anianus,” and he took Saint Mark to his house and he\nbrought to him his sons and kinsfolk, and Saint Mark the apostle admonished them all, and\ntaught them, and baptized them with Christian baptism in the Name of the Father and the\nSon and the Holy Ghost.  And when the believers on our Lord Jesus Christ increased, and\nthe men of the city heard the report of Saint Mark, they gathered together, and wished to\nkill them.  And Saint Mark appointed Anianus archbishop, and he made his sons priests\nand deacons, and he went out to the city of Berka and to Pentapolis and preached in them,\nand strengthened the people in the Faith.  And he remained with them two years, and he\nappointed bishops, and priests, and deacons over them, and then he returned to the city of\nAlexandria where the believers had increased in number.  And he built a church in a place,\nwhich is known as the “Field of Bulls,” on the shore of the sea; and the infidels sought for\nSaint Mark to kill him.  And he visited Pentapolis very frequently, and when he came back\n\nhe entered the city of Alexandria secretly.  One year he returned from Pentapolis and came\ninto the church on the day of the festival of the Resurrection, which took place on the\nnineteenth day of the month of Miyazya, and all the people were round about him.  And\nthe infidels came into the church, and threw cords round the neck of Saint Mark, and\ndragged him about through the city, and they said also, “Let us drag him to the church in\nthe ‘Field of the Bulls.’”  And the blood of the saint was in every street of the city, and the\ndistrict round about it, and the ends thereof.  When the night came, our Lord Jesus Christ\nappeared unto him in the form which He had when He was with the Apostles, and He gave\nhim [the kiss of] peace, and strengthened him, and made a covenant with him, saying,\n“Behold, thou art the equal of thy brethren the Apostles”; and his soul rejoiced and was\nglad.  And on the following day they put cords about his neck, and dragged him through\nthe villages, and at the end of the day he delivered up his soul; and the infidels lighted a\nlarge fire and threw his body into it.  And by the good pleasure of our Lord Jesus Christ\nthere came darkness, and a cold wind, and the sun hid his light, and there was lightning\nand thunder and rain and hail, and the infidels fled before them.  And certain believing\nmen came and took the body of Saint Mark, which was whole and had suffered no injury,\nand they wrapped it up for burial in fine cloths, and laid it in a secret place.  Salutation to\nMark, whose body was crowned with lightning, and rain, and hail.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and Diocletian urged\nhim, with many persuasive words, [to worship idols,] but he would not hearken unto him. \nAnd after this Justus urged the saint, until Diocletian wrote the order, and sent it to Justus,\nand his wife Theoklera, and his son ‘Aboli, who is commemorated this day, and he sent\nthem to the country of Egypt, to Herminius, governor of the city of Alexandria, and he said\nin his letter, “When Justus, and his wife, and his son ‘Aboli arrive, persuade them to offer\nsacrifice to the gods, and if they will not do so, separate them from each other, and send\nthem each alone into the city.”  And that night our Lord Jesus Christ appeared unto Justus\nand his wife, and his son, and comforted them and encouraged them, and He told them\nwhat was going to happen to them, and He promised [to receive] them in His heavenly\nabode.  And when they arrived in the city of Alexandria, and Herminius the governor saw\nthem, he marveled greatly at them, and wondered why they had forsaken their royal\nposition.  And the governor did not dare to speak abusive words to them, but he addressed\nthem with words of courtesy, and persuaded them earnestly to return to their honorable\nestate; but they would not hearken unto him.  And straightway he became filled with wrath\nat Justus, and he separated them from each other; Justus he sent to the city of Antinoe, and\nhis wife to the city of Sa, and his son ‘Aboli to the city of Basta; and he gave to each of\nthem one of their servants to minister unto them.  And when Abba ‘Aboli had arrived in\nthe city of Basta, he confessed our Lord Jesus Christ before the governor, who tortured\nhim severely, and burnt him with fire, and put him on the wheel, and cut off his limbs, and\ncast him to the lions.  And God gave him strength, and delivered him, and raised him up\nwhole and uninjured from the tortures.  And when many of the men who were there saw\nwhat happened to Saint ‘Aboli, after the torturing, they marveled exceedingly, and they\nbelieved on our Lord Jesus Christ and became martyrs.  And the governor was wroth with\nthe saint, and he commanded his soldiers to flay off his skin, and to dip rags of sackcloth\nin vinegar and salt, and to rub all his wounds therewith; [and they did so,] and then they\nlaid his skin upon his shoulders, and took him round through all the city.  And the saint\nprayed and said, “O my Lord Jesus Christ, Thou Son of the Living God, help me and\ndeliver me from this tribulation”; and forthwith the angel Michael came to him, and\ntouched his body, and healed his wounds; and the governor commanded the soldiers to\ntake him into the prison house until he could decide what he should do with him.  And the\nsaint stood up and prayed in prison, and whilst he was praying our Lord Jesus Christ\nappeared unto him, and He said unto him, “Peace be unto thee, O My chosen one ‘Aboli,\nbe strong and fear not, for I will be with thee until the end of thy fight”; and when He had\nsaid this unto him He went up into heaven in great glory.  And Saint ‘Aboli rejoiced with a\ngreat joy when he saw our Lord Jesus Christ.  And there was a certain rich man whose\nname was ‘Abskiron, and who had two sons, and he brought some workmen to pull down\nthe wall of his house and to rebuild it; and he commanded his two sons to stand by them\nuntil they finished their work.  And when the workmen went up on the wall it fell down\nand killed twelve of the workmen, and the two sons of the rich man; and when the rich\nman heard what had happened he rent his garments, and cried out and wept.  And he went\nto Saint Abba ‘Aboli, and bowed low at his feet and said unto him, “Have compassion\nupon me, for my two sons are dead with the seventeen (sic) workmen, if thou wilt raise\nthem up from the dead I will believe on thy God.”  And when he had said this unto him,\nthe holy man rose up and prayed, saying, “O my Lord Jesus Christ, Who hast chosen me to\nsuffer for Thy holy Name’s sake, do Thou make manifest Thy power over the men who are\ndead, and raise them up from the dead, so that all men may believe, and that all men may\n\nknow that there is no other God beside Thee; for Thine is the glory for ever and ever. \nAmen.”  And he took his skin and spread it out over those men, saying, “In the Name of\nmy Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Living God, do ye all rise up alive”; and he took\nthem by their hands, and raised them up, and all the people were looking on.   And\nstraightway they all cried out, saying, “One is the God of the Christians, Jesus Christ, the\nGod of Saint ‘Aboli.”  And straightway ‘Abskiron bowed down before the saint, saying,\n“Now do I know that Jesus Christ is the Great God:  I believe on Him”: and all the men of\nhis house believed with him, and the governor was put to shame.  And our Lord Jesus\nChrist appeared unto the saint and made him a promise, saying, “O My chosen one ‘Aboli,\nwhosoever shall ask Me for help in thy name when tribulation cometh upon him, I will\nhear his prayer and will fulfill all his petition and desire.  And I will make to dwell in My\nkingdom whosoever shall build a church in thy name.  And I will write upon the lips of the\nfour beasts, and I will make to rest in the bosom of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and will\nmake to eat of the dainty things of the Garden of Delight, every one who shall write down\nthe story of thy fight, or shall read it, or shall make someone else to hear it.  And even if he\nhath committed many sins, but doth repent, I will forgive him his sins.  And I will forgive\nthe sins of every one who shall feed the hungry in thy name, and I will make him to eat of\nthe fruits of the Garden; and My peace shall be with thee.   Amen.”   And when our\nRedeemer had said these things unto him, He gave him the salutation “Peace,” and went\nup into heaven with great glory.  And when the governor became tired of torturing him he\ncommanded the soldiers to cut off his head with the sword, and they cut off his holy head\nwith the sword, and he received the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens. \nAnd his body resteth in the monastery of Handak, outside the city of Mesr (Cairo), and\nmany signs and wonders take place through it, and great healings.  Salutation to ‘Aboli. \nSalutation to you, O ye company of two hundred and forty men and women who were\ntortured and beheaded with Saint ‘Aboli.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Saint Hannah, the mother of our Lady Mary, and\nHannah the prophetess, the daughter of Panuel.\nSalutation to the three virgins Pistis (Faith), ‘Alapis (Hope), and ‘Agapis (Charity), who\nsuffered martyrdom, but whose beauty was unspoiled by the smoke, and whose bodies\nwere unconsumed by the fire.\nAnd the fathers have commanded that on this day the people shall celebrate the\ncommemoration of the honorable men Joseph and Nicodemus, who were held to be\nworthy to become ministers of the Divine Mystery.   And they brought down from the\nCross the Body of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Living God, when He had fulfilled\nthe Law of the Incarnation in every respect, with the exception of sin, and He had accepted\nsuffering and death for the sake of the salvation of the [world].  So little did the terror of\nthe Jews frighten them that they asked Pilate to give them His Body, and when Pilate gave\nthem permission to carry Him away, they took Him down from the Cross, having\nwithdrawn the nails from out of His hands, and His feet, and they bore Him away on their\nshoulders.  And they heard a voice which came forth from His dead Body, saying, “Holy is\nthe Lord, Holy is the Power, Holy is the Life Which dieth not, and which the holy Virgin\nMary bore!  Have compassion upon us, O Lord.  Holy is the Lord, Holy is the Power, Holy\nis the Life Which dieth not, which was baptized in the Jordan, and was hung upon the\nwood of the Cross.  Have compassion upon us, O Lord.  Holy is the Lord, Holy is the\nPower, Holy is the Life Which dieth not, Which was raised up from the dead on the third\nday, Who went up into heaven with praise and sat down on the right hand of His Father,\nWho shall come again to judge the living and the dead.  Have compassion upon us, O\nLord.  Glory be to the Father.  Glory be to the Son.  Glory be to the Holy Spirit, now and\nhenceforth and forever.  Amen.  So be it!  So be it!”  And when they heard this their Faith\nin Christ was strengthened.   And Joseph brought linen cloths, and Nicodemus brought\nperfumed unguents, and they wrapped our Lord in them, and buried Him in a new grave. \nAnd this Joseph was kinsman to Nicodemus, the brother of Cleophas, the kinsman of\nStephen the martyr.  And Nicodemus was the Phrisee, and the legate of the Jews, who\nwent by night to our Lord Jesus Christ, and . . . His coming from heaven.  And our Lord\ntold him that it was impossible for a man to enter into the kingdom of the heavens, who\n\nwas not born of water and of the Holy Spirit; and Nicodemus used frequently to rebuke the\nJews when they derided the words of our Lord.  And after His Resurrection, as they were\ntravelling along the road to Emmaus, it was these two, Cleophas and Nicodemus, whom\nour Lord met; and they told Him everything which had happened in Jerusalem, without\nrecognizing Him.   And He told them that the prophets had prophesied concerning His\nDeath and Resurrection; and then when they recognized Him, He disappeared from them. \nAnd they brought His words to His disciples.  And Joseph the Jews bound fast in prison,\nand they wanted to kill him, because he had buried our Lord.  And although the door of the\nprison was sealed with the seal of Pilate, and with the seals of the high priests, our Lord\nJesus came to the place where Joseph was, and He was mounted on the chariot of the\nCherubim, and with Him there were thousands of thousands, and tens of thousands of tens\nof thousands of angels, and Seraphim standing round about Him, and burning incense\nbefore Him.  And the thief who was on His right hand stood on the right of Him wearing\nshining raiment, and he was making intercession for sinners, because he had found favor\nbefore Him; and the keepers of the house were terrified, and trembling seized them.  And\nthen our Lord cried out to Joseph and said unto him, “Be not afraid of the terrors of the\nJews.  Behold I have come to unloose thy bonds.  I am that Jesus, the Nazarene, in Whose\nsuffering thou didst participate.  Look at the nail [marks] in My hands and feet, and the\nmark of the spear in My side, so that thou mayest know that of a truth I am He.”  Then He\ncaught up Joseph from that place, and took him to the city of ‘Armatyas.  And the keepers\nof the prison house, having gone to Pilate, told him everything, which they had seen, and\nwhat they had heard from the mouth of our Lord, and how He had set free Joseph and\ntaken him away with Him.  And when the high priests went [there] they found the doors of\nthe prison open and their seals unbroken.  And these saints continued to preach the Gospel\nwith the Disciples, and very much tribulation came upon them; and then they died in\npeace.   Salutation to Joseph the rich man who begged the Body of Jesus from Pilate. \nSalutation to Nicodemus who believed on the Son of Mary.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and the saint\nbowed his head and wept.  And she asked him, saying, “Why dost thou weep?”  And he\nanswered and said unto her, “Because I see the Satans playing on thy face, and therefore I\nweep for thee.”  And she answered and said unto him, “Is it necessary for me to repent?” \nAnd the saint said unto her, “Yea.”  And she said unto him, “Take me away, and carry me\nwhithersoever thou wishest”: and he said unto her, “Come,” and she followed him, and\nthey departed and came into the desert.  And when the eventide was come he said unto her,\n“Sleep by thyself,” and after he had finished his prayer he lay down at a distance from her. \nAnd when he rose up at midnight to pray he saw pillar of light shining upon her, and the\npillar reached from earth to heaven, and he saw the angel of God bearing away her soul. \nAnd he rose up and went to her, and he found that she was dead, and he cast himself upon\nthe ground and prayed to God to give him information concerning her.  And there came\nunto him a voice, saying, “God accepted her repentance when she repented more readily\nthan He did the repentance of those who were in a state of repentance for many years, and\nwho repented even like her.”  And Saint John went and told the holy elders everything,\nwhich had happened unto her, and the saints came and made her ready for burial and\nburied her.  Salutation to Athanasia.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Saint Demiana and her brother.\nAnd on this day also died Saint Eupraxia.  This holy woman belonged to a race of kings.\nThen name of her father, who was a royal councilor, was “’Atekhanos,” and the name of\nher mother was “Eupraxia,” and they fasted, and prayed to God that He would give them a\nson; and when they had gotten this saint, they called her by her mother’s name\n“Eupraxia.”  And after a few days her father died, and the king and queen mourned for\nhim, and her mother took Saint Eupraxia to a house of virgins when she was six years old. \nAnd when she saw the beauty of the excellence of the virgins, she said unto them, “Why\ndo ye lead this life of service?”  And they told her, saying, “It is for Christ’s sake.”  And\nshe said unto them, “Where is Christ?”  And they showed her a picture of Christ, and she\ncame up to it, and bowed low before it, and kissed its feet.  And she went to the deacons,\n\nand asked [them] to received her as a nun, and they told her mother, and her mother gave\nher to the deaconess; and her mother, having handed her over to the care of all the virgins,\nleft her and departed.   And after a few days Eupraxia, her mother, died, and the saint\nassumed the garb of the monastic life; and she fought the spiritual fight continually and\nfasted every eighth day.  And Satans was envious of her, and tempted her, and sometimes\nhe threw her into the water, and sometimes he wounded her with the axe when she was\ncutting up wood, and sometimes he poured boiling water over her, but nothing harmed\nher.  And she continued to minister unto the virgins, to each in her turn.  Sometimes they\ncommanded her to tend the furnace, and sometimes to bake the bread, and sometimes to\ndraw water, and she never hesitated to perform these works.  She never lay down upon the\nground, but stood upright for forty days at a time, until at length the virgins marveled at\nthe severity of her fight.  And God made manifest by her hands signs and wonders, and the\nsick were healed, and the devils went out, and the lame walked, and the blind saw, when\nshe prayed over them.  And there was a certain virgin whose name was Iyalya, and it was\nshe who taught Eupraxis to read and to write, and the duties of the ascetic life; she was her\ncompanion in every work, and they loved each other very much.  And when she was thirty\nyears of age she saw a vision wherein the deacons were taking up Eupraxia into the royal\npalace, wherein was the heavenly Bridegroom and never-ending joy; and when she woke\nup she knew that the death of Eupraxia was nigh.  And on the following day she told the\nvirgins, and when they went to Eupraxia they found that she was in a high fever.  And they\nwept over her, and asked her to pray over them, and she blessed them, and died, and she\nwas buried in the tomb of her mother, at whose tomb she had prayed three days before. \nSalutation to Eupraxia.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and the abbot called Saint Abba Simon.  And when\nSimon stood before him the abbot saw blood, mixed with pus, flowing down upon his feet,\nand it was an exceedingly hard matter for the abbot.  And he opened Simon’s apparel and\nsaw the rope, which had cut, into his flesh, and the abbot was wroth with him, and said\nunto him, “Why hast thou dared to do this thing, which thou wishest to do with such toil?” \nAnd the abbot had the rope taken off the saint’s body.  And they continued to treat him in\nthis saving manner for a space of fifty days, until his wound was healed.  And the abbot\nsaid unto him, “O my son Simon, depart whithersoever thou wishest.”  And he went forth\nfrom them, and departed, and came unto a dry pit, and he dwelt therein with serpents and\nscorpions.  And the abbot saw a vision by night wherein it seemed that one said unto him,\n“Why dost thou send away My servant Simon?  Seek him, and bring him back, for it shall\nbe better for him than for thee in the Day of Judgment”; and the voice rebuked him very\nseverely because of the going forth of Abba Simon from the monastery.  And when the\nmorning had come, the abbot told all the brethren what he had seen, and how the voice had\nrebuked him because of Saint Simon; and the brethren were frightened, and were\nexceedingly sorry.  And the abbot said unto them, “Depart ye and search for him in every\nplace, and come not back to me until ye have found him.”  And they departed and searched\nfor him in many places, but they found him not.  And after this they went to that pit, and\nthey lighted a lamp, and they saw him seated with the serpents and scorpions, without food\nand without drink; and they let down a rope to him, and they drew him up out of the pit,\nand they bowed low before him and said unto him, “Forgive us our sin.”  And Saint Abba\nSimon said unto them, “Forgive ye me for having caused you all sorrow, for I have\ntransgressed the command of my teacher the abbot.”  And from the time when he took up\nhis abode in the pit until they took him out he had neither eaten bread nor drunken water;\nand they took him to the monastery, and he lived there a life of stern self-denial, and he\nfought many spiritual fights.  And when they had set him in the monastery, he craved not\nfor the glory of this fleeting world, and he left the brethren and fled from them, and\ndeparted secretly, and came to a certain rock, and stood up before it for sixty days without\nsleeping.  And after this the angel of the Lord came unto him, and comforted him, and\nmade him to know that Gad had called him for the salvation of many souls.  And then he\nstood for fifteen years upon a pillar, the height whereof was thirty cubits, and he\nperformed signs and many wonders, and great healings; and he used to teach all those who\ncame unto him.  And his father sought him but found him not, and he died before he could\nsee him.  And after many years his mother heard the report of him, and she came to him\nwhilst he was standing on the pillar, and she wept greatly; and then she used to sleep under\nthe pillar of the saint.  And the saint asked God to deal graciously with her, and she died\nwhilst she was sleeping, and they buried her under the pillar of the saint.   And Satan\nbecame envious of the saint;

and he died in peace and inherited the kingdom of heaven.  And when\nthe Archbishop of Antioch heard that Saint Abba Simon was dead, he came, bringing with\nhim priests, and deacons, and officers, and they took away the body of Saint Simon with\ngreat honor, and brought it to the city of Alexandria, with spiritual songs and psalms.  And\nthey laid it in a church there, and many signs, and wonders, and great healings took place\nthrough it.  Salutation to Simon of the Pillar.\nAnd on this day also died Saint Sophia.  This saint was a kinswoman of a race of kings,\nand she had riches and possessions, and she crossed the Sea of Rome with her three\ndaughters to received the seal of Christ.  And the Emperor Andrianus, knowing that she\nwas a Christian, had her and her daughters brought before him, and questioned her about\nher country and her name; and she said unto him, “The name which comes first with me is\nthat of ‘Christian’; as for what my kinsfolk call me, it is ‘Sophia,’ and I am of a noble\nfamily of Italy.  And the Lord Jesus Christ hath in His mercy brought me into thy city, that\nI may offer myself and my daughters as an offering.”  And she encouraged her daughters,\nand bade them not to fear the tortures.  And after this her three daughters finished their\ntestimony, and she wrapped them in shrouds and buried them outside the city.  And she\nwent out to celebrate the commemoration of her three daughters with many other women\nof the city, and when she arrived at their graves, she bowed down and prayed, saying, “O\nmy perfect daughters who are crowned with crowns incorruptible, may I too receive a\ncrown with you!”  And having said thee words she died in peace, and was buried with her\ndaughters.  Salutation to Sophia.\nSalutation to the translation of the body of Mercurius, the fighter, which was taken to a\nnew grave on the backs of three oxen.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and in\nsuch circumstances he fought the fight for fifty years.  The men in a certain city, from little\nto great, were pagans, and there was no man who was able to convert them to the True\nFaith.  One day when the bishop remembered the faith and the wisdom of Abba Abraham,\nhe urged him to become a priest, and to make the pagans believe; and with difficulty he\nappointed him a priest, and sent him thither.  And having come into their city, he built a\nchurch, and made prayer therein, and he entreated God to convert them to the knowledge\nof Himself.  And one day he came into the house of their idols, and cast them down from\ntheir seats.  And when the men of the city saw this, they were filled with wrath, and beat\nhim, and cast him out of the city, but when the night came they found him in the church\npraying.  And they also bound him with a rope, and dragged him outside the city, and they\ncast stones at him, and left him well-nigh dead, and went away.  And having risen up, by\nthe might of God, they found him praying for their conversion; and being bound with\nropes and dragged about by them he lived for three years.  And when God saw his patience\nHe turned their hearts to believe on Him, and they were baptized in the Name of the\nFather, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, from the least of them to the greatest; and they\nbecame strong in the Faith of Christ.  And when Abba Abraham saw the strength of their\nFaith, he was afraid lest they should bring upon him the pleasure of idleness, and he\nprayed to God, and made the sign of the Cross over the city.   And he went forth, not\nknowing where to go, and he departed to another city.  And Satan, the hater of good, set\nhimself in opposition to him and frightened him with many infernal devices, but the saint\nconquered him by the power of his prayer.  And he continued to fight many strenuous\nfights, and practiced severe abstinence, and not a day passed without his shedding tears; he\nnever laughed with his teeth, he never smiled with his lips, he never anointed his face, he\nnever washed his face and feet with water; and he thought each day that he might die that\nday.  And when his brother, according to the flesh, died, he left a daughter, seven years old,\nwhose name was Marta, and her kinsfolk took her to Abba Abraham, and she was brought\nup under his direction.  And he taught her the fear of God, and how to pray, and to fast,\nand to weep, and she was under his authority until she was twenty years of age.  And then\nSatan envied him, and he made her to be on such intimate terms with a certain monk that\nat length he destroyed her virginity; and she changed her apparel, and her nun’s garb, and\ndeparted to another city.   And that night the saint saw in a vision a huge serpent\nswallowing a dove, and there remained a little vomit under his feet.  And on the following\nday when Mary (sic) was missing from her place, Abraham was frightened, and he prayed\nto God, with tears, that He would enable him to find her.  And after a few days he heard\nwhere she was, and he changed his apparel, and wrapped his face in cloth, so that [none]\nmight know him, and he mounted a horse, and arrayed himself and departed to that city;\nand when he arrived there, he went to the place where she was.  And when he saw her\ndressed like a serving woman in a tavern, he was very sorry that she had left her seclusion,\nbut he did no know how he could have prevented her flight.  And then he gave the master\nof the house one dinar, which he had brought with him, so that he might prepare for him\nfood and drink wherewith to make merry with Mary (sic), and he pretended to her that he\n\nwished to commit sin with her.  And after supper he had her brought inside the house, and\nhe took her hand and looked her in the face, and when she recognized him she became like\na dead body.  And he said unto her, “Fear not, O my daughter, for thy sin lieth upon me. \nThere is no man without sin, except God.  Come, return to thy old life and habit”; and she\nsaid unto him, “I will.”  And on the following day he took her with him, and he set her on\na horse, which he led by the bridle, and he marched along rejoicing, because he had\nsnatched his daughter (sic) out of the hand of Satan.  And when he had come to his house,\nhe shut her up in a chamber, and she repented in sackcloth and seclusion, and she\nsubmitted so completely to his authority that all those who heard about her marveled.  And\nGod made manifest through her signs and wonders in connection with the casting out of\ndevils and the healing of the sick.  And when Abba Abraham had watched her repentance\nfor ten years, he died at the age of seventy winters, praising God.  And Mary (sic) lived\nfine years longer, and devoted herself more and more to the ascetic life, and to weeping by\nday and by night, and then she died; and those who saw her ascribed glory to God because\nof the great light which was on her face.  Salutation to Abraham.\nAnd on this day also died Saint John, the fighter of the spiritual fight, the soldier.  This\nsaint had Christian parents.  He was a soldier in the army of Julian, and with him were\nother soldiers, and [Julian] commanded them to afflict the Christian people wheresoever\nthey went.  And he was the soldier at the head of his companions, and pretended outwardly\nto them that he hated the Christians, and wished to make war upon them, but in secret he\nfought on their behalf, and did good unto them, and gave them whatsoever they wanted. \nAnd he used to fast and pray continually, and give alms.  And he lived a life like unto the\nlives of the saints, and he pleased God, and died in peace, and many miracles were seen at\nhis grave.  Salutation to John, the soldier.\nAnd on this day also died Abba Philip of Debre Bizen.  Salutation to Philip.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

which actually took place through\nMary, the bearer of God in the flesh.  This righteous man Joachim, and his wife Hannah,\nwere very old in days, and they had produced no child, for Hannah was barren, and they\nwere exceedingly sorrowful because of this, for the children of Israel used to thrust aside\nhim that had not begotten a son, and would say unto him, “O thou who lackest the blessing\nof God.”  Because of this the hearts of this righteous man and his wife were sad, and they\nfasted, and prayed, and entreated God frequently by day and by night [for a child]; and\nthey had reached old age and had become old.   And they begged and entreated God\nfrequently, and they vowed a vow to Him that if they got a child they would make him a\nministrant in the Temple of God.  And Joachim was in the sanctuary praying frequently\nand making supplication, and behold, slumber descended upon him and he slept, and\nGabriel, the angel of God, appeared unto him, and told him that Hannah his wife would\ncertainly conceive, and bear a daughter wherein he would rejoice, and because of whom\nhis eyes would sparkle;

and from that hour\nPeter became the head of all the Apostles.  And he took the place of our Lord in the city of\nRome, and his position was above that of the chiefs of the world, and of Archbishops, and\nBishops, and Priests, and Deacons, and every other order of the priesthood.  Glory be to\nour Lord Jesus Christ.   Salutation to Peter, the chief of the Apostles and of all the\npriesthood of the world.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father, Abba Timothy, the twenty-sixth Archbishop of\nthe city of Alexandria.  God chose this saint, and appointed him Archbishop of the city of\nAlexandria, after the holy father and spiritual fighter Dioscoros died.  And great tribulation\ncame upon him, and they drove him out into exile in the island of Gagra, whither they had\ndriven Dioscoros the Archbishop, who had lived there before Abba Timothy for six years. \nAnd then the Emperor Leo sent and brought him back from exile with great honor.  And\nafter Marcian had become emperor, he appointed an Archbishop of Alexandria.  And after\n\nMarcian died, the men of Alexandria rose up against the archbishop whom Marcian had\nappointed, and killed him; and [they] appointed Timothy archbishop according to the\ncommand of Abba Dioscoros.   When Leo, the son of Marcian, became emperor he\nappointed Archbishop of the city of Alexandria one who was called Timothy, and ‘Abbas,\nthe Archbishop, he exiled to the island of Gagra, the place where he exiled Dioscoros;

And when they\ncame back Maximianus said unto them, “What did ye do?”  And they said unto him, “We\nbelieve in Christ, the God of Saint Christopher.”  And when the governor heard this he\ncommanded the soldiers to hang one of them on a tree and to burn her with fire, and to tie\na stone to the neck of the other and to hang her, head downwards; and thus they finished\ntheir martyrdom.   And then he called Christopher, and they gathered together old, dry\nwood, and set it on fire, and they cast the saint into the flames, his hands and his feet being\nbound, but the fire did not touch him.  And when the people saw this, they all believed,\nand ten thousand men were slain.  And they also brought plates of iron made red-hot, and\nthey made the saint to stand upon them, but it injured him not.  And when the men of\nRome saw [this] they believed on our Lord Jesus Christ, and twenty-thousand and two\nhundred of them, and forty children, believed and became martyrs.   And when\nMaximianus saw that all the people believed, he was wroth with Christopher and\ncommanded the soldiers to cut off his head with the sword.  And having gone forth from\nthe emperor’s presence, the saint made a prayer, and sealed his face with the sign of the\nCross, and then the soldiers cut off his head with the sword and he finished his\nmartyrdom.  Salutation to Christopher.\nAnd on this day also Saint Bikabos and John became martyrs.  Bikabos was from the city\nof ‘Esmutenakha, and he was a soldier; he was a Christian in secret, and one told\nAntiochus the governor about him and about the Bishop Abba ‘Aklog, and about Abba\nNakharew, who was from the city of Tarsa, and about Abba Philip.   And when one\ninformed the governor that they were Christians, he had them brought before him, and he\nsaid unto them, “Are ye Christians?”  And they confessed our Lord before him and said,\n\nboldly, “Indeed we are Christians, and we believe on our Lord and Redeemer Jesus Christ,\nthe Son of the Living God.”  And the governor said unto them, “Put away this thing from\nyou, and offer sacrifice to the gods.”  And the saints answered and said unto him, “We will\nnot sacrifice to unclean idols, which are to be rejected, we will only sacrifice to our Lord\nJesus Christ, the Creator of the heavens and the earth.”  And when the governor heard this\nhe was exceedingly angry, and he tortured them very severely.   And he tortured Saint\nBikabos severely, and often, and he bound him in iron fetters, and threw him on the wheel,\nand hanged him, head downwards, and cut off his limbs; and God strengthened him to\nendure, and He raised him up whole and uninjured.  And after this the governor sent the\nsaint, with many other martyrs, to the city of Baramun in a ship, and for sixteen days he\nneither ate bread nor drank water.  And when they came to the city of Baramun the soldiers\ntortured the saint very severely, and then they hacked his body in pieces, and he finished\nhis martyrdom, and received his crown in the kingdom of heaven.   And a certain rich\nofficial of the city of Baramun took the body of the saint and wrapped it up in costly\ncloths, and sent it to the city of ‘Esmunatekha.   And in the days of his torturing an\ninnumerable multitude of people became martyrs, and through his finishing his martyrdom\nfive and ninety souls became martyrs.  And they built a beautiful church for Saint Bikabos,\nand they laid his body therein, and many signs and wonders took place through it. \nSalutation to Abba Bikabos.\nSalutation to the ancient Lawgivers and to the Evangelists who followed after them.\nSalutation to the three thousand, two hundred, and twenty men and two women, who\nsuffered martyrdom through Christopher.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and there was rebellion and great tumult in the city\nof Alexandria for many years.  And when Marcianus died, and Leo reigned, the people of\nRome set over themselves a man from the city of Alexandria, whose name was Abrutarius,\nas archbishop.   He had been a priest in the city of Alexandria, and he believed in the\nCouncil of Chalcedon.  Only a few of the Alexandrians accepted him, and the rest of the\npeople received the Holy Mysteries from the priests whom our father Abba Cyril and Abba\nDioscoros had appointed.  And when Abrutarius was appointed, he formed a company of\nhis friends who believed his words, and he excommunicated ‘Awtaki (Eutyches), the\npriest, who declared that the Godhead [of Christ] was mingled in His Incarnation.  And by\nthis he wished to seduce the man of the city, and to make them at length to enter into an\nevil faith; and they believed his words, because they thought that our father Dioscoros and\nhis company agreed with ‘Awtaki (Eutyches) in [his] denial.  Now our father Dioscoros\nexcommunicated ‘Awtaki (Eutyches), and he cursed all those who mingled the Godhead of\nChrist with His Incarnation.  How could one turn and believe his words?  Nay, the Faith of\nour father Dioscoros was like the Faith of Saints Basil, and Gregory, and Cyril, who\nbelieved in the One Nature of God, the Word, Which became incarnate, and not that the\nGodhead changed and became flesh, and not that the flesh changed and became Godhead,\nbut that each of them remained by Itself.  And it was not right for them to say that Christ\nbecame Two Natures, and Two Persons, and Two Things after His Union, which did not\ndestroy [His] Unity.  And ‘Awtaki (Eutyches) believed in the mingling of Nature.  Our\nfathers excommunicated those who separate the Natures, after they had become One, and\nlikewise they excommunicated those who mingle them after they were separated.  And on\nthe day following the Council which Abrutarius had gathered together, they found\nAbrutarius killed in his house, and his companions said that it was one of the disciples of\nour father Abba Dioscoros who had killed him.  And he said unto them, “We are brethren. \nPerhaps it is one of the companions of ‘Awtaki (Eutyches) who hath killed him, or perhaps\nthieves killed him in order to carry off his money.”  And this was true, for the Council did\nnot assemble on account of us, nor because of us; but we agree in the excommunication of\n‘Awtaki (Eutyches).  And the companions of Abrutarius sent a letter to the king wherein\nthey said, “Behold, the people have treated the government with insolence, and have\nbehaved contemptuously towards the emperor, and have killed the archbishop whom the\nemperor appointed.”  And whilst they were gathered together because of this thing, behold\nour brethren assembled and appointed Abba Timothy archbishop over them.  And those\nwicked men sent another royal official, one ‘Abrotari, to the emperor, saying, “Behold\nthey have killed Abrutarius and have appointed over them an archbishop without the\nemperor’s command.”   And the emperor was exceedingly angry because of these two\nletters, and Satan entered into him, and he sent many soldiers, and they slew of our\nbrethren three thousand Orthodox Christians, small and great, slaves and free men, and he\nexiled Abba Timothy to the island of Gagra, where he lived for seven years.  And if [they\nsay] that one of the servants of Abba Dioscoros killed Abrutarius, as Satan taught them,\nthey speak falsehood.  Was it meet that they should kill three thousand men instead of one\nman, especially as they did not kill any one of the wicked Arian heretics, who killed\nbishops and priests?  But let everyone know that this took place through the operation of\nSatan.  And after this shameful slaughter, the emperor knew that our brethren did not kill\nAbrutarius, and that they did not know who did kill him.   And the emperor sent and\nbrought back Timothy from the island, and he paid him great honor, and set him upon the\nthrone of his office in the city of Alexandria.  And he sat in the days of Leo for twenty-two\nyears.  Salutation to those who died by violence.\n\nAnd on this day also Saint Damianus became a martyr.  They tortured this saint in the city\nof Antioch with every kind of cruel torture.  When the governor was tired of torturing him,\nhe commanded [the soldiers] to cut off his head, and they cut off his head, and the saint\nreceived the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  Salutation to Damianus\nthe martyr, the workman of Jesus.\nSalutation to Mary the daughter of Abraham.\nSalutation to Abraham, the Friend of God.\n \nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

his wife was barren, and they\nused to pray to God to give them a son.  And whilst they were living thus, Satan made\nMatalome governor of Damot, and he laid waste the whole of the districts of Showa, up to\nthe border of ‘Amhara.  And all the nobles, one after the other, gave him their women, and\nthe beautiful women whom he found during his raid he made his concubines.  And in those\ndays he came to the city of Selalesh and killed all the Christians, and Saga Ze'ab fled in\nfear, and fell into a pool of water, which became like a tent.   And Egzi’E Haraya the\nsoldiers seized and carried off, and they brought her to Matalome.  And when he saw her\nbeauty he rejoiced exceedingly, and he adorned her with apparel of fine linen.  Then he\nreturned to his country, and his nobles gathered together in order to make ready for the\nfeast of his marriage with her; and when Egzi’E Haraya heard this she made prayer to God\nthat He would deliver her from this unclean union.   And straightway Michael the\narchangel came and he took her up upon his wings, and brought her into the church at the\ntime of the third hour, and as Saga Ze'ab was going out of the church he saw her standing\ndressed in ornamental apparel.  And he said, “Who is this woman?”  And when he asked\nher he knew that she was his wife; and she told him everything which had happened to her\nfrom the beginning to the end.  One night Michael, the angel of God, appeared unto them,\nand told them that they should produce a son whose righteousness should be heard of in all\nthe ends of the earth, and that the heavens and the earth would not be sufficient [to\ncontain] one of his excellences.  And after a few days this saint was conceived, on the\ntwenty-fourth day of the month of Megabit, and he was born on the twenty-fourth day of\nthe month of Tahsas; and there was joy in the house of his father and mother.  On the day\nwhen they gave him Christian baptism they called him “Zara Yohannes.”  On the third day\nafter he was born, he cried out, saying, “One is the Holy Father, One is the Holy Son, One\nis the Holy Spirit.”  And he grew in the Holy Spirit, and in wisdom, and he worked signs\nand wonders, thus:  When anything which was used for food was wanting in his father’s\nhouse, he would touch, with a smile, a little flour, and fill all the house therewith, and he\ndid the same with olive oil, and honey, and fat, and wine; and he would fill the house so\nfull that everyone who saw it, and heard of it, marveled.  And when he was seven years old\nhis father taught him the Psalms of David, and all the Books of the Church.  And then he\ntook him to the Bishop, Abba Cyril, who made him a deacon and prophesied concerning\nhim, saying, “This boy shall become a chosen vessel of God,” and having received the\noffice of deacon [he departed] to his own country.  When he was a young man, he used to\ntraverse the desert hunting wild beasts, and [one day] at noon, our Lord appeared unto\nhim, sitting upon the wings of Michael, and said unto him, “O My beloved, henceforward\nthou shalt not be a hunter of wild beasts, but thou shalt catch many souls in [thy] net.  And\nthy name shall be ‘Takla Haimanot,’ for I have chosen thee from thy mother’s womb, and I\nhave sanctified thee like Jeremiah the prophet, and John the Baptist.  And behold, I have\ngiven thee power to heal the sick, and to drive out unclean spirits in all the world”; and\nhaving said these words He disappeared, and the saint returned to his abode.  And after a\nfew days his father and his mother died, and he gave all his goods to the poor and needy,\nand he left all the house open, and took his staff and went forth by night, saying, “What\nshall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and destroy his soul?”  And then he took\nthe rank of priest, and began to preach the Faith in all the country of Showa; and he\nbaptized seventy thousand people in his own country.  And he destroyed all the shrines of\nidols, and cut down the trees thereof, so that the devils, who used to dwell in them, might\ntake to flight.  And after three years a voice cried unto him from heaven, saying, “O Takla\nHaimanot, rise up and go to the land of Damot, that thou mayest receive for me much\n\nspoil.”  And as he was journeying along the road of ‘Enarte’at, he met some men, who\nwere magicians and diviners, and their king, and they were performing acts of divination. \nDuring the violent quarrel which he had with them, they beat him with a thick iron rod,\nuntil the bones showed through his skin, and he died; but God gave him strength to endure,\nand He raised him up sound and unharmed.  And he remained thus for four mornings, and\nafter he had prayed the earth swallowed up the magicians and their beasts.  Passing on\nfrom that place he arrived at the country of Damot, and he destroyed the diviners.  And\nwhen Motalame, the governor, heard of him, he commanded his soldiers to bring him to\nhim, bound with strong fetters, and he said unto him, “Why dost thou destroy my\ncountry?”  And having said this to him, he commanded the soldiers to kill him, and to cast\nhim down a precipice several times.  And God gave him strength to endure, and He raised\nhim up unharmed.   And having performed signs and wonders before the governor and\ndestroyed the soothsayers, he made the governor to believe on Christ, for he raised up\nbefore him many dead persons.  Now those who were baptized with him, on that day, were\nin number twelve thousand and ninety-nine souls.   And when the wherewithal for the\nadministration of the Holy Mysteries was lacking Michael brought down to him [some oil\nof] Meron from heaven, and he said unto him, “Consecrate the Tabernacle with this, and\nadminister the Holy Mysteries to the people”; and he did as Michael told him.  And our\nfather continued to teach the king the Books of the Prophets and Apostles.  And when he\nhad lived in Damot for twelve years, a voice cried to him from heaven on Easter Day, and\nour Lord gave him the promise that He would give the kingdom of heaven unto all those\nwho called upon his name and celebrated his commemoration, and that he would deliver\nthem from all tribulation and sorrow.  And the voice also said unto him, “Go thou to the\ncountry of ‘Anhare, to Abba Betselote Mikael,” and when he had arrived there he lived\nwith him for ten years; and he served by day with his disciples, and during the night he\nmade innumerable bowings to the ground.  And he worked the flour mill, and drew water,\nand cut wood for the fire ceaselessly.  And besides this, he wrought many miracles, raising\nthe dead, and healing sick folk without number.  And then God said unto him, “O My\nbeloved Takla Haimanot, go thou to the place (or, shrine) of Stephen, the first to martyrs,\nwhich is called Hayk, and there thou shalt find a holy man whose name is Iyesus Moa, and\nhe will give thee the order of monkhood.”  And he rose up and departed, and came to the\nsea-coast, and passed over the sea as if he were on dry land, without wetting his feet. \nWhen he came to the holy man, he welcomed him, and gave him the apparel of the monk,\n[that is to say,] the tunic and the head cloth only; and he dwelt there for ten years working\nsigns and wonders, and each [night] he made seven thousand bowings.  And then God said\nunto him, “O My beloved Takla Haimanot, go thou to the land of Tegre, and go up the\nmountain which is called Damo, and thou shalt find there a holy man whose name is\n‘Yohanni,’ and take thou from him the cap and cloak, and dwell there until I tell thee.” \nAnd he dwelt there fighting the fight, having received the cap and the cloak, for twelve\nyears.  And God appeared unto him and said unto him, “Get thee out of this mountain, and\ntravel about through the deserts of Tegre and visit the monasteries and houses of the\nmonks.”  And he went down from that high mountain, being exhausted by the toil thereof,\nand he traveled through the deserts of Tegre.  And having finished this he went down to\nJerusalem, Michael, the angel, guiding him, and when he came to the Red Sea he passed\nover it, according to his wont, without wetting his feet.  Having crossed the sea he came to\nJerusalem, and he went round and visited all the holy places.  And he returned to the land\nof Tegre and talked and mixed with all the saints; and he went down to Jerusalem a second\nand a third time, and wished to dwell there.  And the Holy Spirit said unto him, “Go back\nto the land of Muladek, for that is thy lot.”  And going back he visited Abba Yohanni of\nDebra Damo.   Thence he went down and traveled on towards Bur, and he found\nMedhaninne ‘Egzi’E, in a place the name of which is Gwonaguena, and that saint gave\nhim the garb of the monkhood, and prophesied to him that he should become the father of\nall the monks of Tegre, and the son of Abba Samuel of Waldebba, and of all the teachers\nwho were in Tegre.  And when our father Takla Haimanot had gone out from Tegre, he\nwent to the place of Hayk and gave to Iyesus Moa the cap and the cloak.  Thence having\ngone out and passed through all the deserts, he came to the land of Showa, and he dwelt in\nthe desert of Geda for many days.  And then he departed to the land of Gerarya, and he\nmade a cell among the rocks and he went out neither by day nor by night.   And his\n\ndisciples were in number seventeen, and many came to him, both men and women, and\nthey became monks and widows, and they lived in one house; but no man had knowledge\nof any woman, because Satan was fettered by prayer.  And then he built in his cell a kind\nof wall to lean against, and he fixed therein sharp points, behind him, on his right hand,\nand on his left, so that they could pierce his body.  And having stood in the cell too long,\nthe thigh bone of one of his legs broke, and then he stood up on one foot for seven years. \nAnd our Lord Jesus Christ came unto him, with our Lady Mary, and with the prophets and\napostles, and the righteous, and the martyrs, and Michael and Gabriel, and He said unto\nhim, “O My beloved, thou dost resemble Me in My suffering, and I will make thee My\nequal in My kingdom.  And behold, thy weakness in this world is ended, and it hath been\naccepted by Me.  Come, that henceforth thou mayest inherit everlasting life”; and then He\ngave him the promise concerning those who should call upon his name, and celebrate his\ncommemoration.  And then the saint became slightly sick of the plague, and he died at a\ngood old age, his days being ninety-nine years and eight months.  And they wrapped him\nin cloths with reverence and praise, and buried him in his rock.   Salutation to Takla\nHaimanot.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father, the fighter and conqueror, the soldier and apostle\nof Christ, Thomas, Bishop of the city of Mar’as, the confessor.  The tongues of men are\nincapable of describing the glory and righteousness of this saint.   Beings of flesh are\nincapable of understanding his excellences and virtues.   Originally this saint was an\nascetic, and a fighter of the spiritual fight.  He fasted and prayed frequently, and kept vigil\nby night and by day, and he gave alms in abundance to the poor and needy.  And God\nchose him and made him Bishop of the city of Mar’as, and he protected his flock like the\nApostles.  And when Diocletian the wicked was reigning, one of his governors came to the\ncity of Mar’as to torture the Christians.  And he sent some wicked soldiers to this holy\nfather, and they seized him and brought him to him, and they beat him, as they dragged\nhim over the ground, and he arrived in the presence of the governor with his blood\ndropping on the ground.  And the governor said unto him, “Deny Christ and worship the\ngods.”  And the saint answered and said unto him, “I will not worship filthy stones, I will\nworship only my Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Living God.  Cursed art thou, and thy\nfilthy idols, and cursed are those who worship them.”  And the governor was wroth with\nSaint Thomas, and he tortured him very severely, and he beat him very cruelly, and he\nhung him up, and boiled pitch and poured it into his mouth and nostrils, and he tortured\nhim for many days.  Now the hearts of those deniers of Christ were like unto stones, and\nthey did not want the saint to die quickly, so they prolonged his torture in order to frighten\nthe multitude, and make them to deny Christ; but they were vanquished, and whilst they\nwere weary of torturing him, he was strong in rebuking them.  And they cast him into a\ndark place and forgot him, and he dwelt in that one place for twelve years.  And each year\nthe wicked men came to him, and tortured him, and cut off one of his limbs.  And in this\nplace they cut off his ears, and his nose, and his lips, and his hands, and his feet, and they\npulled out his front teeth and his grinders, and his whole body was as black as ink.  And\nthey forgot him in that dark prison house until at length those members of his flock, who\nknew him, thought that he was dead, and they used to perform services of commemoration\nfor him every year.  And when they shut him up in prison, a certain believing woman saw\nhim, and she used to come to him by night secretly, and throw in food to him through a\nlittle window.  And he lived in this way until the righteous Emperor Constantine reigned,\nand revealed the True Faith of Christ.  And he commanded his officers to release all the\nconfessors who were shut up in prison throughout all his dominions.  And that believing\nwoman went into their houses and told the priests about Saint Thomas, and what had\nhappened to him, and how they had shut him up in prison for two and twenty years, and\nshe guided them to the place where he was.  And they came to him, and took him out of\nthe prison house, and they carried him on their heads, singing as they went, until they\nbrought him into the church and set him on the throne before the sanctuary.  And all the\nChristians came and received a blessing from him, and they kissed [the places of] his\neyelids, which had been cut off.   And when the Emperor Constantine assembled the\nGeneral Council of the Three Hundred and Eighteen holy Bishops in the city of Nicea, this\nfather was present with them; and the Emperor Constantine embraced them, and received a\n\nblessing from them.  And when one made known unto him the fight of this holy father, he\ndrew nigh unto him, and bowed low before him, and he kissed all the places whereupon\nhis limbs had been cut off, and he stroked his face and eyes.  And after they had disputed\nwith Arius, the apostate, and vanquished him, and had excommunicated him and cursed\nhim, and driven him out, even as the Holy Spirit taught them, and they had proclaimed\nwith their tongues the True Faith, and drawn up the Law and the Judicial Regulations and\nthe Canons, this holy father Abba Thomas departed to the seat of his office.   And he\nassembled the priests and all his flock, and he proclaimed to them the True Faith, and he\nexplained unto them what they found difficult, and he made them to understand it, and he\ncommanded them to keep it and to wax strong therein.  And after this he lived a few days,\nand having pleased God he died in peace; and all the days of his office were forty years. \nAnd he departed to God bearing a crown of victory, and inherited everlasting life. \nSalutation to Thomas.\nAnd on this day also nine (or, ninety) thousand martyrs of the company of Saint Thomas\nwere crowned.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and one of his slaves told his wife Antolia, and when she heard it she departed to\nthe prison, rejoicing to be associated with him.  And she kissed the fetters of the four and\ntwenty saints, and she besought them to encourage her husband to endure every trial.  And\nto him she said, “O my lord, let not this infidel lead thee astray.  Thy beauty, thy grace, thy\ngold and thy silver are all vanity; follow Christ so that thou mayest find with Him the\nkingdom which never passeth away”; and having said this she went to her house.  And\nwhen Andrianus knew that they were going to bring him to the torture, he went\nstraightway to bid her farewell, and when she heard him arrive, she thought that he had\nescaped from the prison, and she shut the door against him, and reviled him from the\ninside of her house, saying, “Yesterday I called thee ‘martyr’ and to-day thou hast denied\nChrist!”  And when Andrianus saw [the strength] of her Faith, he marveled exceedingly,\nand said unto her, “Open to me, O my sister, for I have come to bid thee farewell.”  When\nshe heard this she opened the door to him; and then he took her into the prison, telling her\neverything.  And when Antolia had come into the prison she saluted the saints, and washed\ntheir wounds.  And the overseer commanded his men to bring the saints out of prison, and\nwhen he saw that they were exhausted by their torturing, he set Andrianus in front of them,\nand said unto him, “Sacrifice to the gods”; and when Andrianus reviled him the governor\ncommanded them to beat him with sticks.  When Antolia heard this she entreated the saints\nto pray for him.  And the governor also commanded the soldiers to beat him on his belly,\nuntil his bowels gushed out.  Now at that time Andrianus was eight and twenty years old. \nAnd then they took him into the prison with the holy martyrs, and Antolia came and wiped\naway the blood from Andrianus and the saints, and she embraced him, saying, “Rejoice,\nfor thy name is written in the heavens.”  And then the governor commanded the soldiers to\nbring a blacksmith’s hammer and to break the thighs of the saints therewith.  And Antolia\nplaced first of all the hands and the feet of Andrianus under the hammer, and the soldiers\nsmote, and broke off his hands and his feet, and smashed his bones, and at length he\ndelivered up his soul.  Similarly they smashed the thighs of all the saints, and cast their\nbodies into the fire, which did them no harm.  And then the believers took their bodies to\nanother city, and they hid them until the days of persecution were passed.  And Antolia\ntook the portions of the hands of Andrianus which had been cut off, and laid them by her\npillow.  And then the governor of the city wished to marry her, and as soon as she heard\nabout it she fled by boat, taking the fragments of the hands of Andrianus with her.  And she\ncame to the place where the bodies of the saints were, and she asked them to receive her\nwith them, and God accepted her petition, and she died whilst she was sleeping, and was\nburied with the saints.  Salutation to Andrianus.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Bisaryon (Bessarion) the Great.   The\nparents of this saint were faithful Christians and God-fearing people.  When this father\n\ngrew up he wished to put on the garb of the monastic life, that is to say, the garb of the\nangels, and to devote himself to God.  And he went forth from this world, and renounced\nit, and he departed to Saint Abba Anthony, and became his disciple and ministered unto\nhim for many years.  And after this he went to Abba Macarius, and ministered unto the\nholy elders who were monks. and then he wandered about in the desert of Scete; he never\nlodged in a place which had a roof, and he possessed absolutely nothing.  He had neither a\nwhole garment nor a bed, but only rags of coarse hairy sackcloth, which he girded about\nhis loins, and he used to go round to the cells and caves of the monks, and sit down by the\nside of the doors thereof weeping.  And when there went out to him someone who knew\nhim [not], and said unto him, “O my father, what maketh thee weep?”  [the saint would\nreply,]  “My riches have all been destroyed, and I have escaped from death.  My family\nhas fallen from honor into disgrace.”  He who did not understand what his words meant\nwould console him, and say unto him, “God shall restore to thee thy riches which have\nbeen destroyed,” and give him some bread; and the saint would take it and go and give it\nto others.  But those who understood what his words meant would know that what he was\nreferring to was the spoliation of the virtues of the children of man by Satan.  His purity,\nand virginity, and sincerity resembled those of the angels.  And the fathers have described\nthe fights which he fought in his spiritual battles when he lived among them; thus for forty\ndays he never lay down on the ground at all to sleep, and on many occasions, during his\nspiritual fights, he often fasted for forty days at a time.  And he continued to fight the\nspiritual fight for seven and forty years.  And many great miracles were made manifest\nthrough him and of these the holy elders and monks speak.  Saint Dulas and Saint John\nrelate a story concerning him, and say that they went with him to the shore of the Red Sea,\nand that they were suffering exceedingly from thirst.  And when he knew that they were\nthirsty he prayed to God and made the bitter water sweet, and they drank thereof.  And on\nanother occasion he came to the river Takazze, [wishing] to cross over, and that as he\nfound no ferry he prayed, and [then] walked on his feet on the surface of the water to the\nother side.  And one day they brought to Scete a man who had a devil that the holy elders\nmight heal him by their prayers.  And the fathers discussed the matter among themselves\nand said, “If we acquaint the holy elder Abba Bisaryon (Bessarion) with the story of the\nman in whom is a devil he will not heal [him], for he fleeth from [worldly] honor and [the\npraise] of men.”  And the fathers made a plan, and they caused the man in whom was a\ndevil to lie down in the church, on the place where Abba Bisaryon (Bessarion) used to\nstand up to pray.  And when the saint came into the church and found the man there asleep,\nhe woke him up and seized him by his hands, and said unto him, “Rise up,” and the man\nrose up straightway, sound in heart and healed of his disease.  And those who saw him\nmarveled exceedingly, and they glorified God for the grace which is given unto those who\nfear him.  And this father performed very many miracles besides this, and he pleased God\nand died in peace.  Salutation to Abba Bisaryon (Bessarion).\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Elianus the martyr, and his sister Eudoxia.\nSalutation to the company of priests of the brotherhood of Andrianus.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and he came to\nthe land of Karan (Harran), which country God showed him.  And when his parents died\nGod removed him again to the land of Palestine, and He promised him that he should\ninherit it; and he had confidence in God’s promise until he died, and his heart remained\nunshaken and free from doubt.  Moreover, he knew, and believed, that God would give\nthat land to his seed after him.  And after that God appeared unto him at midday in the\nform of a man, as he thought, and with Him were two angels, and Abraham thought they\nwere like unto all the other men who used to pass along the road every day.  And he made\na meal for them, and God gave him the promise concerning Isaac his son, one year before\nhe got him.  Now, at that time the days of Abraham were one hundred years, and his wife\nSarah was far advanced in her days.  And Abraham believed God, and doubted not, and\nwhen he got Isaac, God commanded him to circumcise him on the eighth day, on which\nday he circumcised his son.  And having believed, according to his confidence, there came\nto him the seed which God promised him.  And God said unto him, “Offer up as a sacrifice\nto Me thy son Isaac, on the mountain which I will show thee, and that place was Golgotha,\nwhere the body of our father Adam was buried,” and he neither doubted nor hesitated at\nthe word of God.  And he took Isaac and laid him on the altar, and he knew that God was\nable to take Isaac away, and yet that Isaac should be to him a seed.  And having completed\nthe sacrifice of Isaac in his mind, though not in deed, God showed Abraham’s\nrighteousness and virtues to all succeeding generations.  And then the angel of God called\nto him, and told him not to stretch out his hands over the young man, and do him no harm\nwhatsoever.  And God said unto him, “Behold, it is manifest that thou lovest Me, for thou\nhast not spared thy beloved son for My sake.  Therefore I will bless thee with blessing, and\nI will multiply thee in great number, and I will make thy seed like the stars of heaven, and\nlike the sand of the sea-shore.”  And it was even so, and God revealed Abraham’s work\nfrom that time and for ever, and the report of him and his name were heard in all the ends\nof the earth.  And it is evident why he was called the “Father of Christ” in the flesh, for He\nappeared from his seed ...  And the spiritual fighting of this father, and his virtues, and his\nrighteousness, and his mercy, and his gifts, which were many, were very great.  He did not\neat every day, but only when travelers came to him and sat at his table, and it is evident\nfrom this that he sat with God and His angels before he knew Him, though afterwards he\nknew them.   And tribulation and great sorrow came upon him in his days, for he was\nseparated from his father, and from his kinsfolk, and he was a wonderer on the earth.  And\nwhen he arrived in the land of Egypt, he was afraid of the infidels in the days of Pharaoh,\nKing of Egypt.  And when Pharaoh, King of Egypt, heard the report of Sarah, he called\nAbraham and asked him, saying, “Who is this woman who is with thee?”  And Abraham\nsaid, “She is my sister,” and Pharaoh took her from him.  And that night a terrifying angel\nappeared unto Pharaoh, and wanted to kill him, and he commanded Pharaoh to send back\nSarah to her husband, and said that if he would not do so he would destroy him.  And\nwhen the morning was come Pharaoh called Abraham and said unto him, “Why didst thou\nsay unto me ‘This woman is my sister.’  She is thy wife”; and he gave her back to him,\n\nwith gifts, and much money, and Hagar her handmaiden also.  And when Abraham arrived\nat the age of one hundred and forty-five years, he departed to God, Whom he loved, and he\ninherited the Garden of Delight and everlasting life.   And he left a memorial for good\nbehind him unto the end of the world.  Salutation to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\nAnd on this day also our fathers and doctors of the Church have commanded us to\ncelebrate the festival of the departure of Abba Isaac, the son of Abraham, the patriarch. \nThis righteous man was produced through the proclamation of God and His angels, by\nAbraham his father, and Sarah his mother.   And he finished his fight, and the work of\nrighteousness, and he was subject to God, the Most High, and to his father Abraham, and it\npleased his father to offer him up as a sacrifice to God, but God redeemed him by a goat. \nWe know not whether we are to wonder more at the willingness of his father Abraham to\nslay him, the child of promise, whom God gave him by Sarah when he was far advanced\nin years (now God said unto Abraham, “There shall be unto thee seed,” and yet he spared\nnot Isaac, through natural affection, because of his love for God, the Most High), or\nwhether we are to wonder (and we know not which is more wonderful) at the subjection of\nthis father Isaac, and his consenting to his father Abraham, even to his slaying him and\nburning him in the fire.  Now Isaac was a child, for the Book of the Law saith that his\nfather made him carry the wood to a place afar off, to the top of a mountain, but the Book\nof the Chronicle of Days saith that at that time the days of Isaac were seven and thirty\nyears.  And this father Isaac submitted to his father Abraham, and he stretched out his neck\nto the slaughtering knife, and the voice of the angel of God came and said unto him,\n“Stretch not out thy hand upon him, and do nothing evil to him.”   And as his father\nAbraham was called the “Sacrificer” of his son in his mind, even so was this father Isaac\ncalled the “Sacrifice” in his mind.  And great tribulation and much sorrow came upon him\nin his days, and he was a stranger to his country.  And Abimelech took his wife from him,\nand when God was wroth with him because of it, he gave her back to him, together with\nmuch money and gifts.   And this father was exceedingly simple in disposition, for the\nBook of the Law saith that when the shepherds quarreled together about a well of water,\nthis father left them, and went and dug other wells.  And he begot two sons, Esau and\nJacob, and he loved Esau because of his strength and might. And when he was far\nadvanced in days, and his eyes were feeble, he called his son Esau and said unto him, “I\nhave become old, O my son, go and hunt the wild animals of the desert, so that I may eat,\nand my soul shall bless thee.”  And Esau took his weapons, and went out into the desert. \nAnd Rebecca called Jacob and said unto him, “O my son, rise up and kill one of thy goats\nquickly and take it to thy father so that he may eat and bless thee before he dieth.”  And\nJacob said unto her, “I am afraid lest he shall know that I am Jacob, and lest he be angry\nwith me, for though I want to receive [his] blessing, a curse may come upon me instead of\na blessing.”  And she answered and said unto him, “Let thy curse be upon me, O my son.” \nAnd this took place through her by the command of God.  And Jacob did as his mother\ncommanded him, and he offered [food] to his father, and he ate and blessed him.  And this\nfather Abba Isaac arrived at the age of one hundred and eighty years, and he died in peace,\nand was buried in the grave of his father Abraham, which he bought from the sons of\n‘Emor and in which Sarah was buried.  Salutation to Isaac.\nAnd on this day also our fathers, the doctors of the Church, have commanded us to\ncelebrate the festival of the departure of Jacob the patriarch whom God called “Israel.” \nThis [righteous man] followed the examples of his fathers Abraham and Isaac in [the\npractice of] mercy, and in giving alms, and in sincerity and humility.  And his brother Esau\nhated him because he forestalled him, and bought from him his rights as the firstborn with\na meal of lentils; now Esau was the firstborn, and Jacob acted craftily towards him, and\nreceived the blessing from his father Isaac.  And when Esau threatened to kill Jacob, his\nfather Isaac advised him to go to the father of his mother’s brother, and he went there, and\nhe was betrothed to the daughter of his mother’s brother, and he tended his flocks for\nseven years, and he married her.  And then he was betrothed to the second daughter of his\nmother’s brother, and he served him for seven years, and also married her.   And his\nmother’s brother gave him a portion of his flocks, and it came to pass that when he said\nunto Jacob, “Let thy wages be the sheep which are all of one color,” the ewes brought\nforth only lambs which were all one color.  And when he said to Jacob, “Let thy wages be\n\nthe sheep which are spotted all over; thus his wages were doubled, and he had many\npossessions.  And he returned to the land of his father, and he begot twelve sons.  And he\nsaw the vision of a ladder on the earth which reached to heaven, and the angels of God\nwere ascending and descending on it.  And when he woke up he said, “This is the house of\nGod, and the door of heaven”; and that place became the Sanctuary in the city of\nJerusalem wherein was to be buried the body of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And then he saw a\nsecond vision, and it seemed as if God were contending with him, and He caused his hip to\nbe benumbed and He called him “Israel”; and because of this the Jews do not eat the\nmuscles of the hip.  And in his days came great tribulation and much sorrow.  First of all\n[his sons] sold his son Joseph as a slave to the Egyptians.  And their father asked them,\nsaying, “Where is your brother Joseph?”  And they said unto him, “The wild beasts have\ndevoured him”; and because of his excessive weeping Jacob’s eyes became blind.  And\nafter this there came a great famine in those days, and they found nothing to eat, and at\nlength Jacob sent his sons into the land of Egypt to buy grain.  And they came to Joseph\ntheir brother, who had become steward to the King of Egypt, and he knew that they were\nhis brothers, but they did not know that he was their brother Joseph.  And Joseph made a\npretence to them, and said unto them, “Depart and invite your father Jacob to come\nhither,” and they invited Jacob, and he came to the land of Egypt and dwelt there for\nseventeen years.  And when the time of his death had drawn nigh, he called his twelve\nsons, and blessed them, and he gave Judah sovereignty and made it known that Christ\nshould appear from him, and he blessed him with many words, saying, “The scepter of\nsovereignty shall not come to an end in Judah, and the rule shall not depart from before his\nhand until He, to Whom sovereignty belongeth, shall come, Him for Whom the nations\nwait.”  And after he had blessed him, Joseph brought to him his two sons Ephraim and\nManasseh, so that he might bless them, and he made the sign over their heads, and he laid\nhis right hand upon the head of the younger, and his left hand on the head of the elder, and\nhe made his hand [to take] the form of the Cross, indicating that the firstborn should be\nabased at the appearance of the Cross.  And he reached the age of one hundred and forty-\nsix years, and he died with the hands of Joseph resting on his eyes.   And Jacob\ncommanded him to bury him in the grave of his fathers, and Joseph mourned for him with\na great mourning, and the Egyptians with him.  And then he carried him on the chariots of\nPharaoh, and with him were the great nobles of the chariots of Pharaoh, and with him were\nthe great nobles of the Egyptians, and they brought him to the land of Canaan and buried\nhim with his fathers.  Salutation to Jacob.\nAnd on this day Abba Barsebu (Barsoba), and ten monks who were his disciples, and the\ncaptain of the royal horses, became martyrs by the hand of the King of Persia, and eight\nhundred companions of Isidore.  Salutation to Abba Barsebu.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and the king tortured him\ngreatly, but not only would he not deny Christ, but he increased his Faith in Him.  Then the\nking commanded the soldiers to cut off his head with the sword, and he likewise tortured\nthe two servants Garsimos and Theodotus severely, and he beat them and crucified them. \nAnd then the soldiers cut off the heads of all three of them with the sword, and the saints\nreceived crowns of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  And the believers gave\nmuch money to the soldiers, and the guards who were keeping the bodies, and they took\naway the bodies of the saints and wrapped them up in rich cloths, and laid them in coffins,\nand many signs and miracles appeared through them.  Salutation to Athanasius.\nAnd on this day also Saint Irenaeus, the Bishop of Sorem, became a martyr.  They seized\nthis saint at the first hour of the night, and brought him into the governor’s house, and the\ngovernor said unto him, “Sacrifice to the gods.”  And Irenaeus said unto him, “I will not\noffer sacrifice, for I am a fearer of God and I am His servant.”   And the governor\ncommanded the soldiers to drown him in the river, and when he had come to the ferry, he\nstripped off his apparel, and prayed to God to receive his soul, and to protect his people in\nSorem, and to give peace to the churches.  And then he said, “I believe in Thee, O my Lord\nJesus Christ, and I make supplication to Thee as I suffer,” and straightway they cast him\ninto the river.  Salutation to Irenaeus.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated the translation of the body of Abba John the Short\nto the desert of Scete; this took place after his death in Debra Kuelzem, which is the desert\nof Saint Abba Anthony.  And this happened in the days of Abba John, the forty-eighth\nArchbishop of the city of Alexandria, who went to the desert of Scete, and the holy monks\nsaid unto him, “We wish the body of Abba John the Short to be in the church of Abba\nMacarius, that we may bow down before it.”  And straightway the grace of God moved\nhim, and he wrote a letter [and sent it] by the hands of a certain abbot, whose name was\nCosmas, and with him was an elder of the country of Clysma.  And when they arrived they\nwere unable [to do anything], for at that time his body was in the charge of Chalcedonian\nMelchites, who were dwelling in that place.  And the abbot, and those who were with him,\nlearned and made certain where that place was, and they returned and found certain men\nwho were Orthodox believers dwelling in that city, and they told them the matter\nconcerning which they had come.  And after a few days a governor, who was one of the\nelders of the city, was appointed over Clysma, and he was a friend of Abba Michael,\nBishop of the city of Clysma.  And the archbishop wrote a letter to the bishop about the\nbody of Saint Abba John, and he commanded him to make plans, and to help his\nmessengers, the elder monks, so that they might be able to remove the body of the saint\nfrom the hands of the heretics.   And the bishop rejoiced with a great joy, and told the\nscribe of the governor, his friend, and the scribe told the governor about the letter of the\nelder monks.  And the scribe said, “How can we find an excuse for introducing the monks\ninto the cave of the place?”  And the governor said, “Let the monks put on over their own\napparel Arab garments, and let them come with us to that place”; and they did so.  And the\ngovernor departed having with him many people, and horsemen, and Arabs, and the elder\nmonks from the desert of Scete, and they came to Clysma.  And the governor spoke unto\n\nthe Malachite bishop who dwelt in that place, [saying,] “Send out all our men from the\nchurch, and let not one of them be left therein, for I wish to go into the church, and to\nremain there the whole night”; and the heretic did as the governor commanded.  And the\nelder monks made ready their beasts outside the city, and they came by night and took\naway the body of Abba John, and they departed and came to Mesr (Cairo), and hence they\ntraveled to the desert of Scete.  And the monks of the monastery of Abba Macarius went\nout and met them with crosses, and Gospels, and instruments of music, and incense, and\nsongs, and hymns.   And they brought Abba John to Saint Abba Macarius, and all the\nmonks were blessed by him; and they sprinkled many perfumes over him, and they\ncelebrated the Offering.  And at the time when the Gospel was being read a miracle which\nwas most marvelous was made manifest; the whole of the church was lighted up with\nheavenly light, and was filled with the odor of very sweet perfume, the like of which never\nwas.  And there was great joy.  And the saint remained in the monastery of Abba Macarius\nfor six days, and after this they took him and carried him to the church, and his sons the\nmonks received him as the Hebrews received our Redeemer, and they cried out before\nhim, saying, “Blessed is he who cometh in the Name of God.”  And they laid him in his\nplace, and signs and wonders took place through him.  And after the death of this Saint\nAbba John, Abba Mark the archbishop, who lived after him, went up to the desert of Scete,\nand he entered the church of Saint Abba John, and bowed low before him; and with him\nwere bishops, and many of the elders of the city of Alexandria, and of all the country of\nEgypt. And he uncovered the body of the saint and found it moist and hairy, and he was\nblessed by it and wept with a bitter weeping.  And when Abba Mark uncovered John’s\nbody, there was a loud clap of thunder in the church, and all the men fell in a state of terror\nand fear.  And the archbishop replaced the sackcloth covering over him, and then wrapped\nhim in fine linen.  And they carried away the saint, singing praises and a spiritual song,\nsaying, “O thou who wast a swift cloud, and didst bear rain, thou didst go to the country of\nBabylon, to the Three Children, and didst return to the city of Alexandria in the might of\nthe Holy Spirit, which was with thee.   And thou didst also go to Clysma, and didst\noverthrow the houses of idols, and didst preach the True Faith, and didst heal the sick, and\ndidst cast out devils, and didst return to thine inheritance; thou art a habitation of blessing,\nand a traveler to the kingdom of heaven.”  And the translation of the body of Abba John\nthe Short took place in the five hundred and twentieth year of the Holy Martyrs (A.D.\n804).  Salutation to the translation of thy body, O John the Short.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

[And I will rebuke] the caterpillar, and the worm,\nand the wire-worm, and the moth, so that they may not devour the fruits of your land.” \nAnd he prophesied concerning the coming of John the Baptist, before our Redeemer, and\nconcerning the coming of Elias before him, and also concerning the end of the world.  And\nhe prophesied concerning the habit of boasting among the Jews, and revealed to them that\nthere were [other] people on the earth, and priests and righteous men who offered up\nincense and sacrifices to God, which were accepted.  And having pleased God by his strife,\nand ended the days of his prophecy, he departed to God Whom he loved.\nAnd on this day also is celebrated the commemoration of Abba Moses, Bishop of the city\nof Farma.  Salutation to Moses, pillar of the city of Farma.\nAnd on this day also Andrew performed a miracle when our Lord appeared unto him in the\nform of the captain of a ship, and taught him the craft of a spirit ship.  And Andrew said\nunto our Lord, “Take me up into Thy ship, but we have no money [to pay] the ship’s fare. \nOur Lord commanded us not to carry gold and silver in our wallet.”  And our Lord said\nunto Andrew, “If it be thus, come up into My ship”; and Andrew and his disciples went up\ninto the ship.  And the Lord commanded one of the angels to bring three bread-cakes, and\nhe did so, and our Lord Jesus commanded Andrew, saying, “Rise up and eat ye bread so\nthat thou mayest be able to support the journey by sea”; and Andrew marveled.  And he\nsaid, “God give thee the bread of life in the kingdom of the heavens.”  And the disciples of\nAndrew could neither speak nor eat food through fear of the waves of the sea, and they\nwere not used to travel by sea.  And our Lord Jesus Christ said unto Andrew, “Tell thy\ndisciples to go back to the shore, for they appear to be timid, and if thou wilt not [do this],\nteach them with pleasant words [not] to be afraid--if thou art a disciple of God--for behold,\nthe ship is far from land”; and [then] the Lord Jesus departed, and sailed the ship.  And\nAndrew taught his disciples, and encouraged them, and prayed in his heart, and having\nprayed they fell into a heavy sleep; and Andrew rejoiced because of this.  Then Andrew\nturned to our Lord, and said unto Him, “Verily thou art a master-sailor!  Fourteen [times]\nhave I traveled by sea, and I never saw any man sail a ship as Thou dost.”  And our Lord\nJesus answered and said unto him, “When we sail on the sea we often suffer tribulation,\nbut since thou art a disciple of our Lord Jesus Christ, the sea recognizeth thee, and doth\nnot make its waves to rise up against thee.”  And Andrew cried out with a loud voice,\nsaying, “I bless Thee, O my Lord Jesus Christ, that I have spoken to a man who praiseth\nThee.”  And our Lord Jesus answered and said unto Andrew, “Tell me, O disciple of God,\nwhy do the Jews [not] believe that Jesus is the Son of God, for,” He continued, “we have\nheard that He hath performed many miracles.”   And Andrew said unto Him, “Yea, my\nbrother, He revealed unto us that He was God, and He performed miracles innumerable;\nHe opened the eyes of the blind, He made the lame to walk, He made the deaf to hear, He\nraised the dead, He cleansed the lepers, He turned water into wine, and He took five bread-\ncakes and two fishes, and having commanded the multitudes to sit down upon the grass,\nHe brake them, and of what was left over they gathered up many baskets full; yet, in spite\n\nof this, [the Jews] have not believed.”  And our Lord Jesus said unto him, “Doth He do this\nin public or in private?”  And Andrew said unto Him, “Some things He doeth publicly, and\nsome privately; but it seemeth to me that Thou art trying me.”  And the Lord Jesus said\nunto him, “Far be it from Me so to do!  Tell Me, O my brother, that My soul may rejoice.” \nAnd Andrew said unto Him, “O my son, may God fulfill for Thee every good work.  But\nnow hearken to a miracle, which the Lord performed when we, the Twelve Disciples, were\nwith Him, and likewise many of the chief priests, and many of the people.  We came unto\nthe synagogue, and our Lord saw two images, one on the right of the house, and one on the\nleft thereof.  And our Lord said, ‘Do ye see that there are similitude of the Cherubim and\nSeraphim in the heavens, which have been made by a man on earth?’  And He turned to\none image, and said unto it, ‘Unto thee, I speak, O similitude of heavenly beings which\nwas made by an artificer. . .come down from thy place, and revile the chief priests, and\ndeclare whether I be God or man.’  And straightway the image leaped down, and spoke\nlike a man, and said, ‘O ye foolish Jews, whose blindness is not enough for yourselves, but\nwho wish to make others blind, why do you say that He Who is God is a man?  This is He\nWho hath fashioned man in the beginning, and who gave him His own breath to breathe. \nThis is He Who made Abraham and Who brought back Jacob to his native land.  This is\nHe who giveth blessing unto those who call upon Him, and Who prepareth punishment for\nthose who do [not] submit to Him.  Verily I say unto you that ye have denied God, and\nhave changed the Law.  Behold, therefore, your synagogue shall be destroyed, and shall\nbecome a church in the Name of the Only Son of God.’  And having said these words and\nothers like unto them the image held its peace.  And we answered the chief priests and said\nunto them, ‘Behold, the image hath spoken unto you and reviled you.’   And the chief\npriests and the Jews said unto us, ‘this hath been done by magic.  The image spoke of\nAbraham, but where could it have found Abraham, for it is many days since Abraham\ndied.’  And the Lord Jesus turned to the image and said unto it, ‘they do not believe that I\nhave spoken to Abraham.  Go and say this to Abraham, “Thus saith He Who formed man\nat the creation, and Who made thee His friend:  Rise up, thou and Isaac and Jacob thy\nsons, and come forth!  Come ye and rebuke the chief priests and make them to know that\nye know Me.”’   And when the image heard these words it rose up, now we were all\nlooking on, and it went to the land of Canaan, to the grave of Abraham, and it stood up\noutside the tomb, and cried out as our Lord had told it [to do].   And straightway the\nTwelve Fathers came out from the tomb, and said unto the image, ‘Unto which of us wast\nthou sent?’  And the image answered and said unto them, ‘I was sent to the three fathers of\nthe people; as for you get ye back until the time of the Resurrection’; and when they heard\nthis they re-entered their tombs.  And the three fathers went with the image to the chief\npriests and the Jews, and they chided them, and told them that He was the Son of God. \nAnd then the Lord Jesus said unto the fathers, ‘Depart ye to your places and sleep.’  And\nagain He turned to the image and said unto it, ‘Return to thy place,’ and it went back to its\nplace, and became as it was before.  And although the chief priests saw this they did not\nbelieve.  Now there are very many other things which our Lord did, O my brother, and if I\nwere to begin to narrate them to thee I should never come to the end of the telling.”  And\nour Lord Jesus answered and said unto him, “I am able to complete the telling, and every\nhidden word, and every word of the Faith.  For the wise few words suffice, but if I were to\ntell them to the fool, his soul would not believe [them] until he died.”  And then when the\nship was approaching the coast and was nigh to arrive they held their peace.  Now whilst\nour Lord Jesus was talking to Andrew, He pretended to be sleepy, and He lay down and\nslept; and Andrew seeing Him lie down lay down himself and slept.  And our Lord Jesus\ncommanded the angels to take up and carry away Andrew and his disciples, and they went\nand laid them down outside the city where they wished [to be].  And when the day came,\nand Andrew woke up and opened his eyes, and saw the gates of the city, and knew that he\nwas on land, he was greatly frightened; and he woke up his disciples, and said unto them,\n“What did our Lord do unto us at sea?  We did not recognize Him, for He turned His face\ninto that of a man; it was He Who appeared unto us when He was giving us counsel.”  And\nthey said unto him, “Whilst we were asleep we saw our Lord sitting upon the throne of His\nglory, and all His angels were surrounding Him.  And we saw Abraham, and Isaac, and\nJacob, and all the saints, and David playing upon his harp and [other] instruments of\nmusic; and we saw the Twelve Apostles standing before our Lord, and there were twelve\n\nangels before Him, and many other angels behind Him.  And we heard the Lord saying\nunto the angels, ‘Hearken unto the Apostles in everything which they shall say unto\nyou.’”  And when Andrew heard this, he rejoiced greatly that his disciples were held to be\nworthy to see this wonderful thing.  And then he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and cried out\nwith a loud voice, saying, “O my Lord Jesus Christ, I knew that Thou wast not far from\nThy servants.  Forgive me, O my Lord, because that when I was talking to Thee on the\nship it seemed to me that Thou wast a man whom I could instruct.”  And our Lord Jesus\nappeared unto Andrew a second time, and He said unto him, “I am He Who appeared unto\nthee on the ship in the form of the captain of the ship, and I steered thee over the sea.  Fear\nnot, neither be dismayed, for I will be with thee.”  And having said these words He went\nup into heaven in great glory, and Andrew departed on his way.  Salutation to Andrew.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and the dedication of his church, which\nwas built to him on an island outside the city of Alexandria in the days of Saint Theophilus\nthe Archbishop; and the miracle which was made manifest therein, and took place thus.  A\ncertain rich woman from the city of Rome came to Saint Theophilus the Archbishop, and\nwith her were her son and a picture of the glorious Archangel Rufa’el (Raphael), and much\nmoney, which she had inherited from her parents.   And she cleared away the heap of\nrubbish, which was in front of the archbishop’s house, and there appeared from beneath it\na treasure of gold, even as we have written [in the section for] the eighteenth day of\nTekemt.   And Saint Abba Theophilus built many churches, and among them was the\nchurch, which was on the island outside the city of Alexandria, and was dedicated in the\nname of the glorious Archangel Rufa’el (Raphael); and Abba Theophilus the Archbishop\nfinished the building thereof and consecrated it as it were this day.   And whilst the\nbelievers were praying in the church, behold the church trembled, and was rent asunder,\nand it moved about.  And they found that the church had been built upon the back of a\nwhale of the whales of the sea, on which a very large mass of sand had heaped itself.  Now\nthe whale lay firmly fixed in its place, and the treading of the feet of the people upon it cut\nit off from the mainland; and it was Satan who moved the whale so that he might throw\ndown the church.   And the believers and the archbishop cried out together, and made\nsupplication to the Lord Christ, and they asked for the intercession of the glorious\nArchangel Rufa’el (Raphael).  And God, the Most High, sent the glorious angel Rufa’el\n(Raphael), and he had mercy on the children of men, and he drove his spear into the while,\nsaying unto him, “By the commandment of God stand still, and move not thyself from thy\nplace”; and the whale stood in his place and moved not.  And many signs and wonders\nwere made manifest, and great healings of sick folk took place in that church.  And this\nchurch continued to exist until the time when the Muslims reigned, and then it was\ndestroyed, and the whale moved, and the sea flowed back again and drowned many people\nwho dwelt in that place.\nThis story was told by John, Archbishop of the city of Constantinople, to Honorius, the\nrighteous emperor.  And he said unto him, “Know, O emperor, that we were sailing in a\nship to come to thee, and as we were going along we saw a church, on the island, on the\nday preceding the Sabbath, and we came into port, so that we might received the Holy\nMysteries on the First Day of the week.  And we found a little monastery by the side of the\nchurch, with brethren and monks therein.  And, by the commandment of God, we went to\nthem, and we said unto them, ‘O brethren, if ye have with you an old manuscript treating\nof the days of the ancients, give it to us so that we may comfort ourselves therewith.’  And\nthey answered and said unto me, ‘Behold, we have many manuscripts in the sanctuary, but\nwe do not know how to translate them.’  And I said unto them, ‘Bring them here that I may\nsee them.’  And when they brought them to me, I searched through them, and I found that\nthey treated of the mighty deeds and miracles which our Lord Jesus Christ had performed\nbefore His disciples, and also of the beginning of the heavens and the earth, and [they went\non] to the end of this world.   And as I was examining these manuscripts, I found a\nmanuscript which was written by our fathers, the holy Apostles, and which treated of the\nappointment of the Seven Archangels, and it said:  ‘When our Lord Jesus Christ was on\nthe Mount of Olives with His disciples, He revealed to them the mystery of the Godhead.’ \nAnd the Apostles asked Him, saying, ‘O our Lord and God, we beseech and entreat Thee\nto tell us about the glory of the honorable angel Rufa’el (Raphael), and what day Thou\ndidst appoint him, and in what month, and whether he is the equal of his fellow\narchangels, so that we may preach him in the world, and that men may celebrate a festival\nin his honor as they celebrate festivals in honor of his fellow archangels, and that men may\n\npray to him in the time of their sorrow and tribulation, so that they may find grace and\ncompassion with Thee, and his intercession.’   And straightway our Lord Jesus Christ\ncommanded, and the seven, and the three archangels, came from the third heaven,\nMichael, and Gabriel and Rufa’el (Raphael) with great joy, and they bowed down before\nour Lord Christ:  and our Lord said unto the angel Rufa’el (Raphael), ‘Tell the Apostles\nthy name so that they may know thy great honor.’  Now the Archangel Rufa’el (Raphael),\na sincere (?) angel, is the third of the archangels, and Michael the archangel is the first of\nall the angels; and his name [meaneth] the ‘compassionate.’  And Gabriel is the second\narchangel, and his name [meaneth] ‘God and man,’ and it was he who was sent to our holy\nLady, the Virgin Mary, to announce the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ from her.”  And\nRufa’el (Raphael) said, “I make hearts to rejoice, and I am sincere, and good, and merciful\nto sinners, against whom I never lay information concerning their sins before God; I speak\nonly of my power to save, and my sincerity, and my love for men.  I send angels with the\nsouls of sinners, and I treat them with long-suffering until at length they repent of their\nsins, and forsake their transgressions, I am Rufa’el (Raphael) whom God set over the\ntwenty-three hosts of angels, [and] we praise God the Father, and His compassionate Son,\nand the Holy Spirit the Comforter.  I am Rufa’el (Raphael) whom God commanded to give\ngood things to the saints at the Marriage of One Thousand Years in Mount Zion, when our\nLord Jesus Christ made them to drink out of the cup, which is filled with honor indeed, as\nthey reclined with Him when He sat on the holy throne.  I am Rufa’el (Raphael) whom\nGod commanded to take up branches of the Tree of Life in my hand, and to give them to\nChristians on that day [of] life and joy.  I am Rufa’el (Raphael) under whose hands are\nkept the treasure houses of the heavens, and I open them and shut them according as God\ncommandeth me.   And if any man shall do a good deed to another man, who is in\ntribulation upon earth, for my name’s sake, or shall write a book about my office, or shall\nremember any of the poor in my name, or shall offer up an offering or incense on the day\nof my commemoration, which is the third day of Paguemen, whereon God appointed me,\nand crowned me with the office of the angels, I will bear them and transport them on the\nchariot of light, until they enter the heavenly Jerusalem.  And I will place in their souls\nscented branches with an exceedingly sweet odor, the like of which shall never be found\nupon the earth.  Ask of me, O chosen Apostles, at all times so that I may protect you until\nye stand before God.  And preach ye unto all men in all the world that they must celebrate\nmy commemoration, and I will make intercession with God on their behalf, and I will\ndeliver them from their tribulation, and they shall never see punishment.”  And having said\nthese words Rufa’el (Raphael) bowed low to the Lord.  And this glorious angel Rufa’el\n(Raphael), the archangel, hath performed many miracles, and it is meet that we should\ncelebrate his commemoration at all times, for he maketh intercession with God on our\nbehalf.  Salutation to Rufa’el (Raphael).\nAnd on this day is celebrated the death of Melchisedek.  This man was the son of Kainan,\nthe son of Shem.  And when he was fifteen years of age God commanded Noah to send\nShem his son with the body of our Father Adam, and to lay it in the middle of the earth,\nwhich is called “Keranyo” (Place of Skull); and he informed him that the Savior of the\nworld would come, and that they would sacrifice Him there, and that He would redeem\nAdam by His Blood.  And Shem and Melchisedek took the body of Adam from the house\nof his father in secret, and he went there, and the angel of God guided them; and\nMelchisedek was appointed priest.  And he took twelve stones and offered up an offering\nupon them, with bread and wine which came down to him from heaven, and which\nrevealed the mystery of the new Law.  And the angels used to bring food unto him from\nheaven, and his apparel consisted of a hide, and a hide girdle, and he continued to minister\nbefore the body of our father Adam.  And when Abraham returned from the war, and had\nvanquished the kings, he offered him bread and wine, and Abraham gave him tithes of all\nhis possessions, and he was appointed priest and king of Salem.   Salutation to\nMelchisedek.\nAnd on this day also died Serapion of Landun.  This saint was learned in the Books of the\nChurch, and in the interpretation of the same, and he renounced all the possessions of this\nworld.  And then he went and departed into the country of the pagans, and sold himself for\ntwenty dinars, and he took care of his dinars.  He ate nothing but bread and water, and he\n\nused to pray to God to turn [the people] from their error;

And they sent to her a\nmessage, saying, “If thou wishest to see us in the generation which is for ever, depart from\nthis place”; and she understood, and accepted [their words], and departed.  And this father\nwas a haven and a comforter of the old men and of the young men of the desert of Scete. \nAnd whenever tribulation, and doubt about the Faith, or a temptation of the Adversary\n[assailed any one of them], he would come to him, and our father would comfort him, and\nstraightway he was cured of his sickness.  And this father composed works on Doctrine,\nand many Homilies, and profitable Admonitions on piety, and the spiritual fight, and the\npath of the monastic life.  And he said in his teaching, “If thou seest a brother who hath\ntransgressed, despair not of him, but wake up his soul, and comfort him, and lighten his\nheaviness, so that he may rise up from his fall.”  And he also saith, “Teach thy heart so that\nit may do what thy tongue sayeth.”  And one of the brethren said unto him, “If I see a\nbrother who is good, I rejoice in him, and bring him into my abode, and make him to\nrejoice.  And also, if I see a brother whose works are inferior I do not wish to bring him\ninto my abode.”  And Abba Baymon answered and said unto him, “If thou treatest well the\nbrother who is good, thou must treat that brother whose works are inferior with a double\nportion of goodness, for he who is sick needeth healing especially.”  And then he informed\nthat brother who was talking with him, saying, “There was a monk in the monastery whose\nname was Timothy, and he fell into sin, and he was always weeping; and he wept, and\ngroaned, and petitioned God, saying, ‘O Lord, I have sinned against Thee; forgive me.’ \nAnd a voice came to him and said unto him, I will only cast thee off when thou despisest\nthy brother in the time of his trial.”  And this father Abba Baymon also said, “If we cover\nover the sins of our brethren, God will cover over our sins.”  And this holy father lived all\nhis days a life of spiritual fighting, and devotion to God, and he arrived at a good old age\nand pleased God and died in peace.   Salutation to thee, O mortal tongue of the seven\nbrethren who refused to see their mother.\nOn this day also died Liberius, Archbishop of the city of Rome.  This holy father was\nappointed over the city of Rome in the days of Kuenesta (Constantine), the son of\nKuenesta (Constantine).   And Kuenesta (Constantine) having driven his brother, the\napostolic Saint Athanasius, from the throne of the city of Alexandria, and having also\ndriven out Paul, Archbishop of the city of Constantinople, the two of them came to this\nfather Liberius and asked him to help them.  And he received them and brought them to\nthe Emperor Kuenesta (Constantine), and he wrote for them from himself a letter to his\nbrother Kuenesta (Constantine), and commanded him to receive them.  And he wrote for\nthem a letter to his brother Kuenesta (Constantine) that he might help them.  And when the\nEmperor Kuenesta (Constantine) read the letter of his brother Kuenesta (Constantine), and\nthe letter of this holy father Liberius, he received them, and set them upon their thrones as\nbefore.   And when Kuenesta (Constantine) was killed in the city of Rome, Kuenesta\n(Constantine) sent to this Saint Liberius, and asked him to help him, and to drive the\napostolic Athanasius out of the city of Alexandria, and to receive the Arians, and he made\nhim many promises.  But Liberius did not accept this petition, and he would come to no\n\nagreement with him, and the emperor banished him to a remote region; and then he sent\nand slew the murderer of his brother.  And after this he went to the city of Rome, and with\nhim were the heads of the monasteries and the chief priests, and they begged him to make\nthis father Liberius to come back from exile to his archiepiscopal throne in the city of\nRome; and he accepted their petition, and commanded him to return to his office.  And\nhaving returned to his archiepiscopal throne, this father taught always his flock to be\nstrong in the True Faith.   And he composed many Homilies and Admonitions, and he\nresisted the followers of Arius, and excommunicated them, and drove them out until he\ndied; and he sat on his archiepiscopal throne for seven years.  Salutation to Abba Liberius\nthe Archbishop.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and assuredly he would also do good to her in the world which is to come,\nand make intercession for her before our Lord Jesus Christ.   And that night the saint\nappeared unto the judge, her husband, in the prison house, and a great light rose upon him,\nuntil the whole house was lighted up.   Then he saw Saint Laventius in the form of a\nhorseman, and light was shining from him, and as he stood by him in the prison house,\narrayed in cloth of gold, the judge knew that this cloth of gold was his own apparel.  And\nSaint Laventius, the horseman, said unto the judge, “Grieve not, neither be sorrowful, for\nthou shalt be delivered to-morrow, and thou shalt eat with the emperor at his table, and\nthou shalt go to thy house.”  And the judge was amazed at the many things which he saw\nthat horseman do, and at the light which rose over him, and at his coming in to him in the\nprison house, [the doors] being shut, and at [the sight of] his own cloth of gold which he\nhad left in his house.  And Saint Laventius hid himself (i.e. disappeared), and went to the\nemperor that night.  And he struck the emperor with his foot twice and thrice.  And the\nEmperor Diocletian woke up, and when he saw Saint Laventius, he was afraid and was\ngreatly terrified.  And Saint Laventius said unto him, “When the morning hath come, bring\nout so and so, the judge, from the prison house, and do him honor, and let him go to his\nhouse, lest thou die an evil death and be destroyed.”  And the emperor trembled before\nhim, and answered and said unto him, “Yea, my lord, everything which thou commandest\nme [to do] I will do.”  And when it was morning, the emperor sent and brought the judge\nout of the prison house, and he paid him great honor, and arrayed him in splendid apparel,\nand he made him to sit at meat at his own table, and he told him how the horseman had\nappeared unto him.   And the judge was silent, and marveled exceedingly; now the king\nsaw that Saint Laventius was an angel.  And the judge answered, and said unto him, “I\nknow nothing whatsoever about all which thou sayest, and I do not know who it was that\nappeared unto thee”; and the emperor did not dare to speak to him one word of abuse, but\nhe sent him to his own city, with great honor, because of his fear of him that had appeared\nunto him.  And as the judge was journeying along the road, the angel of God in the form of\nSaint Laventius appeared unto him, and held converse with him, and he comforted him\nuntil he arrived in his own city of Tarablos; then he hid himself (i.e. disappeared) from him\nstraightway.  And the judge went into his house, and he embraced the men of his house,\nand told them how that horseman had appeared unto him in the prison house, arrayed in\ncloth of gold, and how he had promised him that he would deliver him from the prison\nhouse, and how he had brought him out of his bondage in the morning, and how the\nhorseman had appeared unto him on the road wearing the cloth of gold.  And his wife, who\nknew that the horseman was Laventius, answered, and said unto him, “Yea.”  Then she\ntook him into the shrine, to the picture of Saint Laventius, and as soon as he saw it he said,\n“Verily this is he who appeared unto me.”  Then she opened the coffer wherein was the\nbody of Saint Laventius, and he saw him wearing his cloth of gold; and he opened the\nwrapping of his face, and he knew that it was he who had appeared unto him and delivered\n\nhim.  And the judge asked his wife about the saint, and he said unto her, “Who is he?” \nAnd she told him the history of the saint.  And the judge praised his wife for what she had\ndone and he glorified God the Most High and Glorious, Who worketh miracles for His\nsaints.  Then he commanded his wife to burn incense, and to keep a [lighted] lamp before\nhim, and she continued to do this until God destroyed Diocletian, the infidel.  And they\nbuilt a church for the saint, and they translated his body thereto, and they laid him in it,\nand they consecrated the church as it were this day;

After this he brought a\nsorcerer from ‘Akmim, and he concocted a magical drink for him wherein poison was\nmixed, and commanded Hilarion (sic) to drink it.  And the saint having made over it the\nsign of the Cross drank it, and no harm came to him.  When the governor was tired of\ntorturing him, he commanded the soldiers to cut off his head with the sword, and they cut\noff his head with the sword; and he received the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of\nheaven.  And the sorcerer also believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, and received the crown\nof martyrdom in the kingdom of heaven.  Salutation to Sanusi, and to Maria, and to the\nSorcerer.\nAnd on this day also John, of the city of ‘Arakli, became a martyr.  The father of this saint\nwas Zacharias, governor of the city of ‘Antarsen and ‘Albia, and the name of his mother\nwas “Elisabeth.”   And when they were blessed with this boy, on the fifth day of this\nmonth, they called his name “John”; for his father and his mother both wished him to have\nthe name of John, who baptized the Lord.  And they brought him up in the admonition and\nfear of God, and they taught him the Books of the Church, and the knowledge of numbers,\nand all kinds of philosophy.  His mother watched over him carefully all his days so that he\nshould not step aside from the path of God, and his father also admonished him.  After this\nhis father died, when the young man was twenty years old, and he became judge in his\nfather’s place, and all the countries of Pontus, and Harakli, and other cities continued to be\nunder his authority.  Whilst matters were thus, Satan appeared unto him in the form of an\nangel, and said unto him, “Thus saith God:  Go thou to the city of Antioch and marry the\ndaughter of Numerianus the king, so that thou thyself mayest reign, and may sit with him\nupon the same throne.”  And the saint pondered and said, “Is this an angel [of God] or an\nangel of Satan?  As, however, I heard the Name of God from his mouth I will go to the city\nof Antioch”; and then he went and met Diocletian, who loved him and paid him honor\nfrom the day he saw him.   And on the following day, when they were sitting at meat\ntogether, the wicked Diocletian ordered his servants to bring in Apollo, and they brought\nhim in before him.  When the saint saw him, he made a motion of contempt at the idol, and\nhe cursed the emperor and hated him for this.  When Diocletian saw what the saint had\ndone, he was filled with very great wrath, and he bound John in prison.  And whilst John\n\nwas in prison, our Lord appeared unto him in a chariot of light; now there were angels\nwith Him, and He took him, and kissed him mouth to mouth, and promised him many\nthings.  On the following day Diocletian sent and brought him out of prison, and said unto\nhim, “Come and worship Apollo and Artemis”; and the saint refused to do so, saying,\n“How can I worship the work of the hand?”  And the emperor spoke many persuasive\nwords unto him, and he wished to be rid of him.  Then he sent him to the country of Egypt,\ngiving him power to levy taxes.  And Diocletian sent a letter concerning him to Soryakos,\nthe governor of Egypt, saying, “I have given power to John, the Haraklian, over all the\ntaxes from Jerusalem to Ethiopia, and let the people pull down the temples and destroy\nthem utterly.”  And the saint accepted this pretence and pulled down the temples, and left\nthem in ruins.  One day after this Soryakos, the governor, sat on the tribune in order to\ncommand the cutting off of the heads of the martyrs.  And straightway there came men\nfrom Upper Egypt called Dioscoros, and Bifamon, and Harganus, and Kiros, and Julius,\nand Alexander, and Joseph, and Isaac, and Stephen, and they cried out boldly, “We are\nChristians”; and straightway the governor was wroth, and he tortured them without\nsparing.  And when Saint John saw this, he abandoned the office of his judgeship, and\ncried out boldly, “I am a Christian.”  And the governor was wroth, and commanded the\nsoldiers to bind him with iron fetters, and then he sent him to Arianus, the governor of\nEnsna, who questioned him about all that had happened.  When he heard John’s words, he\nwas wroth and commanded the soldiers to hang him on the henbaz, and to break him on\nthe iron wheel.  Then he commanded them to take him off the henbaz, and to beat him on\nhis belly and head until his flesh melted, and the earth was soaked with his blood; and they\ncast him into prison.  A few days after this he commanded them to hack his body in pieces\nwith hatchets, and then he commanded them to bring a piece of sackcloth made of hair,\nand to drag it over his wounds; and they also sprinkled hot ashes and coals of fire under\nhis back.  And he also commanded them to bring pegs of iron, which had been heated, in\nthe fire, and to lay them on his face, and to drive them through his ears; and when they had\ndone this they cast him into prison.  That night the angel of God appeared unto him and\ngave him peace.   And on the following day the governor had him brought out and he\ntortured him with red-hot bars of iron.  After all this, they bound his hands and his feet\nwith cords, and they tied him on to the back of a horse with his face turned downward\ntowards the earth.  Then the executioner came and cut off his hands, and feet, and head,\nwith the sword; and he treated the two other men who were with him in like manner.  Thus\nthe saint finished his martyrdom and his good fight.  Salutation to John, and to those who\nwere martyred with him.  Salutation to Bifamon, and to his brethren, and to his mother.\nAnd on this day also became martyrs ‘Akronius, and Dimunasia, his sister, and ‘Amoni\nand Mina, the Egyptians and soldiers of the Emperor Diocletian.  When the emperor cast\nthese saints into a pit of fire along with Abba ‘Ebsoy, the angel Gabriel came and brought\nthem forth from the flames.  And when the saints came before the emperor, they cursed\nhim and said unto him, “Why dost thou delay day after day, and dost not bring to an end\nour matter?”  When the emperor heard this he was wroth, and he commanded the soldiers\nto cut off their heads with a sharp sword, and to burn their bodies in the fire; [and they did\nso,] and thus the saints finished their martyrdom, and kept the festival with the righteous in\nthe kingdom of heaven.   Salutation to ‘Akronius, and to Dimunasia, his sister, and to\n‘Amoni, and to Mina.\nAnd on this day also became martyrs the pure Saint Sophia, the strenuous fighter, and her\nbrother Ammonius in the days of Diocletian, the infidel.  This holy woman had Christian\nparents, and having begotten her, they brought her up very carefully in the fear of God,\nand they taught her the Books of the Church, and all the Law of the Apostles.  When she\nreached woman’s estate, they wanted to give her in marriage to a certain nobleman of the\ncity.  When the saint of God knew this she rose up from where she was sitting, and turned\nher face towards the East, and made one hundred prostrations and stood up and prayed for\na long time.  And she said in her prayer, “O my Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Living\nGod, Whose glory is great, guide Thou Thine handmaiden Sophia in Thy right path, so that\nI may come to Thee, and let me not stray into the crooked path which leadeth to\ndestruction.  And also let not my heart think about the corrupt way of the world, and all the\ndesire for fornication, which my parents are planning for me.  O my Lord, abandon not\n\nThine handmaiden so that she become a sinner, and permit me not to devote myself to, and\nto shoulder the heavy load of the lust of this world, but let my neck bow beneath and bear\nthe easy yoke of Thy commandments.”   And after she had finished her prayer, she sat\ndown on her bed, and waited a little, and a thought came into her mind which said, “I will\narise and flee secretly, and I will go far away, and enter the innermost part of a certain\ndesert, and will devote my life to the Most High.”  And when she had finished her thinking\nshe called the servant whom her parents had given to her to be her handmaiden, and she\ncommanded her to bring her some wine, intending to make her drink it; and the\nhandmaiden brought wine, and also brought a little food.  And Sophia commanded the\nhandmaiden to drink of the wine, which she brought until it was finished, and she did so. \nAnd the mind of the handmaiden being carried away by the headiness of the wine Sophia\nsaid unto her, “Bring me thy apparel, and take mine”; and the handmaiden gave it to her. \nThen Sophia commanded her to sleep until she had recovered from the headiness of the\nwine, and when she had fallen into a heavy sleep, Sophia went out secretly, and none saw\nher, for her chamber was far from her parents’ part of the house.  And having departed she\narrived at a certain road, and found there people who were fleeing from Diocletian because\nof the Faith; and they were seeking to hide themselves in the mountains and caves.  And\nshe answered and said unto them, “Whence come ye?”  And each man told her [the name\nof] his city.   And she said unto them, “Whither go ye?”   And they told her all that\nhappened because of Diocletian and because of the Faith.  And she said unto them, “Is\nthere anyone who will bring me along this road to Diocletian?”  And they said unto her,\n“Yea.”  And she went on a little way further, and prayed a long prayer, and she went on,\nand arrived at the place where Diocletian was, and confessed our Lord Jesus Christ.  And\nwhen Diocletian heard the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, he was filled with wrath, and he\ncommanded his soldiers to bring her before him.   When she came he said unto her,\n“Worship Apollo,” and she said unto him, “How can I worship the work of man’s hand,\nunclean idols?”  And forthwith Diocletian was wroth, and he commanded them to beat her\nwith iron rods (?), and to place a large stone on her head, and to drag her over the sand\nuntil her flesh was torn into shreds; and then he cast her into prison.  On the following day\nhe ordered them to bring her out, and he said unto her, “Offer sacrifice to Apollo that thou\nmayest not die an evil death.”  And she answered and said unto him, “It may seem to be an\nevil death to thee, but for me my death through thee will be life with my God.”  And he\nsaid unto her, “Is there any life left for thee after I have put thee to death?”   And she\nanswered and said unto him, “O fool, leave me; even for thee there is resurrection.  But thy\nresurrection is for judgment, with thine idols.”  And when he heard this he was furiously\nangry, and he commanded them to beat her with rods of iron until all the bones of her body\nwere broken; and they did as he commanded.  And he commanded them to lay her upon a\nbed of iron and to light a fire under her, and they did so, and when evening fell on the land\nhe commanded them to cast her into prison.  That night the angel of God came to her, and\ntouched her, and healed her.  And on the following day the emperor commanded them to\nbring her [to him], and she came walking upon her feet, and she felt as if she had been\nwashed in the bathhouse, and had come forth anointed with unguent.  When Diocletian\nsaw her walking on her feet, he said, “Observe ye the strength of the medicine of this\nChristian woman; yesterday I tortured her with fire, and to-day she is whole.”  And Saint\nSophia said unto him, “I know nothing of medicine, but my God is the master of\nmedicines.”  And straightway the emperor persuaded her to consent, and when she refused\nhe ordered the soldiers to cut off her head.  And as they were carrying her away to cut off\nher head, our Lord Jesus Christ appeared unto her and promised her many things.  And He\nsaid unto her, “Whosoever shall celebrate thy commemoration, or shall give alms in thy\nname, or shall write the history of thy strife, I will receive in the kingdom which is in the\nheavens.”  After this they cut off her head with the sword, and she received the crown of\nmartyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  Salutation to Amon, and to Sophia.\nAnd on this day also became [martyrs] Bifamon, and ‘Azenhas.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

now he was an Arian, and he commanded, and also closed the\nchurches of the True Faith, and at length the men of the True Faith entered the evil Faith. \nNow this Edict came into all the country of his dominions.  And by the grace of the Holy\nSpirit, the heart of this holy man waxed hot, and he rose up and went to the city of\nConstantinople, and he found the emperor ready to set out on an expedition to fight his\nenemies who had risen up against him in the region of the West.  And this saint stood up\nbefore him, and said unto him, “I ask thee to open the churches to the believers, that they\nmay pray for thee, and then God shall help thee against thine enemies; but if thou wilt not\ndo this behold God shall cast thee away, and thou shalt flee before thine enemies.”  And\nthe emperor was wroth, and commanded the soldiers to beat him and to bind him in\nprison.  And the saint said unto him, “Know that thou shalt flee before thine enemies, and\nthou shalt die in a blazing fire.”  And the emperor delivered him over to one who was to\nkeep him under guard until he should return in safety, as he expected.  And Saint Jacob\nsaid unto him, “If thou returnest in safety, then hath not God spoken by my mouth”; when\nthe holy man said this they took him, and beat him, and bound him in prison, and the\nemperor departed to fight against his enemies.  And as he stood up with his soldiers facing\nhis enemies, the Son of God the Creator, Who is equal with God His Father, Whom he had\ndenied, and he had also helped the followers of Arius in their prayers, cast him away, and\nhe fled from before his enemies.  And they pursued him until he came to a certain village,\nwhich they set on fire, and his men fled, and he was left behind, and he and all those who\nbelieved the evil Faith were burned in the fire.  And all those of his soldiers who were left\nturned and fled to the city of Constantinople; and they told the believers this good news,\nand thus the prophecy of the holy man was fulfilled.  And the believers assembled, and\nbrought this saint out of prison with great honor, and both the believers and the\nunbelievers knew that the divine grace and the spirit of prophecy dwelt on this saint.  And\nmany of the Arians turned to the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, and they bowed down at\nthe feet of the saint, and they confessed that the Son of God is equal with the Father in His\nGodhead.  And after this the holy father lived as he had done before in devotion to the\nascetic life, and in fighting the spiritual fight; and he died in peace and received the crown\nof everlasting life.  Salutation to Jacob from the East.\nAnd on this day Abba ‘Ebsoy, the fighter, became a martyr.  This chosen man and fighter\nhad Christian parents, and they served our Lord Christ, and kept His commandments; the\nname of his father, who was from Antioch, and was governor of Kaw in Upper Egypt, was\n“Tagestas,” and the name of his mother was “Karisa.”  They lived for sixteen years, having\nno son, and they were very sad because of this.  One night a shining man appeared unto\nTagestas, and said unto him, “Peace be unto thee, O lover of God, behold thy prayer hath\nbeen heard by God.  And behold thy wife shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his\nname ‘’Ebsoy.’   And he shall be a chosen vessel of God, and shall be a witness (i.e.\nmartyr) of our Lord Jesus Christ, and he shall be a great martyr, and shall suffer much\ntorture, and shall receive the crown of life”; and Tagestas told his wife what he had seen. \nAnd after a few days, she conceived, and bore a son on the fourth day of the month of\nMiyazya, and she brought him up in the knowledge, and wisdom, and the fear of God. \nWhen he was six years old his parents sent him away to the country of ‘Akmim and they\ngave him to a certain teacher, an elder, whose name was Joseph; and he dwelt there and,\nwith his brother Peter, devoted himself to fasting and prayer, and he performed signs and\nwonders.  When he was sixteen years old, the governor of Upper Egypt came to the city of\n\nKaw, and he persecuted and killed many believers.   Then certain evil men came and\ninformed against these saints Abba ‘Ebsoy, and Abba Peter, saying to the governor, “They\nare deacons who do not submit to thy words, and they refuse to worship the gods.”  And\nstraightway the governor commanded his soldiers to bring them and set them [before him],\nand he questioned them about all their affairs; and having heard their words he\ncommanded them to shut them up in prison.   After three months, the angel of God\nappeared unto them and said, “I am Gabriel, the announcer of glad tidings.  God hath sent\nme to you to tell you that your memorial shall endure forever.  As for thee, my beloved\n‘Ebsoy, a great conflict awaiteth thee. They shall take thee to the city of Alexandria, and\nthence to Antioch, and there thou shalt finish thy testimony.”   After this the governor\nbrought him out of prison, and urged him to worship idols, and when the saint refused to\ndo so, he ordered the soldiers to put him upon the henbaz, and they crushed him severely;\nand then the Archangel Gabriel descended and smashed the henbaz, and touched his flesh\nand healed him.  Then the emperor cast him into prison, where he healed many.  Then the\ngovernor commanded them to bring him out of prison and to fetter him in the hold of the\nship, and they tied iron chains about his neck, and put irons on his hands and feet, and they\ngave him no bread; in this state he remained for ten days.   On the following day they\nbrought him out, and set him before the governor, who said unto him, “Worship the gods,”\nand when he refused to do so the governor ordered them to torture him.  And they mounted\nAbba ‘Ebsoy upon the henbaz, and they crushed him until his blood flowed like water; and\nthen they shut him up in prison.  Whilst he was there the Archangel Gabriel again appeared\nunto him and said, “Be strong, ‘Ebsoy, O chosen one of God, and fear not, for I will be\nwith thee until thou finishest thy contest.”   After this they brought him to the city of\nAlexandria, to Diocletian, the governor, and he also questioned him about his case; and he\ncommanded the soldiers to beat him until his members fell upon the ground.  And after\nthis they boiled pitch over the fire, and poured it into his ears and mouth, and throat (?),\nand the governor commanded them also to light torches and to burn his sides therewith. \nAnd he also commanded them to bring red-hot borers and to thrust them into his eyes, and\nalso to pluck out the nails of his hands and feet, and to tear out his bowels; and they did\neven so.  And straightway the Archangel Gabriel came and touched his limbs, and healed\nhim.  Then they brought him before Diocletian, and he also tortured him with fire, and\n[boiling] pitch, and sulfur, and vine-wood; and then the Archangel Gabriel delivered him. \nAnd the governor also commanded them to cast him into the sea, with a large stone\nfastened to his neck with an iron chain.  And they rolled the stone down into the sea, and\nthe stone, which was tied to his neck, dragged down one-half of his body, and the half of\nhis body, which was not submerged, they tied to the top of a high pillar which they set up\non the sea-shore; and they left him there to suffer this torture until the sixth hour of the\nday.  And after this the angel of God came down and made his sides whole as before. \nWhen the emperor saw this he marveled, and he said unto the headsman, “Make haste and\ncut off his head”; and straightway he cut off his head, which he made to fall on the\nseashore.  And he took his body, and his head, and threw them into a skin, and his head\njoined to his body, and it became as if it had never been cut off; and the skin set off by\nitself, no man carrying it, and after ten days it arrived at the city of Alexandria.  And when\nthe men of the city of Boha heard of this, they came and brought him to his house in the\ncity of Boha, and they buried him with Peter his brother.  Salutation to Abba ‘Ebsoy of the\ncity of Boha.\nAnd on this day also Saint Bifamon became a martyr.  This holy man was the son of the\nbrother of the father of John of Harakli, and he helped him and ministered unto him whilst\nhe was in prison.  When John finished his martyrdom, he prepared him for burial, and he\nwept over his dead body, saying, “Why hath he left me alone, a stranger to the grace of\nGod?”  And a voice went forth from the body of John, saying, “O my beloved Bifamon, if\nthou wishest to depart with me, go quickly to the governor, and confess Christ, and to-\nmorrow morning thou wilt come to me.”   And Bifamon ran and reviled Arianus, and\ncursed his gods, and after the governor had tortured him severely, he cut off his head with\nthe sword, and Bifamon received the crown of martyrdom.\nAnd on this day also Saint Mercurius, and Feg (Aflagius), and Eblag (‘Ablawig), and\nIsaac, and Ablarius, became martyrs.  And on this day also Saint Mark became a martyr\n\nfor Christ’s Name, by drowning.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

[Here is] one of the miracles of this Saint Abba ‘Abaskiron.  There was\na church in a certain village in the north of Egypt, and the priests of that church were\ncommitting evil deeds; and the saint waited for them to turn from their wickedness, but\nthey neither repented of it nor turned from it.  And the saint entreated God, Who brought\nupon them the disease of the plague, and they all died at once.  And the saint departed,\nriding upon a horse, and he arrived at a city the name of which was Beyahu, in Upper\nEgypt, at the time when men sleep, and when the men of the city were talking together by\nthe light of the moon before they went to sleep.  And the saint came to them, riding upon a\nhorse, and he said unto them, “Peace be unto you”; and as soon as they saw him they rose\nup straightway, and they welcomed him, and they said unto him, “Peace be to thee, O our\nlord.”  and he said unto them, “I wish ye to give me a little piece of ground,” and making a\nline on the earth with his spear he said, “This will be enough for me.”   And the men\n\nanswered and said unto him, “Yea, our lord, as thou commandest us so shall it be”; and he\ngave them one hundred dinars in gold, and disappeared from them forthwith, and they\nmarveled at the appearance of him, and at his words.  And after these men had gone to\nsleep in their houses, he transported the church from Lower Egypt to the city of Beyahu in\nUpper Egypt; and when the men of the city rose up in the morning they found the church\nstanding there; and they marveled greatly, and glorified God.  And many miracles have\nbeen worked therein from that day to this.\nAnd on this day one thousand six hundred men suffered martyrdom under Herminius (or,\nArminius), the governor.  Salutation to the sixteen hundred martyrs of Herminius.  [In the\nBodleian MS. the number is 18,000.]\nAnd on this day also was re-opened the church of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the\nGod-bearer, in the market place of Wela, in the city of Mesr (Cairo), after it had been\nclosed for three years and six months.   This took place in the year one thousand and\ntwenty of the [Era of the] Righteous Martyrs (A.D. 1304).  Salutation to the opening of the\nchurch, O Virgin Mary.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and he was beloved by everyone because of\nhis strength and goodliness.  And because the people of Antioch lived him so greatly they\npainted a picture of him on the doors of the city, and they painted also pictures of his\nenemies fleeing vanquished before him.  And the saint read many of the Books of the\nChurch.  And the Emperor of Rome heard the report of him, and he wrote to his father, and\nasked for him, and his father sent him to him.   When he arrived there the Emperor of\nRome went out to meet him with his soldiers, and he and all the men of the city rejoiced in\nhim.  And in those days a great war broke out with the men of Kuez (Khuzistan) and the\nmen of Armenia, and Saint Clauidius marched against them, and conquered them, and he\nseized their king and broke them.  After this he returned to the city of Antioch, and he\nfound that the Emperor Diocletian had denied our Lord Jesus Christ, and was worshipping\nidols.   And Claudius had a friend whose name was Victor, and he was the son of\nHermanus, and they were reciting at all times words of the Holy Scripture, which were\nbeneficial for the salvation of their souls; and they agreed together to shed their blood for\nthe sake of the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And Satan appeared unto them in the form\nof an old man, who pretended to be suffering grief, saying, “O my sons, ye goodly young\nmen, the sons of emperors, I am afraid on your account, and I sorrow for you, I advise you\nto make friends with this infidel emperor, and to cast incense to his gods and idols; when\nhe commandeth you to do this, do not transgress his command, but serve ye Christ in your\nhouses, for this emperor is strong, and mighty, and merciless.”  And our Lord Jesus Christ\nmade them to understand that he who was speaking to them was Satan, and the saints, said\nunto him, “O thou who art filled with all manner of evil, and who art the father of lies, get\nthee gone from us, for thou dost always oppose the path of God.”  And straightway the old\nman changed his appearance, and became like a black man, and he said unto them,\n“Behold, I will [go] before you to the emperor and make him to shed your blood.”  And\nSatan went to Diocletian, and said unto him, “If thou dost not kill Victor and Claudius they\nwill rise up against thee, and kill thee, and take thy kingdom.”  Therefore did the emperor\nsend to Saint Claudius, and call him, and he came to him; and the emperor asked him to\ncast incense to his idols, and promised to give him his father’s office, but Claudius neither\naccepted his promise, nor submitted to his order.  Now the emperor did not dare to speak\nto (i.e. threaten) Claudius in the city of Antioch, for Saint Claudius spake to him boldly\nand fearlessly and reviled him.  And Romanus advised Diocletian to send Saint Claudius\nto the country of Egypt, and to kill him there, [saying,] “He is a heretic like my son\nVictor.”  And the emperor wrote a letter to the governor of Antinoe, saying, “Claudius will\naccept [nothing] from us, and he will neither hearken to our words nor obey them.  Do\nthou persuade him with all thy power to return to his allegiance to us, and if he will not do\nso cut off his head with the sword.”  When Saint Claudius heard that the emperor had\nordered them to send him to Egypt, he commanded Sidrakos, his sister’s husband,\n[concerning her,] and committed her to his care, and he embraced him, and departed to the\ncountry of Egypt, together with the emperor’s envoys.  When he arrived in the presence of\nArianus, the governor of Antinoe, and the governor saw him, he rose up and kissed his\nhand, and he entreated him, saying, “O my lord Claudius, do not this thing, and do not\ntransgress the emperor’s command.”  And they held converse together in this wise until\nArianus became furious and filled with wrath, and he drove the spear which he had in his\n\nhand into the saint, who delivered up his spirit straightway, and received the crown of\nmartyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  And certain believers came and took the body\nof Saint Claudius, and swathed it with costly cloths, and laid it with the body of Saint\nVictor; and the bodies remained thus until the end of the days of persecution.  And the\nmother of Saint Victor came to the city of Antinoe, and she made the bodies ready for\nburial. And she carried them to the city of Antioch.  They say, however, that the body of\nSaint Claudius resteth now in the city of Asyut.  Salutation to Claudius.  Salutation to the\none and twenty and to the six and sixty members of the palace of Claudius who suffered\nmartyrdom through him.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated the consecration of the church of the Forty soldier-\nmartyrs in the church of our Redeemer Jesus Christ, in the city of Alexandria, and\nKirubaweyanu, the archbishop.  Salutation to the consecration of Thy Church, O Jesus the\nRedeemer.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

And let the altar be\n[re-dedicated] to God Most High, and let the poor, and the needy, and the wretched, eat the\noxen and sheep which the priests slay, and the glorious angel Michael shall intercede on\nyour behalf with our Lord Jesus Christ.”  And this good counsel pleased them, and they\nyielded to his wishes, and they made the temple a church in the name of the glorious angel\nMichael the Archangel.  And that temple became known as the “Church of Caesarea,” and\nit continued to stand until the Muslims reigned in Egypt, and then they destroyed it.  And\nthis festival was established by order, and all the people of the districts [in Egypt]\ncelebrated it in honor of the glorious angel Michael the Archangel to his grade, above all\nthe angels, and to his greatness, and the archangel performed many miracles among which\nis the following:  There was a certain man who feared God, and who used to celebrate the\ncommemoration of the glorious angel Michael on the twelfth day of each month, and\nespecially during the months of Hedar and Sane.  And there was among his neighbors a\nrich man who was without mercy, and he used to hate that God-fearing man when he\ncelebrated the festival of the glorious angel, and to laugh at him.  When the days of the\nGod-fearing man had come to an end, and the time of his death, when he would rest from\nthe labor of this fleeting world, drew nigh, he commanded his wife to be merciful, and to\ncelebrate the commemoration of that glorious angel Michael, and especially the festivals\nwhich fell on the twelfth day of Hedar and on the twelfth day of Sane.  Now at the time of\nthe death of the God-fearing man, his wife was with child.  And after the man died his wife\nburied him.  And at that time the woman was near her time to bring forth, and the pains of\nchildbirth seized her, and she was in very great tribulation, and she said, “O Michael, angel\nof God, have compassion upon me, and entreat God on my behalf so that He may deliver\nme from the tribulation in which I am, and which hath come upon me this day; for with\nthee there is great grace with God.”   And when she had said these words, the house\nwherein she was became full of light, and forthwith she was relieved of her pains, and she\nbrought forth a child whose appearance was godly.  And the angel of God, the glorious\nMichael, came down from heaven, and he blessed the child, and said, “Thus saith God: \nThis child shall inherit the goods of the rich man who hath no mercy, and all his\npossessions and all his lands.”  At that moment the rich man was looking out from the\nwindow of his house upon the house of the woman, and he heard the voice of Michael, the\nangel of God, saying, “This child shall inherit the money of the rich man.”  Then great\n\nsorrow came upon him, and he sought for a pretext for killing the child, but God protected\nhim through the intercession of the glorious angel Michael.  And when the days of the\nchild were ten years, his mother’s money came to an end, and the rich man, with small\nmercy in him, found his opportunity against the woman.  And he said unto her, “Give me\nthy son, and let him minister unto me, and I will feed him and clothe him, and will give\nthee twenty dinars in gold.”  When the woman heard these words from the rich man she\nrejoiced on account of her poverty, and the rich man gave her twenty dinars in gold, and\nshe gave him her son; and having taken him the rich man rejoiced with a great joy, and he\nsaid in his heart, “Behold what I have desired is fulfilled for me.”  Then he made a wooden\nbox as long as the boy was tall, and he forced the boy into the box, and fastened the cover\nover him, and he carried the box to the river, and cast it into the water, and he also cast the\nkey of the box into the river.  And by the Will of God the box floated on the surface of the\nriver until it came to the quay of a certain city, which was not far from the river.  And there\nwas a certain shepherd who was watching and tending his flocks near the river, and when\nhe saw the box in the river, he dragged it out, and carried it into his house, and he was\nthinking by what means he would open the box.  And as he was thinking about this matter,\nGod put the thought into his heart that he should go to the river, and straightway he went\nand found a man catching fish.  And the shepherd said unto him, “Cast [thy] net into the\nriver in my name, and I will give thee the price of the fish which shall be caught”; and the\nfisherman did as the shepherd told him.  And a great fish came out from the net, and the\nshepherd gave him the price thereof; and taking it he went to his house, and he killed the\nfish to broil it, that he and his household might eat.   And having slit open the belly of the\nfish he found a key inside it, and he said within himself, “Perhaps this is the key of the\nbox.”  And having inserted the key into the keyhole of the box, the box opened quickly,\nand the shepherd marveled for he found inside it the boy whom the rich man wanted to\nkill.   When he saw [the boy] he rejoiced in him with a great joy, and he called him\n“Bahran” because he found him in the river; and the boy became to him as his son.  Now\nthe distance of the city wherein the boy was born, from that wherein the shepherd lived,\nwas a journey of ten days.  And after many days the rich man in whom there was no mercy\nwished to go and sojourn with the shepherd, and when the sun was about to set he said\nunto the shepherd, “Peradventure thou hast a place wherein we can lodge until to-morrow;\nif thou hast I will pay thee thy charge.”  And the shepherd brought the rich man into his\nhouse, and he called the young man by his name of “Bahran.”  When the rich man heard\nthis name he asked the shepherd, saying, “Is this thy son?”  And the shepherd said unto\nhim, “Yea, I found this young man when he was a little boy in a box in the river, and I took\nhim and reared him as my son.”  When the rich man, in whom there was no mercy, heard\nthis he was very sorry in his heart, and he knew that the young man was the boy whom he\nhad thrown into the river to kill him.  And on the morrow the rich man wished to depart,\nand he devised a device of Satan and said unto the shepherd, “I want thee to give me this\nthy son so that I may send him with a message to my house in the city which is called So-\nand-so, because I have forgotten something which is in my house; and the payment of\ntwenty dinars of gold which I should give to him I will give to thee.”  And the shepherd\nrejoiced because of the gold, and he called the young man and said unto him, “O my son\nBahran, come that this honorable man may send thee to his house on some business\nconcerning his house, and return to my house in peace”; and the young man said unto him,\n“Willingly, O my father, whatsoever thou commandest me I will do.”  Then straightway\nthe rich man wrote a letter to his steward, saying, “When thou hast read this letter kill the\nbearer of it, whose name is ‘Bahran,’ and cast his body into a pit.  Let no one know about\nthis until I come in peace”; and he wrote on the letter a certain sign which they had agreed\nupon, and which none but they two knew.  And he sealed the letter and gave it to Bahran,\nand he gave him what money was needful for the journey, and the young man departed. \nAnd as he was journeying along the road, he was about half-way between the two cities,\nbehold one day the angel of God, Michael, the Archangel, came to him, riding upon a\nhorse in the form of a soldier of the emperor; and he said unto Bahran, “What hast thou\nwith thee?”   And he said unto him, “I have with me a letter from a rich man who hath sent\nme to his house in such and such a city.”   And the angel of God, the glorious Michael,\nsaid unto him, “Show me the letter,” and Bahran being afraid of him gave him the letter. \nAnd the angel blew on the paper, and obliterated everything, which was written upon it.\n\nAnd the glorious angel, Michael, the Archangel, wrote with his own hand on the paper,\nsaying, “Behold, I the rich man So-and-so have sent unto thee the bearer of this letter\nwhose name is Bahran.  As soon as ye have read this letter marry my daughter So-and-so\nto him, I have given him all the goods in my house, and all my lands.  Do not wait until I\ncome back, for I shall tarry on my journey.  Let him do what he wisheth in my house, for I\nhave given him authority over all my goods and over my house.  Here is the sign which is\nbetween thee and me, O my steward, So-and-so.”  And the angel of God, the holy angel\nMichael, the Archangel, sealed the letter, and gave it to Bahran, and said unto him, “Go to\nthe house of the rich man, and when thou hast arrived at his house give this letter to his\nsteward, and do not tell him that I met thee on the road, and that I have changed [the\ncontents of] this letter.”  And Bahran said unto him, “Yea, my lord, everything which thou\nhast commanded me I will do.”  And Bahran went on until he arrived at that city, and he\nenquired for the house of the rich man So-and-so, and one brought him to it, and he gave\nhis letter to his steward.  And when the steward had read it, and understood the contents\nthereof, he recognized the [private] mark, and knew that it was authentic.  And forthwith\nthey made a great marriage-feast for Bahran and the daughter of the rich man, and they\nmarried them in the church, before the sanctuary of God; and they lived in the happiness\nof marriage for forty days.   And towards the end of the marriage-feast the rich man\nreturned to his city, and when he heard the sound of the music and singing, and the\nrejoicings, he asked, saying, “What is this sound which I hear?”  And certain of the men\nsaid unto him, “Thy letter came by the hand of a young man called Bahran, and as in it\nthou didst command that thy daughter should be married to him, they gave her to that\nyoung man whose name is Bahran.  And behold they have been rejoicing in the marriage-\nfeast forty days and forty nights.  And they have given him all thy money, and thy house,\nand menservants and handmaidens, and all thy possessions, according to what thou didst\ncommand in thy letter.”  And when the rich man heard these words, he cried out at the top\nof his voice, and fell down and died; and straightway the Satans took his soul into the\nlowest Hades.  And the young man inherited all his money even as God the Most High had\ncommanded.  And the young man Bahran celebrated the commemoration of the glorious\nangel of God, Michael the Archangel, on the twelfth day of each month, and he knew that\nit was he who had appeared unto him and breathed on the letter and obliterated what was\nwritten therein, and had written other matter in its place.  And after this he built a beautiful\nchurch in the name of the glorious angel Michael, the Archangel, and he painted a picture\nof him in it in front of the sanctuary, and through this picture many signs and wonders\nwere made manifest, and the sick were healed.  And Bahran was appointed priest of that\nchurch, and he ministered therein until the day of his death, and his mother and his son\ninherited everlasting life through the intercession of the glorious and holy angel, Saint\nMichael, the Archangel.   And on the day of the resurrection this glorious angel bowed\nbefore the throne of God, and said, “I beg and entreat Thy compassion, O my God, I Thy\nservant and messenger, to make known to me all those who celebrate my commemoration\nupon earth, through Thy righteous promise, for Thou art merciful and compassionate.” \nAnd God answered and said unto him, “O Michael, chief of the faithful hosts of heaven,\nbehold, I command thee to lift up upon thy wing of fire as many [men] as thou art able to\ncarry upon it, three times.”  And when Saint Michael heard this he rejoiced and was glad,\nand he lifted up upon his wing three times [as many as he could of] the men who\ncelebrated his commemoration upon earth and made them to pass by the river of fire.  And\nthere were thousands of thousands and tens of thousands of tens of thousands, and no one\ncould number them except God Himself.  Therefore, O beloved, it is meet that we should\nstrive, and should celebrate the commemoration of the glorious angel Michael, the\nArchangel, as well as we are able, even if it be only to give a cup of cold water in his\nname, even as our Lord saith in His Holy Gospel.  And let us ask for mercy from God\nthrough the intercession of the glorious angel Michael, that He may deliver us from the net\nof Satan, the accursed, and may put far away from us all pain (or, sickness) and the plague,\nand may increase the fruits of our lands in performing His mercy, and may forgive us our\nsins, and may give rest to the souls of our dead, and may bring back in safety those of our\nfathers and brethren who are on a journey, and may set peace in our midst, and may\nstrengthen us in the True Faith to our last breath.  And this glorious angel Saint Michael\nthe Archangel performed many miracles.  Salutation to Michael.\n\nAnd  on this day also is commemorated the death and history of Saint Euphemia.  This\nholy woman was the wife of a man who feared God, and he gave much alms, and kept\nthree festivals each month, that is to say, the festival of the glorious Saint Michael, on the\ntwelfth day of each month, and the festival of our holy Lady the Virgin Mary on the\ntwenty-first day of each month, and the festival commemorating the birth of our Lord and\nRedeemer Jesus Christ on the twenty-ninth day of each month.  And when the day of his\ndeath drew nigh, he commanded the saint, his wife, never to fail in giving alms as he was\nwont to do, and especially to keep these three festivals.  And she asked her husband to\nhave painted a picture of the glorious angel Saint Michael, the Archangel, in her house,\nand to give it to her, and he did this for her; and when he died this saint continued to do as\nher husband had done.  And Satan was jealous of her, and he came unto her disguised as a\nwidow who was a nun, and he came to her and held converse with her, saying, “I am sorry\nfor thee and pity thee.  And now I advise you to marry, and to bring forth a son before thy\nmoney come to an end, and thou fallest into want at the last.”  And then he said unto her,\n“Behold, thy husband hath inherited the kingdom of heaven, and he hath no need of\nalms.”   And she answered and said unto him, “I have promised God that I will never\nconsort with another man; even the doves and the ravens do not take second mates.  How\nthen can men who are created in the form and likeness of God do this?”  And when she\nwould not hearken unto his advice, he changed his form, and cried out against her, saying,\n“I will come to thee another day”; and she took the picture of the glorious Saint Michael,\nand drove him away therewith.  And when the twelfth day of Sane had come, and she was\noccupied with the celebration of the festival according to her custom, Satan appeared unto\nher in the form of the glorious Saint Michael, and he said unto her, “Peace be unto thee !  I\nam Michael, the Archangel, God hath sent me to thee, and He commandeth thee to cease\nfrom these alms, and to marry a believing man.  Know thou that a woman without a man is\nlike a ship without a rudder”; and he began to bring to her proofs out of the Old Testament,\nand to show her how Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and David, and others like unto them\nmarried wives and pleased God.  And the saint answered and said unto him, “If thou art an\nangel of God, where is the symbol of the Cross on thee?  The soldier of a king never goeth\nto another place without the symbol of the king on him.”  When Satan heard these words\nfrom her, he changed his form, and he began to choke her, and she prayed to the glorious\nSaint Michael, and he came unto her forthwith and delivered her from him.  And he seized\nSatan and began to punish him, and Satan entreated him, saying, “God will bear with us\nuntil the end of the world.  Have mercy upon me and do not torture me”; and he gave her\nthe salutation of peace and went up into heaven.   And after she had finished the\npreparations for the feast in the proper manner, she sent to the bishop and the priests, and\nthey came to her, and she gave them all her money to give to the poor, and the needy, and\nthe destitute.  And she took the picture of the glorious Saint Michael, and prayed to it, and\nlaid it upon her face and breast, and then she died in peace.  Salutation to Euphemia who\nconquered Mastema (i.e. Satan).\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Justus, the sixth Archbishop of the city of\nAlexandria.  This saint was a learned and honorable man of Alexandria, and Saint Mark,\nthe evangelist, baptized him, and his mother, and many others, with Christian baptism. \nThen Anianus, the perfect deacon, made him a reader, and on another occasion he made\nhim a priest.  And he grew up in the Law of the Church, and he knew all the Scriptures,\nand he frequently sat with Saint Anianus; and he taught the people, and confirmed them in\nthe True Faith.  And when Abba Barmeyu died, they took him, and against his will made\nhim Archbishop of the city of Alexandria.  And he protected well the Church in all the land\nof Egypt, and he ruled them rightly and as was fitting.  He sat upon the throne of Mark the\nevangelist for twelve years, and he died in peace, at a good old age, and pleased his God. \nSalutation to Justus whom Mark baptized.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Cyril, the sixty-seventh Archbishop of the\ncity of Alexandria.  When the father Abba Gebre Christos, the archbishop who preceded\nhim, died, the bishops and elders of the people agreed together, and went up to the\nmonastery of Saint Abba Macarius, of the desert of Scete, and they passed two months\nthere in seeking to find out who was the most suitable man for this holy position.  And\nthere was in the monastery of Saint Abba John Kama a certain righteous man, whose name\n\nwas Gebre Christos, who had the power of seeing the future by the Holy Ghost.  And the\nangel of God appeared unto him, and said unto him, “Speak to the bishops and say unto\nthem, ‘Trouble not, for behold there is among you in the monastery of Saint Abba\nMacarius, a man who is fit for this honorable position; and his name is Ga’argi.’”  And\nstraightway Saint Gebre Christos told them these words, and they took this father against\nhis will, and made him Archbishop of the city of Alexandria.   And the Church shone\nthrough him, and all the people of the Church in the country of Egypt rejoiced in that\nappointment.  And he was exceedingly learned, and he appointed bishops, and priests, and\ndeacons, and he restored many churches.   During his period of office he appointed a\nsecond bishop to the country of Ethiopia, whose name was Sawiros.  He was the brother of\nthe Bishop of Ethiopia, and had been brought up in his house there [in Egypt].  And when\nAbba Sawiros arrived in the country of Ethiopia the people rejoiced greatly in him because\nof his knowledge and his righteousness; and he converted very many from their evil deeds\nto repentance and the fear of God.  And the king of Ethiopia had many wives, and his\nnobles also, and through the teaching of the bishop they all gave up their companies of\nwives and each man lived with one wife only.  And when he had been in office for eleven\nyears and three and a half months, after partaking of the Holy Mysteries, he died in peace. \nAnd they carried his body to the monastery of Abba Macarius, and laid it with the bodies\nof the archbishops.  Salutation to Cyril the archbishop.\nAnd on this day also died the blessed and pure seer of the mysteries of heaven Lalibela\n[surnamed Gebre Meskel], King of Ethiopia.  The parents of this saint having begotten\nhim, they brought him up in the fear of God.  And when he had grown up, an had arrived\nat man’s estate, the king his elder brother heard that he would inherit the kingdom, and sit\nupon his throne, and jealousy came upon him.  And he sent and called him, and when he\ncame, and stood up before him, he contrived a matter against him, and he commanded his\nservants to beat him, and they beat him with very many stripes, from the third hour of the\nday to the ninth hour; and after this he commanded them to set him before him.  And when\nhe stood up before him the king and all his soldiers marveled when they saw that no injury\nhad happened to him; now the angel of God had supported him.  Then the king said unto\nhim, “Forgive me, O my brother, for what I have done to thee”; and then they made peace\nand were reconciled to each other.  And God saw the punishment, which he suffered that\nday, and He made him to inherit the kingdom.  And having become king he meditated on\nthe things, which would please God, and he made many gifts to the poor and needy.  And\nwhen God saw the strength of his live, the angel of God appeared unto him in a dream, and\nhe showed him how he was to build ten churches together, but each being different from\nthe other.  And he did as God showed him, and when he had finished the building of these\nchurches, he made his brother’s son to inherit the kingdom.  Salutation to Lalibela, the\nbuilder of churches.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

And when Abba Epiphanius came to the\ncity of Jerusalem, this father Abba John invited him to his house, and he placed before him\na table whereon were set the beautiful vessels of silver with pottage in them.  And then\nAbba Epiphanius saw that Abba John had in him no mercy for the poor and needy; and he\nwas very sorry for him, and his heart was in pain because of him.  And after he had gone\nforth from him Abba Epiphanius devised the following plan:  He was dwelling in one of\nthe monasteries of Jerusalem, and he sent to Saint Abba John, saying, “Know, O my\nbrother, that the elders of the city of Cyprus, and all the chiefs of the people, have come to\nvisit me, and I wish thee to do me honor before them, and to send to me from your house\nthe silver vessels of thy table that they may eat pottage from them”; and Abba John sent\nthe vessels to him.  And Saint Abba Epiphanius took them, and sold them, and received the\nprice of them, and he gave away the money in alms to the poor and needy.  And after a few\ndays Saint Abba John said unto the holy and blessed Abba Epiphanius, “Give me back the\nvessels of my table which I sent unto thee”; and Epiphanius said, “Yea, I will.”  And Abba\nJohn demanded them from him a second, and a third time, and Epiphanius said unto him,\n“Yea, I will.”  And when he did not give them up, Abba John seized him by the hem of his\ngarment in the church, on [the day of] the Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, and he\nsaid unto him, “I will not let thee go until thou givest me back my [silver] vessels.”  And\nAbba Epiphanius prayed, and entreated God, and God made Abba John blind.  Then Abba\nJohn wept and entreated Epiphanius, who prayed to the Lord God our Lord Jesus Christ,\nand He opened for him one of his eyes.  And Epiphanius said unto him, “Behold, our Lord\nJesus Christ hath left blind one of thine eyes so that thou mayest remember thy good\nspiritual fight, and thy strivings, and thy former good and willing deeds.  Know thou that I\nhave sold the vessels of thy table, and have given the price thereof in alms to the poor and\nneedy on thine account.  I only came to Jerusalem because I heard that thou wast a lover of\nmoney.”  And from that time Abba John awoke from his dream of inertness, even as a man\nwaketh up out of slumber, and he walked diligently in the path of charity, and more than\nany man he gave away in alms all his money, and all the clothes which he had.  And he\ngave up the acquisition of money and the riches of this fleeting world, and at last, at the\ntime of his death, there was not found with him one dirham of gold, or any smaller piece\nof money.  And God gave him the great gift of healing, and he worked many miracles, and\nhe used to heal all those who were sick or who had diseases by anointing them with holy\noil from the Tomb of our Lord Jesus Christ, and he protected them by means of the sign of\nthe Life-giving Cross.  And having finished his spiritual fight and his divine excellences,\nand pleased God, he died in peace.  Salutation to John the Perfect, Bishop of Jerusalem.\n\nAnd on this day also the Christian peoples of the land of Egypt are accustomed to\ncelebrate the festival of the glorious angel, the Archangel Gabriel, the captain of the host\nof heaven, who preached the new tidings.  In the first place it was he who brought news to\nDaniel, when he was praying and entreating God for the return of the children of Israel\nfrom captivity, and for their deliverance from Satan.  And this great angel appeared unto\nhim, and announced to him the deliverance of the children of Israel from the captivity of\nBabylon, and the building of the sanctuary in Jerusalem; and he announced to them the\ncoming of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And he defined the number of years after the passing of\nwhich our Lord Jesus Christ would come, and he made him to know that He would be\nkilled, and that afterwards the city of Jerusalem would be laid waste, and that no other\nMessiah would come after Him except the False Messiah.  And when the years which he\nhad defined were ended, and the time had come for the Redeemer to arrive, this glorious\narchangel, and captain of the hosts of heaven, Saint Gabriel, came from God and\nannounced to our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, the coming to her of the Son\nof the Living God, and His Incarnation through her.  And Gabriel appeared in the flesh\nbecause God loved him, and it was for this reason that He sent this angel on these two\ngreat missions.  And our fathers, the doctors of the holy Church, have commanded us to\ncelebrate a festival in his honor each year.  Let us entreat him to intercede for us with out\nLord and Redeemer Jesus Christ, that He may deliver us from our enemies, for he is nigh\nunto Him, and he standeth before His throne, so that by his intercession we may find grace\nbefore our God, to Whom are meet praise, and [ascription of] might, and laud, and the\nheartiest thanksgiving, and honor, [on] all days.  Salutation to Gabriel.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated Cainan, who lived nine hundred and ten hundred\n(sic) years; and he died on the fourth day of the week.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated ‘Abulag, the martyr, and two hundred martyrs,\nand our father Matyan, who were persecuted for righteousness’ sake.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and Abba Latsun devoted himself to God and to the spiritual fight.  Then by\nthe advice of his teacher he went out and dwelt by himself, and he kept vigil, and prayed,\nand fasted continually.  And there was near him a certain monastery, the monks of which\nhe used to visit, and one day when he went to the monastery he found the abbot of the\nmonastery sick and nigh to die; and all the monks were round about him weeping.  And\nthen Saint Abba Latsun saw the hosts of Satan surrounding him, and he asked the abbot,\nsaying, “What hath happened to thee, O Father?”  And the abbot commanded the monks to\ngo forth from him, and he began and told Abba Latsun all the sins which he had committed\nduring his youth, and they were very great indeed, and very many.  And he said unto him,\n“Forgive me, O my brother, I have done many evil things, and there is no man before me\nwho hath done the like, as for example:  When I wanted to be made a priest, and they\nwould not make me one, I departed to another place, and I said that the bishop had made\nme a priest, and I consecrated the Offering without fear.  And I took the Holy Body and I\nworked magic therewith.  And I lay with the mother, who brought me forth ten times, and\nshe conceived by me, and when she was near her time for bringing forth I made her drink\nmedicine so that I might kill the child.  My sin is very great indeed.  And behold, the time\nof my death and of my departure from this world hath arrived, and I have no good deed,\nwhich I can offer unto God.  I beseech thee, O my father, and I bow to thee before God,\nthat thou mayest remember me in thy holy prayers.”  And Abba Latsun wept, and he saw\nthe Satans taking the soul of that man, and they tortured it with beatings with whips of fire;\nand it became black.  And after he had made the body of the abbot ready for burial, and\nhad buried him, Saint Latsun remembered the words of that wretched man, who said unto\nhim, “For God’s sake remember me in thy prayers.”  And he remembered the words of the\nHoly Gospel: “There is no greater love than this, that a man should give his life for his\nfriend” (John xv, 13).   And this saint continued to torture himself with every kind of\ntorture, and he besought our Lord Jesus Christ on behalf of the soul of that sinner and to\nhave mercy upon him.  And he tortured himself and died five times; and Saint Michael the\narchangel appeared unto him and said unto him, “Thou shalt not kill thyself.  It is not meet\nfor Him to have mercy on that sinner.  And his sin shall not be remitted unto him, for God\nis righteous and He doeth judgment and justice.  He doth not show grace unto him who is\nunworthy of grace, and He doth not punish the man who doth not deserve punishment.” \nAnd having killed himself once in beseeching God on behalf of the soul of that sinner,\nMichael the archangel came unto him, and said unto him, “Do not kill thyself, for God will\nnot have mercy upon that sinner.”  Then Abba Latsun drowned himself in the sea, (or,\nriver) and died.  And straightway there was a mighty peal of thunder, and our Lord Jesus\nChrist came down from heaven, and He sat on the shore and He commanded Saint\nMichael, and he brought the saint up out of the water, and raised him up alive from the\ndead.  And our Lord Jesus Christ said unto him, “Peace be unto thee, O My chosen one,\nLatsun, who dost thou kill thyself time after time for the sake of that sinner?  Mercy doth\nnot befit him.  His sins are very many, and they are most abominable; they are the very\nworst sins, and it is not right for a man to speak of them”; and Saint Abba Latsun did not\n\nanswer.  And he said unto Him, “I beseech Thee, O my Lord Jesus Christ, to show mercy\non that sinner in punishment; if Thou wilt not show mercy to him then take my soul with\nhim into punishment.”  And our Lord knew that the saint would kill himself many times\nfor the sake of that sinner.  And our Lord commanded and He touched his hands, and made\nhim like the dust; and He said, “This soul shall not suffer punishment from this time\nforward, but it shall never find mercy, and shall be like the dust”; and Saint Abba Latsun\nglorified our Lord Jesus Christ because of the great compassion and mercy which He\nshowed to that wretched man, and because He had brought him out of punishment.  And\nafter this our Lord said unto Abba Latsun, “Verily I say unto thee, O My chosen one\nLatsun, whosoever shall celebrate thy commemoration, or shall give incense, or an\noffering, or oil, or wax, or shall satisfy the hungry, or give drink to the thirsty, or clothe the\nnaked for thy name’s sake on the day of thy commemoration, or shall write the history of\nthy fight, I will write his name in the Book of Life in the heavens, and will blot out his\nsins.”  And when our Lord Jesus Christ had said these things unto him, He went up into\nheaven with great glory.  And Abba Latsun rejoiced with a great joy, and returned to his\ncave, and dwelt there fighting the fight for many days; and having finished his fight and\npleased God he died in peace.  Salutation to Abba Latsun.\nAnd on this day also is celebrated the commemoration of Abba Palamon, the great pilgrim\nand anchorite, who rejected the world, and dwelt in a monastery.  He devoted himself to\nGod, and he fought so many fights that Satan became weary of fighting against him.  This\nsaint dwelt for very many days in silence and solitude; he never laughed, and he never\nspoke to anyone, but he wept for his sins by day and by night.  Often Satan would come\n(?) to him to amuse himself with him, and to laugh at him, but he was not able to rejoice\n(?) over him wholly, for [the saint] was sad and clung to the Name of our Lord Jesus\nChrist; and because of this Satan was wroth with him.  One day Saint Palamon rose up and\ndeparted to Egypt, in order to sell the things, which he had made with his hands.  And as\nhe was going along the road, and was weeping so bitterly that his eyes were nearly washed\nout of his head by the abundance of his tears, Satan led him astray on the road, and would\nnot let him know where he was going; and at the end of six days the elder, being well nigh\n[dead] through hunger and thirst, fell upon the earth.  But God, the Lover of mankind, did\nnot allow His servant Palamon to be destroyed through Satan, and He drove away the\nunclean spirit, and set it afar off from him.  And when the elder knew everything, which\nhad happened to him, he cried out, saying, “O my Lord Jesus Christ, help me.”   And\nstraightway he heard a voice, which said unto him, “Fear not, for the Enemy shall not\nprevail over thee.  But rise up and go a little towards the north, and there thou shalt find a\nrighteous man, and elder monk, who dwelleth in the fastness of the mountain; his name is\nLatsun, and he hath undertaken many labors for My Name’s sake.  Tell him everything\nwhich hath happened unto thee from thy youth up, and how Satan hath tempted thee; he\nshall pray for thee that thy sin be forgiven thee.”  And straightway the holy and blessed\nPalamon rose up, and he took some of the things which his hands had made, and he\ndeparted to the mountain in the north, reciting as he went the psalm of David which saith,\n“O Lord deliver me for Thy Name’s sake”--to the end of the same (Psalm 79), and also the\neighth psalm, and at length God guided him to the place where the elder Saint Latsun was. \nWhen the elder Saint Latsun saw him, he rejoiced and he embraced him and took him up\nto the top of the rock.  After they had prayed, and sat down, Abba Palamon began to weep\nbitterly, and he told him all the sin, which he had committed from his youth up, and\nbegged earnestly for forgiveness; and he also told him, how Satan had tempted him.  And\nhe said unto him, “One day when I was journeying in Egypt to sell the work of my hands,\nSatan came to me, and made my mind to go astray, and he would not allow me to call\nupon the Name of my Lord Jesus Christ.  And he showed me a city, which had been built,\nlike the city of a king, and in it were waters, and gardens, and trees.  And as I was thinking\nhow I should sell the work of my hands, he appeared unto me in the form of a woman,\nwho was sorrowing for the death of her husband, who had left her much money.  And she\nsaid unto me, ‘I will buy from thee.’  And she brought me into the upper room of her\nhouse, and she lifted down the basket from my head, and she made me to sit down and\nwashed my feet.  And she commanded her handmaidens to bring a table and wine, and she\nbesought me frequently to eat with her; and we ate, and drank, and were drunken.  And as\n\nwe were talking together all the maidservants went out and we two were left together.  And\nstraightway mine eyes burned like fire with the lust of fornication, and I remembered not\nGod Who is in the heavens, nor His angels who serve therein, and I was like one who lay\nwith her often.  Afterwards, when I woke up, I looked about me and I could find nothing. \nThere was no woman, no house, no table, no people, no beasts, no waters, and no gardens;\nbut I found my head running round under the mountain of my abode, and I was as if I had\nneither eaten nor drunk.  Then I wept much, and I saw Satan standing far from me, and\nlaughing at me.  And he said unto me, ‘Woe be to thee Palamon, the pilgrim, who dost jest\nand laugh with me.  Behold I can snare thee like a bird!’  When I heard his words I made\nthe sign of the Cross over him, and he fled from me.  And now, O my father Latsun, I take\nrefuge in thy holiness; pray to God to forgive me my sins and my error.”   And Abba\nLatsun, answered and said unto Abba Palamon, “Fear not, I believe on God that He will\nforgive thee thy sin.”  The they rose up, and prayed three days and three nights, and there\ncame unto them a voice which said, “Fear not, O My faithful servants, henceforward the\nEnemy shall not prevail over you.  As for the sin which Palamon committed, I have placed\nit on the head of Satan, and not only the sin of Palamon have I placed there, but I will\nplace upon him the sins of all those whom he hath tempted.”  After this Abba Palamon was\nblessed by Abba Latsun and he departed to his abode praising God; and he died in peace. \nSalutation to Abba Palamon.\nAnd on this day also is celebrated the commemoration of the blessed Saint Abba Garima. \nThe father of this saint was Emperor of Rome, and his name was Masfeyanos; the name of\nhis mother was Sefengeya, and she was barren.  And having besought our holy Lady, the\nVirgin Mary, the God-bearer, she gave her this son; and she called his name “Isaac.” \nWhen he had grown up she taught him the Books of the Church, and then Isaac was\nappointed deacon.  And the men of Rome having made him emperor, he sat and judged\njustly and righteously for seven years.  And when Saint Abba Pantaleon of the cell heard\n[of him], he sent to him, saying, “O my son Isaac, let the dead bury their dead, and do thou\ncome and seek the kingdom of my Lord Jesus Christ”; and Abba Garima, having heard\nhim, forsook the kingdom, and went forth by night.   Then the angel Saint Gabriel\nappeared, and he carried him on his shining wing and at the third hour brought him into\nthe hand of Abba Pantaleon.  Now the length of the road was a journey of ten months and\nfour days.  The King of Ethiopia at that time was ‘Alameda.  When Abba Pantaleon saw\nSaint Isaac he embraced him, and kissed him, and then he arrayed him in the garb of the\nmonk; and the saint fasted and prayed so strenuously that his flesh congealed on his\nbones.  Then he went to a place [in] Madra and he lived there for three and twenty years,\nworking countless signs and wonders, and casting out devils, and healing the sick.  One\nday he sowed wheat at dawn, and reaped it in the evening, and some of it he offered as an\noffering; and on the following day he took the remainder up to the threshing floor, and he\ntrod out the sheaves of wheat, and obtained therefrom seventy-seven measures of grain. \nAnd he also planted a vine shoot on a rock, and it took root, and put forth leaves and bore\nfruit immediately.  And once when he was writing a letter, and the sun was about to set, he\nadjured the sun to stand still and it did so until he had finished his letter.  And the spittle,\nwhich he spat out, remaineth unto this day, and is a means for healing the sick; and once\nwhen a reed fell from his hand, it took root that very day.  One day certain calumniators\nwent to Abba Pantaleon and said,  “The priest Isaac consecrated the Offering after he had\neaten.”  And Abba Pantaleon having gone to him caught him on the road, and he said unto\nhim, “Wait, man, so that I may tell thee a secret.”  And Saint Isaac said unto him, “Let men\nshut me in, and remove the stones from us”; and they turned aside for a distance of five\nstadia.  And Abba Pantaleon said unto him, “O my son Isaac, thou hast terrified me,” and\nthereupon he was called Abba Garima.   And having finished his good course, our\nRedeemer appeared unto him, and promised him that [He would forgive the sins of] him\nthat should call upon his name, and celebrate his commemoration.  And straightway he\nwas caught up in a shining cloud and disappeared.  Salutation to Abba Garima.\nAnd on this day also is celebrated the commemoration of the saints of ‘Akuoren... and\nAbba Palaomn, and Bartholomew, and Alexandra, and Alexander, the martyrs, and Joseph,\nand ‘Arsema.\n\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

After this the Muslims took\nhim and laid him in a basket, and cast him into the river, and by the Will of God he came\nto the quay on the shore of an island, and his mother, who was waiting for him, took him\nand made him ready for burial, and laid him in her house for a few days.  After this they\nbuilt a church for him and laid him therein, and countless signs and wonders took place\nthere through him.  Salutation to George, and salutation to the woman his friend.\n\nAnd on this day also became a martyr Saint Besoy-nob, whose name meaneth “fine gold.” \nThis saint came from a city the name of which is Banos, in the district of Damietta, and he\nwas the son of noble and wealthy parents in that city.   He was one of the soldiers of\nCyprianus, the governor of Athribis, and he believed on the Name of the Lord Jesus\nChrist.  [And the governor of Athribis commanded his soldiers to bring him] into the city\nof Athribis, and they took him to the city of Antinoe; and he stood before Arianus,\ngovernor of the city of Antinoe, who was angry with him, and said unto him, “Cast incense\nto the gods.”  And he would not obey him, and was not afraid of him, and Arianus tortured\nhim severely.  Then he commanded them to cut off his head with the sword, and they took\nhim outside the city, and a crowd of men from the city followed him.  And in it was the\nkeeper of the lions of Arianus, the governor, and he had with him two lions bound with an\niron chain; and one of them rushed forward and broke the chain [and attacked the saint]. \nAnd the angel of God came to the saint and raised him up above the lions, and he flew\naway with him until he brought him to the Fountain of the Sun, and the saint, who had his\neyes closed, did not know where he was going.  And then they cut off his head with the\nsword, and he received the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  Salutation\nO Nub-Besoy, which is being interpreted, “fine gold.”\nAnd on this day also became martyrs the five soldiers ‘Arsonophis, Peter, ‘Ascarion,\n‘Arengis, and Belfeyos, who lived in the Palace of Diospolis.  When the governor urged\nthem to sacrifice to the gods, the saints said unto him, “We will fulfill the commandment\nof our Lord Jesus Christ, and to Him only will we sacrifice.”  When the governor heard\nthis he was wroth, and he commanded the soldiers to put them into a house, and not to\ngive them bread or water for two days.  Then he ordered them to bring them to him, and\nwhen they stood before him he said unto them, “Sacrifice ye to the gods.”  And the saints\nsaid unto him with one voice, “We are Christians, and we will not sacrifice to unclean\ndevils.”  And the governor commanded the soldiers to chain them by their necks, and to\ntake them to another governor.  And ‘Arengis said unto his brethren, “I tell you truth.  I\nheard the angel of God pronounce the names of the five of us.”  And when the soldiers had\nbrought them to Deses, the governor, he took the first of them ‘Arsonophis, and said unto\nhim, “Sacrifice to the gods”; and when he refused to do so the governor commanded them\nto fetter him, and to tie him to the tail of a horse, and drag him through the city.  When\nthey had brought him into the city, he commanded them to cast him into the furnace of the\npublic baths.  And they also tied him to a chariot to torture him, and hung him up head\ndownwards; and he kept his Faith and delivered up his soul. Next they brought Saint Peter,\nand Deses said unto him, “Sacrifice.”   And when he refused to do so the governor\ncommanded them to take him and fetter him, and to set up a post, and to hang him upon it,\nhead downwards, and to tie him to it in this position.  And they also dug a hole in the\nground, and covered him up in it with earth, and made a mule to tread it down, but the\nsaint bore this, God helping him.  When they brought him out his body was crushed (?) by\nthe excessive torture, and he was unable to speak; and then they tied him up in the hide of\nan animal [and left him] without bread and water.  And they brought ‘Arengis before the\ngovernor, who said unto him, “Sacrifice,” and when he refused to do so, Deses\ncommanded them to bind him with fetters, and to scraped him, and to hang him up head\ndownwards.  And having endured them, they tied him up in the hide of an animal [and left\nhim] without food and drink.  Then they brought ‘Ascarion to the governor, who said unto\nhim, “Sacrifice, and have pity on thyself.”  And when the saint refused to do so, Deses\ncommanded them to take him, and bind him in fetters, and scrape him, [and they did so,]\nand they delivered him over to the keepers of the instruments of torture to torture him\nseverely.  And they set up a tree, and hung him upon it head downwards.  And when he\nvanquished them by his endurance, they told the governor, and he commanded them to tie\nhim up in the hide of an animal, and to shut him up in a chamber to die of hunger and\nthirst.  And they brought to Deses Belfeyos, and the governor said unto him, “Sacrifice, so\nthat thou mayest not die.”  When he refused to do so Deses commanded them to take him,\nand bind him in fetters, and scrape him, and to drag him round the city.  And they set up a\ntree and hung him upon it, head downwards, and they tied a stone to his neck.  And when\nhe wavered not in his Faith, they tied him up in the hide of an animal to die of hunger and\nthirst; and they walled up the door of the house.  And [the soul of] the blessed ‘Arengis\n\nwas nigh to go forth from his body.  And ‘Arengis departed on the fifth day of the month\nof Pohin, and when they had brought him out they built up the door against the two that\nwere left.  And then the blessed ‘Ascarion died, holding the Faith, on the eighteenth day of\nthe month of Pohin; and when they had taken him out they built up the door against\nBelfeyos.  When the brethren visited the blessed man Belfeyos, he said unto them, “My\nbrethren, wait for me this night; I am going forth,” and then he delivered up his soul on the\nnineteenth day of the month of Pohin.   Salutation to ‘Arsonophis, and Peter, and\n‘Ascarion, and ‘Arengis, and Belfeyos.\nAnd on this day also is celebrated the commemoration of the holy fathers of Debre Kua’at.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

One day as he passed\nalong the road the young boys of Israel mocked him, and he cursed them, and the wolves\ncarried off nine and forty youths in one day.  And a certain woman of the wives of the\nprophets came unto him, and said unto him, “My husband died owing a debt, and behold\nthey have seized my children for it.”  And Elisha commanded her, saying, “Go and fill all\nthe jars which are in thy house with water, and borrow other vessels from thy neighbors,\nand fill them all with water”; and by his prayer he changed the water in all the vessels into\nsweet oil.   And the woman sold the oil, and extinguished the debt, which was on her\nhusband.  And Elisha blessed the barren woman and she bore a son.  And when that child\ngrew up he fell sick of a fever and died, and Elisha prayed over him and restored him to\nlife.  And when Naaman the Syrian came to him he cured him of his leprosy, and though\nNaaman brought to him much money, and raiment of gold, he would accept nothing from\nhim.  And when Geyaze (Gehazi), his servant, acted craftily and accepted some of those\npossessions, secretly and without Elisha’s permission, the prophet had knowledge about it\nthrough the Holy Spirit.  And he cursed his servant, and Geyaze (Gehazi) became a leper,\nand his sons and all his seed [were lepers].  And a great famine happened in those days,\nand by the prayer of this prophet in one night it changed into a great abundance; and\nbesides this, the prophet wrought many signs and wonders.  When he died and they were\nburying him in a grave, they brought at the same time another dead man and laid him\ndown on the grave of the prophet; and that dead man came to life straightway, and he rose\nup and followed the people, and departed to his house.  And the prophet Elisha prophesied\nin the reigns of four kings, who were Joram, and Ahaz, and Gotolya, the mother of Ahaz,\nand John, the son of Ahaz; and all the days of his prophesying were fifty years and more. \nHe prophesied before the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ six hundred years, and he died\nin peace.  Salutation to Elisha.\nAnd on this day is celebrated the commemoration of ‘Arsastal, the martyr, and Minas of\nBusar.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

This man was of the number of those who subscribed the statement that this\nfather was [not] worthy of the office of the archiepiscopate.  And they drove out this father\nto the city of Germanos, and he dwelt there for three months.  And Abba Severus was\nordained in the country of Egypt in those days, and he comforted this father, and reminded\nhim that tribulation came upon the apostles, and also on John, the Mouth of Gold (i.e.\nChrysostom).  Then this father went to the city of Malig, and dwelt there for two years. \nAnd the men of the city of Alexandria rose up against the governor, and demanded their\nshepherd, and he brought back this father Theodosius to his office, and expelled\nAcacianus.  And the story of him was heard by the Emperor Justinian from the God-loving\nEmpress Theodora; and she wrote a letter, saying, “He who was first appointed shall sit in\nhis office.”   And one hundred and twenty priests formed themselves into a General\nCouncil, and they subscribed a statement, saying, “Abba Theodosius was first appointed.” \nAnd straightway Acacianus rose up before the people, and said, “I have transgressed; evil\nmen force me.”   And then the people asked this father to remove the ban of\nexcommunication from Acacianus provided that he would promise never again to minister\nas priest or deacon; and Acacianus agreed to this, and Theodosius removed the ban of\nexcommunication from him.  Now the emperor was corrupt in his faith, and he imagined\nthat Archbishop Abba Theodosius agreed with him in his evil faith.  And he wrote a letter\nof his officers who were in the city of Alexandria, and said unto them, “If the Archbishop\nTheodosius is at one with us in our belief, let another office be added to his\narchiepiscopate, and let him be governor of the city of Alexandria; but if he be not at one\nwith us in belief, he shall go forth from his office.”  And when this father heard these\nwords he said, “Thus said Satan to our Lord Christ in the desert, I will give thee all the\nkingdom of the world and the glory thereof, if thou wilt worship me” (Matthew iv, 9). \nAnd Saint Abba Theodosius rose up and went forth from the city of Alexandria, and\ndeparted into Upper Egypt, and he dwelt there for a few days, strengthening the believing\npeople in the True Faith.  And the emperor heard that the saint had gone forth from the city\nof Alexandria, and he sent him a letter to persuade him, saying, “I want to meet you, I\nwant thee to bless me and to give me counsel.”   And Abba Theodosius went to\nConstantinople, and the archbishop, and all the people, and the soldiers went forth to\nwelcome him; and they set him upon a high throne, and disputed concerning the True\nFaith.   And the emperor continued to persuade the saint for many days, but the saint\nvanquished him with the words of the Holy Scriptures, and with the words of the Fathers. \nAnd when he would not agree with him, the emperor expelled him from his throne and\nsent him to Upper Egypt; and he appointed in his place another man whose name was\nPaul.  And when that Paul came to the city of Alexandria, the people would not receive\nhim, and he remained for a whole year, but only a very few people received the Offering\nfrom his hands.  When the emperor heard of this he commanded the soldiers to shut the\nchurches until the people submitted to Paul the archbishop, and the believers used to go\noutside the city to the church of Saint Mark the evangelist, and to the church of Cosmas\nand Damian, and partake of the Offering, and have their children baptized with Christian\nBaptism; and when the emperor heard this he had the churches opened.   When Abba\nTheodosius heard this he was afraid that the emperor would lead them astray, and he wrote\na letter to the people which was full of every kind of consolation, and he sent it to them,\nand strengthened them in the True Faith, saying, “Take good heed and submit not\nyourselves to that heretic Paul.”  And Theodosius remained in exile in Upper Egypt for\n\neight and twenty years, and he lived in the city of Alexandria four years; and all the days\nof his life (sic) were two and thirty years.  And this father composed many Homilies and\nTreatises of Doctrine, and the believers in the country of Egypt continued to be called\n“Theodosians” until the days of Abba Jacob, [when] they were called “Jacobites.”  And\nhaving finished his good course he died in peace.  Salutation to Theodosius.\nAnd on this day also Basil and Bifantius became martyrs.\nAnd on this day also took place the consecration of the house (church) of Abba Timothy in\nthe city of Damanhur.   Salutation to the consecration of thy house.   [Omitted in the\nBodleian MS.]\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  Salutation to\nAbraham, Isaac, and Israel-Jacob.  [Omitted in the Bodleian MS.]\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and the name of his mother was Bersabeh.  And after God had rebuked\nDavid for taking her from her husband, He slew his first child; and then David lay with\nher, and she conceived and bore him a son, and he called his name “Solomon.”  And when\nhe was twelve years old, and had grown up, and his father David the king had become old,\nBersabeh (Bathsheba) went into the royal chamber and prostrated herself before the king;\nand he said unto her, “What hath befallen thee?”  And she said unto him, “O my lord the\nking, thou didst swear to thine handmaid by thy God, saying, Thy son Solomon shall reign\nafter me, and shall sit upon my throne.”  And the king swore, saying, “As God liveth, Who\nhath redeemed my soul from all my tribulation, according as I swear unto thee before the\nLord God of Israel, saying, Thy son Solomon shall reign after me, [even so shall it be].” \nAnd Bersabeh (Bathsheba) bowed before the face of the king, and said, “My lord the king,\nlive for ever!”  And David said, “Call Zadok the priest to me, and Benaiah, the son of\nYodahe (Jehoiada), and Nathan the prophet”; and they came to the king.  And the king said\nunto them, “Take the servants of your lord with you, and set my son Solomon upon my\nmule, and take him down to Gihon, and anoint him there, and make him king over Israel (I\nKings 1:33).  And blow the trumpet and say, ‘[Long] live the royal father Solomon’; and\ncome up, and follow him.  He shall rise up on my throne because I have commanded that\nhe shall reign in my stead over Judah and Israel.”  And Zadok the priest, and Benaiah, the\nson of Yodahe (Jehoiada), and Nathan the prophet, and the Cherethite, and the Perethite,\nwent down, and they set Solomon on the mule of King David, and they took him into\nGihon.   And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the Tabernacle, and anointed\nSolomon, and he blew the horn, and all the people said, “[Long] live the royal father\nSolomon.”  And Solomon sat on the royal seat, and the servants of the king came and gave\nthanks to their lord David, the king and they said unto him, “May God make good [to rest]\non the   name of Solomon, and make his throne greater than thine!”   And the king\nprostrated himself on his bed, and spoke thus:  “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel Who\nhath given me this day seed to sit upon my throne whilst mine eyes can see!”  And David\ntold Solomon his son the path of righteousness, and he committed him to safe keeping,\nbecause of Joab and Shimei, the son of Gera; and David died.   And the Wisdom of\nSolomon was very much greater than that of the children of Israel who had been before\nhim, and that of the wise men of Egypt; and he judged all kingdoms, and the peoples\nbrought him gifts all the days of his life.   And his provision for one day was thirty\nmeasures of fine flour, and sixty measures of crushed grain, and ten fat oxen and twenty\nunstalled oxen, and one hundred sheep, and harts, and roebucks, and fallow deer and fatted\nfowl.  And he had forty thousand horses which drew chariots, and ten (twelve ?) thousand\nhorsemen.  And Solomon sacrificed in Gibeon ten hundred offerings.  And God appeared\nunto him in a dream and said unto him, “Ask thou a petition.”  And Solomon said unto\nHim, “Thou, O God, didst show mercy unto Thy servant David, my father, since he\nwalked righteously before Thee, and Thou hast made his son to sit on his throne.  Now, I\nam a little child, and I know not my coming in or my going out, and Thy servant is among\na great and innumerable people; and he hath no heart wherewith to hear and to administer\nrighteous judgment to Thy people.”  And God said unto him, “Because thou hast asked Me\nfor the power to understand judgment, and hast neither asked Me for many days [of life],\nnor for much riches, behold I have given thee a heart and wisdom the like of which no\nman before thee hath ever had, and none who shall rise up after thee shall ever have.  And\nwhat thou didst not ask of Me I give thee, riches and glory (honor) so great that there shall\nbe no man in the kingdom like unto thee.”  After this Solomon went to Jerusalem and he\nstood up before the Ark of the Law of God, and offered the sacrifices of peace.  That day\nthere stood up before him two women who were harlots, and one of them said, “Hear me,\nO lord, I and this woman live in the same house, and we have brought forth children.  On\n\nthe third day whilst we were sleeping, she lay upon her son and killed him, and she took\nmy child from my breast and said unto me, ‘He is my child’; and the other woman said, “It\nis my son who is alive.’”  And the king said, “Bring a butcher’s knife and cut the child in\ntwain, and give one half of him to this woman, and one half of him to that.”  And the\nwoman whose son was alive answered and said, “Give him to her alive, and do not kill\nhim”; and Solomon said, “Give the living child unto her who said, Do not kill him.” \nWhen Israel heard they were afraid before the face of the king, when they saw the wisdom\nof God, which was upon him.  And he spoke three thousand proverbs and [wrote] five\nhundred songs.  In the fourth year [of his reign] he founded the house of God, in the month\nof Sane, in the second month, [and it was finished] in the eleventh year; and it was sixty\ncubits long, and twenty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high.  When Solomon had finished\nthe building of the house of God, he gathered together the elders of Israel and made them\nto bring the Ark of God from the city of David into Zion, in the month of ‘Atamen\n(Ethanim).  and the priests carried the Ark, and the tabernacle of witness, and the king and\nall Israel slaughtered countless sheep and oxen before the Ark.  And the priests brought it\ninto its place within the shrine of the holy of holies, under the wings of the Cherubim,\nwhich were spread out; and the  wings of the Cherubim were over the place of the Ark. \nAnd Solomon stood up before the altar of God, before the companies of Israel, and he\nlifted up his hand to heaven, and prayed, and he made petitions to God in many prayers. \nAnd when he had finished his prayers God made the sun to appear in heaven, and the king\nblessed all the companies of Israel, and he slaughtered the peace offerings of God, four\nthousand oxen and one thousand sheep; and the king made provision for the house of\nGod.  And God appeared unto Solomon a second time, even as He appeared unto him in\nGibeon, and He said unto him, “I have heard thy prayer and the petition which thou hast\nmade to Me, and I will do for thee according to thy prayer and petition.”  And Solomon\nreigned forty years, and [he lived] twelve years before he reigned; and all the days of his\nlife were two and fifty years.  And he died in peace.  Salutation to Solomon.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Nob, the confessor.   This saint was a\ndevoted monk and fighter in one of the monasteries of Upper Egypt.  And when many\nmartyrs had shed their blood under the tortures of Diocletian, and [the people] had carried\naway their bodies, they remembered Saint Abba Nob, and brought him to Arianus,\ngovernor of Antinoe.  And the governor said unto him, “Cast incense to Apollo, and cast\naway this thy garb of the monk.”  And the saint answered and said unto him, “This shall\nnever be done by me, and I will never abandon my Lord Jesus Christ, and I will not\nworship idols of stone.”  And the governor tortured him with every kind of torture, and the\nsaint endured them by the might of our Lord Jesus Christ.  Then the governor banished\nhim to Five Cities, and [the governor] cast him into a pit; and he lived therein for seven\nyears, until God blotted out Diocletian and made Constantine, the righteous, emperor.  And\nConstantine sent out an Edict into all countries ordering his officers to release all those\nwho were in prison for the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ; and he commanded them to\nbring these prisoners to him, so that he might be blessed by them.  And he said unto his\nmessengers, “If ye cannot bring them all, bring to me their honored ones, and those who\nare learned, and the elders among them, so that they may bless me, and lay their hand upon\nmy head, and especially those who are well known, that is to say, Abba Zacharias from the\ncity of Ahnas, and Maximus from the city of the Fayyum, and Agabius from the city of\nDakhnin, and Abba Nob from the city of Balaos.”  And the emperor’s messenger went\nround about in all the countries, and the officers brought out all those who were shut up in\nprison, and they rejoiced and glorified God and sang to Him.  And the messenger of the\nemperor sought for Abba Nob, but the holy man having been expelled from Five Cities\n(Pentapolis), had gone to the city of Basla, opposite his city, where he lived and wore\napparel of iron.  And the messenger of the emperor found him, and took him with him, and\nhe made him embark in a boat, and at length he arrived at the city of Antinoe.  And the\nChristians gathered together, and there were four bishops among them, and they made\nAbba Nob a priest against his will; and he consecrated the Offering and administered to\nthe people the Holy Mysteries.  And when he had finished the Office he cried out and said,\n“Holiness to the holy ones!  Let him that is holy receive holiness!  God be with you all!” \nThen he saw our Lord Jesus Christ sitting upon the altar, and He forgave the sins of the\n\npeople who were penitent.  After this the saints followed the apostle to the emperor; now\nthey were in number two and sixty.  And they made ready for them two and sixty chariots,\nand each of them rode upon a chariot.  And as they passed along the road, virgins came\nforth from the nunneries, which were there, and welcomed them; and the virgins were in\nnumber seven hundred, and they sang to the saints until they were out of sight.  And when\nthe saints came to the Emperor Constantine, he commanded his servants to wash them\nwith water, and to array them in new apparel, before they entered his presence; and they\ndid as he commanded.  Now Saint Abba Nob did not wash himself with water, neither did\nhe change his apparel.  Then the saints entered the presence of the emperor, and he was\nblessed by them, and he kissed their wounds, and he paid them honor and gave them much\nmoney, but they would take nothing from him except sacred furniture and vestments for\nthe churches.  And after he had been blessed by them, and had embraced them, he set them\non their way and said farewell to them; and they returned to their country in peace.  And\nSaint Abba Nob went to his monastery and finished his fight nobly, and he departed to\nChrist, Whom he loved.  Salutation to Abba Nob.\nAnd on this day also is celebrated the commemoration of Markora, and Thomas, and\nPhilip.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

he\nwas the slave of a man who worshipped the sun, and he himself, on several occasions,\nlifted up his eyes to the sun and said, “O sun, if thou art God, make me to know it.”  And\nhe used to say in his heart, “O thou God Whom I know not, make me to know Thee.”  And\nhe heard some men saying that the monks of the desert of Scete knew God, and then he\nrose up, and girded on his sword, and went and came to the desert of Scete.  And he found\nSaint Abba Isidore the priest, and when he saw him, he was afraid of him.  And Abba\nMoses said, “I am Moses the Black, and I have come to you that ye may tell me about\nGod, and make me to know Him.”   And Isidore took him to Abba Macarius, who\nadmonished him, and taught him the Prayer of Faith (i.e. the Belief), and baptized him\nwith Christian baptism.  And he became a monk and lived in the desert, and he fought a\nfight which was greater than that fought by many saints; and Satan warred upon him\nbecause formerly he used to eat to excess, and commit fornication.  And he informed Abba\nIsidore about everything which came upon him in his fight with the Enemy; and Abba\nIsidore comforted him, and taught him what to do.  And in addition to his great fight he\nused, when the holy elders were asleep, to go round to their cells, and take their water-pots\nout of them, and go and fill them with water, and put them back in their cells; now the\nwater was a long way off.  And he continued his fight for many years.  And Satan was\nenvious of him, and he smote him severely with a severe disease in his foot, and he\nbecame very ill and lay down sick.  And when he knew that Satan had smitten him, he\nincreased his ascetic practices and spiritual fight, and his body became dried up like wood,\nwhich has been scorched with fire.  And God saw his endurance, and healed him of his\ndisease, and removed the sickness and the attacks of Satan; and the grace of the Holy\nSpirit descended upon him.  And five hundred brethren gathered together to him, and he\nbecame their abbot, and they chose him to make him a priest.  And when they set him in\nthe sanctuary, the archbishop wished to try him, and to get knowledge of his spiritual\nfight.  And the archbishop said unto the holy elders, “Why have ye brought this black man\nhere?  Take him away.”  And Moses went out reproaching himself, and he said, “They\nhave treated thee rightly, O black man, O thou whose face is horrible,” and after this the\narchbishop called him and laid his hand upon him, and made him a priest.   And the\narchbishop said unto him, “Behold, thou hast become white, all of thee, within and\nwithout.”  One day the holy elders came to him, and he had no water with him, and they\nsaw him go out and come in many times; and after this it rained a great rain which filled\nthe skins in their cells.  And the holy elders asked him, saying, “Why didst thou go out and\ncome in many times?”  And he said unto them, “I said unto God, If Thou dost not give me\nwater wherewith to give Thy servants to drink, where am I to obtain water to give them to\ndrink?”  And in His mercy He sent us water.  At that time Abba Moses went with the elders\nto Saint Abba Macarius, and Abba Macarius said unto them, “Behold, I see among you one\nto whom belongeth the crown of martyrdom.”  And Abba Moses answered and said unto\nhim, “Peradventure I am he, O my father.  For it is written, ‘He who hath slain with the\nknife shall die by the knife’” (Matthew xxvi, 52).  And when the Barbarians came, Abba\nMoses said unto the brethren who were there with him, “Behold the Barbarians have\ncome; let him among you who wisheth to flee, let him flee”; and they answered and said\nunto him, “And wilt not thou, O our father, flee?”  And he said unto them, “Behold, I have\nfor many years been waiting for this day, because of the word of our Lord Who said, He\nwho hath killed with the knife shall die by the knife”; and the Barbarians came and killed\nhim.  And with him were seven brethren who did not wish to flee, but one of them hid\n\nhimself behind a bed, and he saw the angel of God, with a crown in his hand, standing\nwaiting for him; and he went out to the Barbarians, and they killed him.  Observe, O our\nbrethren, the power of repentance and what it doth.  It changed a man who was an infidel,\nand a murderer, and a fornicator, and a thief, and made him a father, and a teacher, and a\ncomforter, and a priest, and one who laid down the Rule and Canon of the monks, and one\nwho is mentioned at the altar in all the churches.  And his body abideth to this day in\nDebre Badremos in the desert of Scete, and many signs and miracles are made manifest\nthrough it.  Salutation to Moses the Black.  Salutation to the six brethren who died with\nhim, and were slain by the Barbarians.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

he was the son of\nJoseph the carpenter and was one of the Seventy-two disciples.  This saint preached in\nmany cities, and he came into the island and preached therein, and built a church there. \nAnd he went to the city of Edessa and healed Abgar, the King of Edessa, of his illness, and\nhe baptized him with Christian baptism.  After this he went to ‘Araz and preached therein,\nand baptized many of the people thereof with Christian baptism.  And the governor of that\ncity seized him and tortured him with many tortures; he nailed iron cases on his feet, like\nsandals, and made him run in them for the distance of a stade, and he hung him up, and\nshot arrows at him, and the saint delivered up his soul.  Before they tortured him he sent an\nEpistle to the believers, and that Epistle is the seventh in the Book of the Apostles.  It is\nfull of wisdom and grace, and by its means he converted many of the pagans and brought\nthem into the Faith of our Lord Christ during his lifetime and before his death.  Salutation\nto Judah (Jude), whose feet had red-hot iron cases nailed on them.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father and fighter Abba Peter, the thirty-fourth\nArchbishop of the city of Alexandria.  This father was made archbishop when the Emperor\n‘Asbasyanos (Vespasian) drove out Archbishop Theodos who would not agree with his\nopinion, and he sat on the throne of Mark the evangelist without bishops for many years. \nAnd the emperor would neither permit the bishops, nor his nobles who were in the city of\nAlexandria, to appoint an archbishop.  And after a few days there was appointed over the\ncity of Alexandria a good, and excellent, and Orthodox governor, and the elders and the\nbelievers gathered together to him, and informed him of their grief because they had no\narchbishop.   And he commanded them to go out to Debre Zegag, that is to say Debre\nMahew, under the pretence of [going to] pray, and to appoint for themselves an\narchbishop.  Then they rejoiced at this counsel and they took Abba Peter, who was a priest,\nand they went out forthwith to Zegag, and they appointed him archbishop, and rejoiced in\nhim.   Before this Saint Severus, the holy man, died, and the city of Antioch remained\nwithout an archbishop.  When the believers of the city of Antioch heard that Abba Peter\nhad been appointed archbishop, they also appointed to be their archbishop a certain\nbeliever whose name was Theophanius, and he and father Abba Peter were of one accord\nin the matter of the True Faith.  And they wrote letters to each other on theological matters,\nand each preached the doctrine of his friend, and mentioned him at the time of prayer and\nat the Offering, but they were unable to enter each other’s city, for Abba Peter lived in\nDebre ‘Anabanya, which was to the south of Debre Zegag, and Abba Theophanius lived in\nDebre ‘Aftonyas, which was outside the city of Antioch.  In those days there were in the\ncity of Alexandria six hundred monasteries, and two and thirty villages, and all their\ninhabitants belonged to the True Faith (except the [so-called] Christians of the city of\nAlexandria), and all the districts of Mesr (Cairo) and Upper Egypt, and all the monks of\nthe monasteries of the desert of Scete, and Ethiopia, and Noba.  All these were of the True\nFaith, and they accepted the appointment of father Abba Peter as archbishop, and they\nwalked in his commands; and he never ceased to write to them Epistles, and he sent them\nto all believers and strengthened them in the True Faith.  And he used to go round to all the\nmonasteries of the city of Alexandria and the villages thereof, and teach the people, and\nadmonish them, and strengthen them.   And he had a certain holy and learned disciple\nwhose name was Damianus, and who became archbishop after him, and he used to help\nhim in all the work and in directing the people.  And this father Abba Peter once came into\nthe city of Alexandria, and saw the works of its people, and inspected them and\nstrengthened them.   And thus he remained in his office, and traveled about like the\nApostles, and shepherded his flock for a period of two (?) years; and he was strong in the\nTrue Faith and died in peace.  Salutation to Peter who was made archbishop at Zegag.\n\nOn this day also died Pilate, the confessor.  Salutation to Pilate who washed his hands of\nthe Blood of Jesus Christ.  [Waiting in the Bodleian MS.]\nAnd the doctors of the Church had decreed that on this day Christians shall celebrate the\nfestival of Peter and Paul, that they may bless the entrance of the winter season.  Salutation\nto Peter and to Paul, [and to] the sequence of the winter.  [Wanting in the Bodleian MS.]\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and then they showed them their dried\nand moldy food, and their old garments, and Joshua believed them and swore to them that\nhe would not kill them.  And when Joshua heard that those people lived nigh unto them, he\nsaid unto them, “Why did ye come with deceit?” and then he made them servants of the\nhouse of God.  And when the five kings of the Amorites heard [this], they rose up against\nthe men of Gibeon, and the [Israelites] helped the people of Gibeon, and made a great\nslaughter of them.  And on those of them who fled God cast hailstones from heaven, and\nHe blotted them out.  And when the sun was nigh to set Joshua said before the children of\nIsrael.  “O sun, stand still over the city of Gibeon, and thou moon also over the city of\n‘Abakon.”  And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed firm, until God was avenged on\nHis enemies.   And Joshua divided the land of their inheritance among the children of\nIsrael, and he gave the priests cities to dwell in, and land for their beasts.  And he set apart\nsix cities of refuge wherein all those who had committed a murder unwittingly might\ndwell, according as God commanded him.   And when the days of Joshua were one\nhundred and ten years, and he had arrived at a good old age, he gathered together the\nchildren of Israel, and commanded them to keep the commandment of the Law of the\nTorah, and not to transgress it, and to be strong in the worship of God.  And he told them,\nsaying, “The Lord God is jealous, and if ye worship other [gods] He will blot you out\n\nquickly.”  And after this he died in peace and was buried in the grave, which Jacob bought\nfrom the children of Amer for a hundred sheep in the land of Nablos;

and many of the Jews and Gentiles believed through\nhis preaching.  And after this Lucianus the governor seized him, and tortured him with\ndivers kinds of severe tortures, and he cut open his sides with knives, and burned him with\nfiery torches.  And after this they took him outside the city, and the governor commanded\nthe soldiers to stone him with stones, and they stoned him; and he delivered up his soul\ninto the hands of our Lord Jesus Christ, for Whose Name he died.  Salutation to Ananias.\nAnd on this day also Saint Thomas, of the city of Sandalat, became a martyr.  When the\ndays of this saint from the city of Sandalat were eleven years, Michael, the angel of God,\nappeared unto him when he was asleep in a field; now he was a swineherd, and he\ncommended him to go and to confess our Lord Jesus Christ; and he rose up, and taking\nwith him only a whip of string, he departed to the city of Alexandria, and confessed our\nLord Jesus Christ before its governor.   And the governor said unto him, “Worship the\nidols,” and he promised to make him his scribe if he did so; and Saint Thomas was wroth\nwith him, and he shook out that whip of string, and beat the governor severely with it. \nAnd the governor had him seized, and tortured very severely, and he cut his body with iron\nsaws; and the saint begged for help from our Lord Jesus Christ, Who sent His angel to\nhim, and healed his wounds.  And the governor having shut him up in prison, the keeper of\nthe prison asked him to heal his son who was sick, and the saint gave him the whip of\nstring, and said unto him, “Lay this upon thy son, and by the might of God he shall recover\nstraightway”; and the keeper of the prison did as the saint commanded him, and his son\nrecovered forthwith.  When the governor heard of this he had the saint brought before him,\nand he said unto him, “Sacrifice to the idols”; and, laughing at him, the saint said [that he\nwould do so].  And the governor rejoiced exceedingly, and took him with him, and carried\nhim to the house of idols.  And the saint asked our Lord Jesus Christ to destroy the idols,\nand straightway they were smashed in pieces.  And the devil who was over them leaped\nupon the governor, and choked him until he confessed, saying, “There is no god except the\nLord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Living God.”  When the people saw this, they marveled\nexceedingly and they cried out, saying, “There is no god except the Lord Jesus Christ.” \nAnd after this those who had not believed shut the saint up in a dark cave, wherein he\nremained for fifteen days without food and drink; and the angel of God used to visit him. \nThen they hung him up, head downwards, until much blood ran down out of his mouth;\nand the angel of God came down and delivered him.  And a certain woman had a blind\nson, and she took some of the blood, and smeared it upon the eyes of her son, and he\nreceived his sight straightway.  And after this the governor shut the saint up in prison for a\nfew days.  Then he had him brought out, and the soldiers set a lioness at him, and she\ncame to him and licked his feet; and they also smote him upon his mouth with iron goads. \nNow there were with him under the torture Saint Babnuda, of the city of Bandara, and\nSaint Moses from the city of Balkim, and they encouraged each other to endure.  And after\nthis they boiled oil and pitch together, and poured it over the head of Saint Thomas, and no\ninjury happened to him.  And they also mutilated him, and made him put on the iron boots,\nand hung a large stone from his neck.  When they were tired of torturing him, Arianus the\ngovernor took him with him to bring him to the city of Antinoe.  And when they arrived at\nTaw, they cut off the head of Saint Thomas, and he received the crown of martyrdom in\nthe kingdom of the heavens.  And those who were tortured with him during the days of his\n\ntorture were six (or, seven) hundred men and nine women.  Salutation to Thomas, and\nsalutation to those who were tortured with him;

This man was of the number of those who subscribed the statement that this\nfather was [not] worthy of the office of the archiepiscopate.  And they drove out this father\nto the city of Germanos, and he dwelt there for three months.  And Abba Severus was\nordained in the country of Egypt in those days, and he comforted this father, and reminded\nhim that tribulation came upon the apostles, and also on John, the Mouth of Gold (i.e.\nChrysostom).  Then this father went to the city of Malig, and dwelt there for two years. \nAnd the men of the city of Alexandria rose up against the governor, and demanded their\nshepherd, and he brought back this father Theodosius to his office, and expelled\nAcacianus.  And the story of him was heard by the Emperor Justinian from the God-loving\nEmpress Theodora; and she wrote a letter, saying, “He who was first appointed shall sit in\nhis office.”   And one hundred and twenty priests formed themselves into a General\nCouncil, and they subscribed a statement, saying, “Abba Theodosius was first appointed.” \nAnd straightway Acacianus rose up before the people, and said, “I have transgressed; evil\nmen force me.”   And then the people asked this father to remove the ban of\nexcommunication from Acacianus provided that he would promise never again to minister\nas priest or deacon; and Acacianus agreed to this, and Theodosius removed the ban of\nexcommunication from him.  Now the emperor was corrupt in his faith, and he imagined\nthat Archbishop Abba Theodosius agreed with him in his evil faith.  And he wrote a letter\nof his officers who were in the city of Alexandria, and said unto them, “If the Archbishop\nTheodosius is at one with us in our belief, let another office be added to his\narchiepiscopate, and let him be governor of the city of Alexandria; but if he be not at one\nwith us in belief, he shall go forth from his office.”  And when this father heard these\nwords he said, “Thus said Satan to our Lord Christ in the desert, I will give thee all the\nkingdom of the world and the glory thereof, if thou wilt worship me” (Matthew iv, 9). \nAnd Saint Abba Theodosius rose up and went forth from the city of Alexandria, and\ndeparted into Upper Egypt, and he dwelt there for a few days, strengthening the believing\npeople in the True Faith.  And the emperor heard that the saint had gone forth from the city\nof Alexandria, and he sent him a letter to persuade him, saying, “I want to meet you, I\nwant thee to bless me and to give me counsel.”   And Abba Theodosius went to\nConstantinople, and the archbishop, and all the people, and the soldiers went forth to\nwelcome him; and they set him upon a high throne, and disputed concerning the True\nFaith.   And the emperor continued to persuade the saint for many days, but the saint\nvanquished him with the words of the Holy Scriptures, and with the words of the Fathers. \nAnd when he would not agree with him, the emperor expelled him from his throne and\nsent him to Upper Egypt; and he appointed in his place another man whose name was\nPaul.  And when that Paul came to the city of Alexandria, the people would not receive\nhim, and he remained for a whole year, but only a very few people received the Offering\nfrom his hands.  When the emperor heard of this he commanded the soldiers to shut the\nchurches until the people submitted to Paul the archbishop, and the believers used to go\noutside the city to the church of Saint Mark the evangelist, and to the church of Cosmas\nand Damian, and partake of the Offering, and have their children baptized with Christian\nBaptism; and when the emperor heard this he had the churches opened.   When Abba\nTheodosius heard this he was afraid that the emperor would lead them astray, and he wrote\na letter to the people which was full of every kind of consolation, and he sent it to them,\nand strengthened them in the True Faith, saying, “Take good heed and submit not\nyourselves to that heretic Paul.”  And Theodosius remained in exile in Upper Egypt for\n\neight and twenty years, and he lived in the city of Alexandria four years; and all the days\nof his life (sic) were two and thirty years.  And this father composed many Homilies and\nTreatises of Doctrine, and the believers in the country of Egypt continued to be called\n“Theodosians” until the days of Abba Jacob, [when] they were called “Jacobites.”  And\nhaving finished his good course he died in peace.  Salutation to Theodosius.\nAnd on this day also Basil and Bifantius became martyrs.\nAnd on this day also took place the consecration of the house (church) of Abba Timothy in\nthe city of Damanhur.   Salutation to the consecration of thy house.   [Omitted in the\nBodleian MS.] \nAnd on this day also are commemorated Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  Salutation to\nAbraham, Isaac, and Israel-Jacob.  [Omitted in the Bodleian MS.]\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and our Lord Jesus Christ\ncame down to him, and strengthened him, and raised him up sound and uninjured, even as\nhe was at first.  And then his mother came and comforted him, and she rejoiced in his\nstrife; and one told the governor about her.  And he had the mother of the saint brought,\nand he said unto her, “Sacrifice to the idols,” and he raged at her, and [tried] to frighten\nher; but she was not afraid of his raging, and she would not obey him.  And he commanded\nthe soldiers to make iron rods red-hot in the fire, and to lay them on her sides, and when\nthey did so she rejoiced, and sang hymns to the Living God, and she ascribed holiness to\nHim, and glorified Him because He had held her to be worthy to suffer for His Holy\nName.  And after this she delivered up her soul, whilst she was under torture, and she\nreceived the crown of martyrdom.   And as for Saint Abba Hor they boiled him in a\ncauldron he praised God and was without pain.  And they informed the governor of this,\n\nand he marveled exceedingly, and he was frightened and became filled with wrath.  And\nhe rose up and came to the cauldron, having a spear in his hand, and he drove his spear\ninto the breast of the holy man, who delivered up his soul into the hand of God, and\nreceived the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  And they also tortured\nhis brother Abba Besoi very severely, and they cut off his head with the sword, and he\nreceived the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  Salutation to thee O\nBesoi, the soldier, and to thy brother Hor.\nAnd on this day also died Mark, Emperor of Rome.  This saint reigned in his virginity for\nfive years, and he ruled his people justly and righteously.   And then when the people\nforced him to marry a wife, he went by night into the church, and stood up before the\npicture of the holy two-fold Virgin Mary, and he said unto her, “O my Lady, guide thou me\nin the way wherein I should walk”;

And straightway grace was taken from\nhim, and his eye became black, and he did not look at her again.  Then having roused\nhimself from the drunken stupor of error, he knew at once that he had sinned, and that the\nwoman was one of the deceits of Satan, the accursed Adversary, by whom he had been\novercome.  Then he wrote down what had befallen him, and everything which he had done\nin the body, and he took one of the stones on the island, and he beat his breast therewith\ncontinually until he died.  And his soul departed to everlasting life.  And then the people of\nthat district came, according to their wont, to be blessed by him, and when they found him\nnot, they went through his habitation, and found him lying prostrate; and it seemed to them\nthat he was sleeping, but when they tried to wake him they found that he was dead.  Then\nthey kissed him, and prepared him for burial, and they buried him in the earth.  And they\nfound the writing wherein he had written what had happened unto him through the\noperations of Satan, and what were the reasons for his death.  Salutation to Abba Geran.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and Ahab said unto\nNaboth, “Give me this thy vineyard so that it may become the place of an oil press, for it\nis nigh unto my house, and I will give thee gold, the price of thy vineyard.”  And Naboth\nsaid unto Ahab, “God forbid that I should give thee the inheritance of my fathers”; and\nAhab was very sorry and he went and lay down upon his bed, and he covered his face and\nrefused to eat.  And Jezebel his wife came unto him and said, “What maketh thee so sorry\nthat thou dost not eat?”  And he said unto her, “I talked with Naboth and I said unto him,\n‘Give me thy vineyard at a price’; and he said, ‘I will not give my father’s inheritance for\ngold.’”  And Jezebel said unto him, “Dost thou thus act the king for Israel?  Rise up and\neat and I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”  And she wrote a letter in\nAhab’s name, and she sealed it with his seal, and she sent that letter to the elders of the\ncity who lived with Naboth, and in it she spoke thus, “Proclaim ye a fast, and place\nNaboth before the people, and set up two men, sons of inequity, who shall say, ‘He cursed\nGod and the king’; then take him outside [the city] and stone him to death.”  And the men\nof the city did according to the message which Jezebel sent to them, and they proclaimed\na fast and they set Naboth before the people, and two men, sons of iniquity, came, and\nthey testified against Naboth, saying, “He cursed God and the king”; and then they took\nhim outside the city and stoned him and he died.  Salutation to Naboth who was killed by\nKing Ahab for the sake of his vineyard.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Peter of the city of Gaza.  This holy man\nwas a native of the city of Roha (Edessa) and belonged to a noble family, and his parents\ngave him to the Emperor Theodosius so that he might appoint him a governor, and he\nmade him a governor.   And he renounced rank and glory, and fought spiritually and\ndevoted himself to the worship of God in the palace of the emperor, and he had with him\nsome of the bodies of the holy martyrs from the country of Persia; now at that time his\ndays were twenty years.  Then he went out and became a monk in a certain monastery, and\nhe fought a great spiritual fight.  When the bishops heard of his holiness, and his spiritual\nstrife, they took him and against his will made him Bishop of Gaza and all the\n\nneighboring district.   And it is said of him that when he read the Office for the\nconsecration of the Offering, so much blood flowed from the Offering that [the vessel]\nwas filled with His Blood.   And when they brought the body of Saint James the\n“dismembered” he took it and dwelt in one of the monasteries of Jerusalem.  And it came\nto pass in the days of Marcion the heretic that he fled to the land of Egypt, and with him\nwas the body of James the “dismembered”; and he dwelt in a monastery for some days.\nOnce when he was preparing to consecrate the Offering certain men who were standing\nthere talked together at the time of the preparation, but Saint Peter did not rebuke them.\nAnd he saw the angel of the Lord holding him back from them, and he wished to cast\nhimself down on the ground for he honored them and was afraid to rebuke them.  When\nthe days of Marcion the infidel were ended, Saint Peter returned to the land of Palestine. \nAnd he strengthened the churches, and the people foregathered with him, and they\nassembled about Isaiah the Egyptian.   And the report of him was heard by Zeno the\nemperor, and he wished to see him, but Peter neither wished it nor desired it, because he\nfled from the affairs of this fleeting world.  Then he came to the shore of the lake (or sea)\nof Gawer and dwelt there.  And there came the feast of Saint Peter, Archbishop of the city\nof Alexandria, and he made arrangements to consecrate the church on the day of his\nfestival.  And Saint Peter appeared unto him and said, “Behold, our Lord Christ will call\nthee to come to us,” and from that day Saint Peter knew the time of his death.  And he\nsummoned the people to him, and he commanded them to be strong in the True Faith; then\nhe stretched out his hand, and delivered up his soul into the hand of God.  Salutation to\nPeter, for when he broke the bread of the Offering blood distilled there from until the\nwhole of the paten was filled therewith.\nAnd on this day died the holy father Abba John, the thirtieth (sic) Archbishop of the city\nof Alexandria.  This holy man was a priest, and he was a native of the city of Gamnudi. \nAnd in the days of this father the church of Sergius and Bacchus, the holy martyrs, was\nbuilt, and also the church of ‘Abukir and the church of John in the inner wall of Mesr\n(Cairo).   And a certain God-fearing man, an Egyptian, a Jacobite, whose name was\nAndrias, and who was a scribe of Abdal-Aziz, and son of Merwan, took care of them. \nAnd it was this father Abba John who was building the church of Saint Mark the\nevangelist in the city of Alexandria, which is known as “Kamos” for a period of three\nyears in the days of King Adel.  And during the days of this father a great famine, [which\nlasted] for three years, took place.  And he was careful for the poor, and the needy, and\nthose who were in misery, and he used to give them silver and bread twice a week, and he\ngave many alms and gifts to the poor, and was a doer of good works.  In his days the\nKhalifah Yazid died, and Merwan reigned in his stead.  This father sat upon the throne of\nMark the evangelist for nine years, and he died in peace.  Salutation to Archbishop John\nwith whom, on the day of his death, is associated the Patriarch Athanasius.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Athanasius, the seventy-third (or seventy-sixth)\nArchbishop of the city of Alexandria, who was known as Paul, the son of the priest\nMakram, the son of Kalil, and Peter, and James the Persian, and Elijah the monk, and\nBarsabeh (Bathsabeh), the mother of Solomon.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

now Joachim her husband was an old man.  And God heard their cry. \nAnd the blessed Hannah vowed a vow to God, saying, “The fruit which He shall give me I\nwill devote to God.”  And having brought forth our Lady Mary she reared her for three\nyears in her house, and after this she took her to live with the virgins in the Sanctuary of\nGod.   And Mary dwelt in the Sanctuary for twelve years, and received her sustenance\nfrom the hands of angels, until the time when our Lord Christ came into the world, and\ntook flesh from her, the elect of all women.  And when she had completed twelve years in\nthe Sanctuary, the priests took counsel together about her so that they might give her unto\none who would protect her, for she was vowed to God, and it was not right in their sight\nthat she should blossom in the Sanctuary and become after the manner of women therein. \nThen they called her by a name of honor for him that should be worthy to see her.  And\nZachariah, the high priest, answered and said, “Bring Mary hither so that I may find out\nwhat is in her heart”; and they called her and she came and stood before him.   And\nZachariah said, “Know, O Mary, that thou hast grown up and that thou art mature like any\nother woman.  Dost thou wish to be married?  [If so] we will seek out for thee a good, and\nblessed, and God-fearing young man, and we will marry thee to him.  Or, wouldst thou\nrather remain in the Sanctuary and minister unto God all the days of thy life?  [If so] we\nwill lay upon thee the prohibition which is written in the Torah that thou salt not approach\nthe gates of the Sanctuary during the days wherein there happeneth to thee what\nhappeneth to women.”  And our Lady Mary answered and said unto him, “Behold, I am\nthe handmaiden of the Lord before you; I have neither father nor mother.  Ye are to me in\nthe place of my father and my mother before God, holy and blessed be His Name!  What\nye know to be the command of God in respect of me that do for me.”  And the priests and\nall the Sanhedrim said unto Zachariah the priest, “Go to the Sanctuary and pray to God,\nand God shall make it clear to thee concerning Mary.”  And Zachariah put on his priestly\nvestments, and went into the Sanctuary, and prayed to God concerning Mary.  And the\nangel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him, “Zachariah, go forth and gather\ntogether all the men and old men, and take their staffs, and write the name of each man\nupon his staff.  Then gather together all the staffs into the Sanctuary, and pray to God; and\nafter this go forth and give unto each man his staff.  And the man on whose staff the Lord\nGod shall make a sign to appear is he who is worthy that Mary shall be given unto him to\nprotect.”  And Zachariah the priest went forth and told the assembly what the angel of\nGod had said unto him.  And straightway he sent criers out into every land of Israel and\ninto the cites and villages, and they cried out, saying, “Let every man of the House of\nDavid, whether he be young or old, whose wife is dead, go to Jerusalem.”  When Joseph\nof the House of David heard this he took his staff and went from Nazareth to Jerusalem,\nwhere he found very many men gathered together.  And Zachariah the priest took all their\nstaffs and wrote their names upon them and the staffs were in number seventeen hundred\nand eighty-five.  And he prayed to God inside the Sanctuary, and all the men who were\nstanding outside the Sanctuary prayed likewise.   And when Zachariah had finished his\nprayer he brought out the staffs, and gave unto every man the staff, which belonged to\nhim.  When Joseph, the carpenter, drew nigh to take his staff, there appeared from out of it\nthe form of a white dove and it flew up and stood upon his head.  And when the priests\nand all the people saw this they marveled exceedingly and they glorified God greatly.\n\nAnd Zachariah said unto Joseph, “Take Mary the Virgin and keep her in thy house, even\nas the angel of the Lord saith”;

and he had with him Philemon, his disciple, who had a sweet\nvoice, and he was wise, and a good reader, and pious.   And Andrew the apostle\ncommanded him to go up on the top of certain steps and to read (or sing) in a sweet voice,\nand he went up and read in a sweet voice.  And when the priests of the idols heard of the\ncoming of Andrew the apostle, they rose up and took their weapons of war and went to the\nchurch so that they might hear whether [the Christians] cursed their gods [or not].  And\nwhen they heard Philemon reading and saying, “The gods of the nations are gold and\nsilver, the work of men’s hands.  They have mouths and speak not, they have eyes and see\nnot, they have ears and hear not, they have noses and smell not, they have hands and\nhandle not, they have feet and walk not, they cry not out with their throats, and there is no\nbreath in their mouths.  May those who make them and those who put their trust in them\nbecome like unto them!”  (Psalm cxv).  And through his beautiful voice and the sweetness\nof his words their hearts were opened, and they came into the church, and bowed down at\nthe feet of Andrew the apostle, and they believed on our Lord Jesus Christ.   And the\napostle taught them the doctrine of the Church and baptized them with Christian baptism;\nand many of those who worshipped idols believed with them.  After this Satan came into\nthe city and he found playing together two youths, one of whom was the son of John, the\npriest of the city, and the other the son of one of the great men of the city.  And whilst one\nof them was amusing himself with the other he smote the other a blow, and he died.  And\nthe father [of the dead boy] made a charge against [the father of the living boy] and he\nsaid unto him, “Bring me thy son so that I may kill him in the place of my son whom he\nkilled.”  When John heard this he was very sorry, and he said unto the men of the city, “Be\nsurety for me whilst I go to my father Andrew who shall come and raise up the boy who is\ndead” and they became surety for him.  And John the priest came to Saint Andrew and he\nfound him baptizing all the people.  And Andrew answered and said unto him, “I cannot\ngo with thee at this moment because of the people whom I have to baptize, but take\nPhilemon with thee, and he shall raise for thee the boy who is dead.”  So Philemon and\nJohn the priest departed from Andrew, and when he came to the city of Nawa [he found]\nKoros the governor searching for the murderer, for Satan had told him all that had\nhappened, and he imagined that a grown up man [had been killed].  And the people said\nunto Philemon, “Go not into the city lest the governor kill thee”; and Philemon said, “I\ncannot transgress the command of my lord and teacher, but I must go and raise him up;\nand if they kill me my teacher will come and raise me up and him that is dead likewise.” \nSo Philemon came into the city, and he met Koros the governor who commanded his\nguards to kill him.  And the governor said, “Who knoweth whether this man killed the boy\nwho is dead [or not]?”  And the guards went to kill Philemon, and they seized him and\nhung him up.  And Philemon answered and said unto Koros the governor, “Why dost thou\nscourge me?  I am a little person who hath done no sin, and torturing ought not to be\ninflicted upon me.  Where is Andrew my teacher that he may see what they are doing to\nhis disciple?”  And he turned his face to the guards, and said unto them, “Is there anyone\namong you who is merciful and will take compassion upon me, and will go to my teacher\nAndrew and will tell him in what state I am, how I am scourged and hung up [upon a\ntree]?”  When the guards heard this they wept because of the sweetness of his voice.  And\nstraightway certain birds came and talked with him as they talked to Noah in days of old,\nand they said unto him, “Behold, whatsoever thou wishest from us we will send unto\n\nthee.”  And a small bird came nigh unto him, and she said unto him, “I am lighter in body\nthan these [other] birds, and I will go to thy teacher to bring him to thee.”  And Philemon\nsaid unto her, “Thou art a whore, and thou shalt not tempt me.  Get thee gone from me,\nand if thou canst find anyone of thy kin dwell with her, and return not in a hurry\nspeedily.”  And a raven drew nigh unto him and said unto him, “I will go to him.”  And\nPhilemon said unto the raven, “In days of old when thou wast sent [from the ark] thou\ndidst not return to report to Noah who sent thee forth, and shall I send thee?”   And\nPhilemon called the dove and said unto her, “O excellent pilgrim, whom God hath named\nas the gentlest of all the birds who brought news to Noah, when he was in the ark during\nthe days of the Flood, and whom our father Noah, the righteous man, blessed, get thee to\nthe country of Leda (Leda) to my teacher Andrew and tell him to come hither and see his\ndisciple Philemon, whom they have hung upon a tree to scourge him.”  And the dove went\nand told Andrew and she returned and answered and said unto Philemon, “Be strong and\nfear not; behold Andrew is coming and he will hear thy word.”  When Koros the governor\nheard this, he rose up quickly and he released Philemon with his own hands from the\nscourging, and he believed on our Lord. And Satan was jealous, and he entered into the\nheart of the governor’s wife and she killed her sons, and her slaves returned and seized\nher, and they told the governor and Philemon.  And Philemon called the dove and sent\nmany messages into the house of the governor [by her].  And when the people heard the\ndove talking, they were amazed, and they all thronged to the place where Philemon was. \nAnd behold Andrew came and commanded Philemon his disciple to raise the dead youth,\nand he prayed to our Lord Christ and raised the young man from the dead.  And they went\nalso into the house of the governor, and Saint Andrew prayed and made his wife and his\nsons, who were dead, to live.  And the youth who came to life told everything that had\nhappened [to him] and what he had seen in heaven.   And behold whilst the dove was\nflying about Andrew’s head and in front of him, the apostle said unto her, “How many are\nthy days?” and the dove said unto him, “Sixty years are my days.”   And the blessed\nAndrew said unto her, “Because thou didst hearken to the voice of Philemon, my disciple,\nget thee into the desert, and thou shalt be free from the work of the men of this world, and\nno man shall have any authority over thee”; and the dove went forth into the desert as\nAndrew commanded.  And when the people who were gathered together saw this, they all\nbelieved and were baptized in the Name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost. \nThen he went forth from them and departed to the cities of Akrad, and Aksis, and\nAkseyas, and Henefores, and after this he departed with Bartholomew to Azri-Gazrinos;\nand what happened to him [from the time when he met] the Dog-faces until he returned is\nin the knowledge of God [only].  When Saint Andrew had entered that city and preached\nto the people thereof, now these men were exceedingly evil, and they would neither\nsubmit nor obey, some of them believed because of the signs and wonders which they saw\n[worked] by Saint Andrew.  And those who did not believe took counsel with evil intent\nagainst Saint Andrew, and they sent a message to him with deceit asking him to come,\nmeaning to rise up against him and to kill him.  When their messengers came to Saint\nAndrew, and heard his good doctrine, and saw his shining face, they believed on our Lord\nChrist, and returned to those who had sent them.  And there were some who tortured them,\nand these belonged to those evil men who had taken counsel together, saying, “We will\nrise up and burn him in the fire.”  And there gathered together about him many evil men,\nand they came to Saint Andrew to kill him.  And the blessed man asked Christ that fire\nmight come down from heaven and consume them, and straightway fire came down from\nheaven and burnt them up; and those who were left were exceedingly afraid.  And the\nreport of the blessed Andrew the apostle was heard throughout all that country and many\npeople believed on our Lord Christ.   And the priests of idols saw all these signs and\nwonders and did not believe, but they sought out Saint Andrew the apostle in all that\ncountry that they might kill him.  Afterwards they gathered together and came and took\nthe holy Apostle Andrew, and they beat him severely and dragged him round about the\ncity naked, and they cast him into the prison house, so that they might kill him on the\nfollowing day.  Now the custom of these people was when they wanted to kill a man to\ntake him and hang him up on a tree, and stone him until he died. That day Andrew the\napostle asked our Lord Christ that fire might come down upon them from heaven and\nconsume them as it did before.  And our Lord Christ appeared and said unto him, “Be not\n\nafraid, be not sorrowful, be not dismayed, for thy departure from this world is nigh”; and\nHe gave him “Peace,” and disappeared from him; and the soul of the blessed Andrew the\napostle rejoiced.  When the morning came they hung him up upon a tree and stoned him\nwith stones until he died.  And certain believing men came and took the body of the saint\nand laid it in a grave, and great signs and wonders were made manifest.  Salutation to\nthee, O disciple of Jesus, who preached the Gospel and taught in Nicomedia, and who\nroused up the country of Leda (Leda) from the dead.\nOn this day are commemorated Abba ‘Os and the Virgins, and James, and Zachariah, and\nSimon, and Theodora, and Theophana.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and a certain woman who had a devil in her came to\nher, and Saint Eugenius healed her.  After this Satan cast an evil lust into the heart of a\ncertain woman so that she spoke to Saint Eugenius, and asked him to abandon his ascetic\nlife and marry her.  And Saint Eugenius hearkened unto her voice and said unto her, “Get\nthee from me, O my mother, for Satan hath afflicted thee.”  And having been put to shame\nthe woman departed to the governor of Alexandria, and she said unto him, “When I visited\na certain religious house a young man came unto me by night, a monk, and he wished to\nput me to shame, and when I cried out to my slaves and to my handmaidens, he departed\nfrom me.”   When the governor, the father of Eugenia, heard this he commanded the\nsoldiers to bring the monks before him bound in fetters.  and when they arrived he handed\n\nthem over to another governor to punish in his house, and some of them died.  And when\nSaint Eugenius saw the miserable condition of the monks she said unto the governor, her\nfather, “O my lord, swear unto me that if I tell thee the mystery which concerns me that\nthou wilt not hold me back from my desire.”  And when he had sworn to her she took him\ninto a secret place and showed him her mystery, and told him her desire and that she was\nhis daughter Eugenia.  When the governor heard this he said unto her, “Art thou indeed\nEugenia my daughter?  I will believe in thy God.”  And straightway he commanded them\nto set free the monks and to bury those who were dead.  And her father and her mother\nand all the men of her house were baptized in the Name of the Father and the Son and the\nHoly Ghost, One God, and became Christians.  When the men of Alexandria saw the Faith\nof Philip, they enthroned him archbishop on the throne of Mark, and he sat for many\nyears, and taught the Faith of Christ.  And another governor, an evil man (or heretic), sent\nhis soldiers to kill Philip secretly whilst he was praying in church; and they killed him and\nhe became a martyr.  And when the Archbishop of Rome heard the story of Saint Eugenia,\nhe received her into his house and made her abbess of the religious house which he had\nbuilt, and which contained three thousand women, and three hundred nuns who were\nvirgins; and the two eunuchs who were with her he made bishops of the cities.  And the\ngovernor seized Saint Eugenia and tortured her with divers kinds of tortures, and at length\nshe delivered up her soul and became a martyr, for the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to\nWhom be praise!  Salutation to Theodore and to Eugenia.\nAnd on this day also Saint Victor of the city of Shaw, in the district of Asyut, became a\nmartyr.  The name of the father of this holy man was Marmar, and the name of his mother\nwas Martha, and they were righteous folk and they served God without fear.  Now they\nhad no son, and they prayed for one continually, and gave large alms to the poor and\nneedy.   And God heard their petition, and that year the blessed woman conceived this\nblessed Victor, and she brought him forth on the ninth day of Genbot (May-June); and she\nbrought him up most carefully and piously in the fear of God.  When he was twenty years\nold his father took him to the emperor, and the emperor made him a judge in his father’s\nstead; now his father was far advanced in years.  Then after a few days there arrived the\nEdict of the Emperor Diocletian to the governor of Ansna (Asna or Esneh), ordering him\nto kill the Christians who would not worship the gods; and the governor himself came to\nthe city of Shaw, seeking for Christians.  And certain men informed against Saint Victor,\nand told the governor that he worshipped Christ . . . in sincerity, and the governor\nforthwith ordered his soldiers to bring him to him; and they did so and set him before\nhim.  And the governor tried to force Saint Victor to sacrifice to the gods, and when he\nrefused to do so, he commanded his soldiers to bind him in fetters in the prison house. \nAnd as he was praying there the angel of the Lord, Saint Michael, came down to him and\ncarried him up into heaven; and when the keeper of the prison house missed him he was\nexceedingly disturbed.  And after three days he found him, and took him to the governor\nwho took him to the Emperor Diocletian, he himself being pitiful and tender-hearted\nconcerning him, so that he might turn him from the worship of God.  And having become\nweary and being unable to make Saint Victor consent, he sent him and deposited him with\nthe governor Eutychianus, saying, “I have sent him to thee.  If he offers sacrifice to the\ngods [good and well], and if he will not, hesitate not to kill him.”  Then the soldiers tied\nhis hands and his feet, and put an iron gag in his mouth, and he commanded them to put\nhim in the hold of a ship; and they took him away.  Whilst he was there the angel of the\nLord came down and released him from his fetters.  Then they brought him before the\ngovernor, and the saint kept silent before the governor as before the wicked emperor; and\nstraightway the governor was wroth and condemned him to be tortured severely, and\nchained him in the prison house.  Whilst he was there our Redeemer appeared in a chariot\nof light, and made a covenant with him.  And from that day the saint performed many\nsigns and miracles, and healed all the sick. When the governor heard this he was wroth,\nand commanded his soldiers to bring him to him, and he treated him kindly and urged him\n[to worship the gods]; but the saint reviled him and cursed his filthy gods.   And\nstraightway he commanded them to tie him to a horse’s tail and drag him about for one\nday, and after that they threw him into the furnace which heated the baths, and he finished\nhis strife nobly.  Now they could not bring his body out from the bath furnace, so they\n\nwent down the steps, and wrapped it up in costly cloths and anointed it with scented\nunguents and they built a church over it.  Salutation two-fold to Saint Victor.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Philip, and Ananias, and Barachus, and John, and\nPhilip, the father of Eugenia the martyr.\nSalutation to Eugenia who pretended that she was a eunuch for the sake of Christ, and\nwho appeared to be like the monks her fellows.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and he excommunicated those who took concubines, and he was wroth with\nthose who had them.  And when those who had concubines heard the excommunication\nwhich he pronounced against them, they feared the banning of the archbishop very\ngreatly, and they feared God the Most High, and they cast out all their concubines from\ntheir houses, and came to Abba Abraham the archbishop, and bowed down at his feet and\nrepented; and he accepted their repentance and remitted unto them all their sins.  And no\nman dared to gainsay the archbishop except a certain man who was a scribe in Mesr\n(Cairo), and he feared neither God Most High nor this father.  And this father rebuked him\nmany times, and he bore with him for many days, but although he bowed low before him\nmany times he would not accept his rebuke, nor turn from his evil way, and he was not\nafraid lest God Most High should destroy him.  And although he saw a pure and holy old\nman lying prone on the ground at his feet, (which ought to have been cut off!), beseeching\nhim to turn from his evil, and to cast out that concubine from his house, he neither listened\nto his command nor turned and forsook his counsel.  And even after this the archbishop\nconsidered neither his own learning (?), nor his rebuke, but he humbled himself like Christ\nhis Creator, and he went to the house of that man.  And when that infidel heard of the\ncoming of this father to his house, he shut the door, and this father remained for two hours\nstanding at the door of that evil man and knocking at it; and the man neither opened the\ndoor to him nor spoke one word.  And when this father heard that the wretched man had\nseparated himself from the community, and was alone, and that of his own free will he had\nperished from the flock of Christ, and that all his members were rotten, than and then\nonly, not because of the sin which he had committed against this father, but in order that\nthe rest of the members of his flock might not be corrupted, this father rightly decided to\ncut him away from his congregation, and to set his blood on his own head, and he\nexcommunicated him, and shook off the dust from the sandals on his feet at the door of\nthe house of that unclean man.  And God made manifest at that moment a sign in the\npresence of the men who were there, for the framework of the door and the large stone\nwere split asunder and became two parts.  What an awful and marvelous thing was this! \nWhen the massive, solid stone heard the excommunication of this father it split asunder. \nAnd the fate, which came upon this man who was full of sin, was not tender, for God\nworked grievous signs upon that man, and he became the poorest of the poor.  And He\nremoved him from his position in disgrace, and of all his possessions he had not left to\nhim one sarik (i.e. farthing); and God afflicted his body with serious illness, and [the\nsoldiers] cut off his hands in the days of Hakim the Khalifah.  And he became a spectacle\nunto all men, and many sinners were afraid when they saw an evil death come upon him,\nand they repented.  And in the days of this holy father, Me’ez (Al-Mu’izz) the Khalifah of\n\nMesr (Cairo), the captain of his host was a certain Jew who embraced with him the\nMuslim Faith, and he became like unto the Muslims; and that captain had a friend, a Jew,\nwho used to come with him frequently and hold converse with the khalifah.  And when\nthat Jew found favor with the khalifah, because of his friendship with the captain of the\nhost of the khalifah, he made a request to the khalifah, and he said unto him, “I very much\nwish that thou wouldst bring the archbishop to me so that I might have an argument with\nhim.”  And the khalifah sent and brought this father, and with him was Severus, the son of\nMakfue, Bishop of the city of Eshmunen.   And they disputed with that Jew, and\nvanquished him in argument and put him to shame.   When the khalifah saw this he\nrejoiced, and he was pleased with the archbishop and those who were with him, and paid\nthem honor and they departed to their houses in peace.  And the captain of the host and\nthat Jew friend were ashamed, and they were seeking to kill the archbishop and all the\nChristians.  One day the captain of the host came to the khalifah and said unto him, “I\nwould have thee to know, O my lord, that the Christians have no Faith, for it saith in their\nGospel, ‘If there be in you faith as large as a mustard-seed, and ye say to this mountain,\nDepart and fall into the sea, it shall depart from this world.’”   And when the khalifah\nheard this he sent and brought the Archbishop Abba Abraham, and he said unto him,\n“What hast thou to say to the words in your Gospel which saith, ‘If there be in you faith as\nlarge as a mustard-seed, and ye say to this mountain Depart, and it shall depart’?”  And the\nArchbishop said unto him, “Yea, it is true, the Gospel doth say this” (Matthew xvii, 20). \nAnd the khalifah said unto him, “Behold, there are thousands and tens of thousands of\nthousands of you Christians in whom there is faith.  I wish you to bring to me one of your\nnumber to make manifest this sign to me with his own hand, not thyself who art the head\nof the Christian people, though it would be seemly for thee to make manifest this sign\nunto me with thine own hand.”  When the archbishop heard these words he was dismayed\nand feared exceedingly, and he said unto the khalifah, “Wait three days,” and he replied,\n“Let it be according as thou sayest.”   And the archbishop went out from before the\nkhalifah, and he gathered together the archbishops, and the bishops and the priests, and\nthe monks who lived near him, and they sat in the church of the holy Lady of us all, the\nVirgin Mary, in Mu’Allakah in Mesr (Cairo) for three days and three nights, fasting, and\npraying, and making supplication to God.  On the third night, at dawn, our holy Lady, the\nVirgin Mary, the God-bearer, appeared unto Abba Abraham with a bright and joyful face,\nand she said unto the archbishop, “What is it that hath come upon thee?”  And she said\nunto him, “Fear not, I have accepted all thy tears which thou hast shed in my church, and\nnow rise up, and get thee out into the ‘street of iron’ which leads into the market, and there\nthou shalt find a one-eyed man bearing a pot of water on his shoulders, lay hold upon him,\nfor he shall make manifest this sign unto thee.  And the name of this man is Simon, and he\nis a shoe-maker, and he put out his eye through the command of my Beloved Son Jesus\nChrist.”  And the archbishop rose up and went quickly, and he found the man, and laid\nhold upon him, and he said unto him, “Have mercy on the Christian folk.”  And he told\nhim how our holy Lady the Virgin Mary had appeared unto him, and how she had told\nhim about him.  And Simon bowed down before him and said unto him, “Forgive me, O\nmy father, I am a sinful man and a transgressor, and I cannot do what thou tellest me, but\nGod’s Will be done.  By the prayer of our holy Lady the Virgin Mary and by thine own\nprayer thou shalt help the Christian people.  But I beseech thee, O my father, not to reveal\nmy work unto any man, for I have not strength enough to bear this world’s honor; but\nwhat I say unto thee do.  Get thee out to the mountain about which the khalifah spoke unto\nthee, with thy priests, and let thy people be with thee, and take with thee the Gospels, and\nthe crosses, and the censers, and candles.  And let the khalifah and his soldiers and all the\npeople stand on one side, and do thou and thy people stand on the other side.  And I will\nstand behind thee among the people and none will know me, and let them entreat God,\nand say, and cry out, ‘Kiryalayson,’ that is to say, ‘God have mercy upon us, Christ,’ one\nand forty times, and then command thy people to hold their peace.  Then do thou bow\ndown, and let all the people bow down, and I myself will bow down with thee.  And do\nthis three times, at the same time making the sign of the Life-giving Cross before that\nmountain.”  When the archbishop heard this, he took the bishops, and the priests, and the\nmonks, and the believing people, and came to the khalifah.   And the khalifah and his\nsoldiers went out, and with them were all the people of Mesr (Cairo) and Kahera (Cairo),\n\nand they made haste to that mountain, and the Archbishop Abba Abraham and the\nbelieving men stood on one side, and the khalifah and his soldiers and all his men on the\nother side.  Then the archbishop and the believing men prayed, and Simon with them, and\nthey cried out, saying, “Lord have mercy upon us” one and forty times.  And when they\nhad bowed down three times, now at each time the archbishop lifted up his eyes to\nheaven, and made the sign of the Cross, the mountain moved itself and rose up in the air\nbefore all the people.  And when the archbishop and all the believing people bowed down,\nthe mountain descended to its place [again]; and thus he did three times.  And when the\nkhalifah and his soldiers and all the Muslims saw this sign and wonder, they marveled\nexceedingly, and they cried out loudly and were afraid with a great fear.  And the Khalifah\nbrought the archbishop Abba Abraham, and honored him greatly, and asked him to\ndemand from him whatsoever he wished, but he had no need to ask him for anything\nwhatsoever.  And when the khalifah pressed the archbishop, the archbishop said unto him,\n“I wish to build some churches, and especially a church [in honor of] Saint Mercurius in\nMesr (Cairo).”  And the khalifah commanded him to build what churches he wanted, and\nbesides this he gave him money from his palace, and paid him reverence.   And the\narchbishop said unto him, “May God lengthen thy days upon earth, and make strong thy\nkingdom; for myself I do not want money.”  And when he said this to him the khalifah\nloved him exceedingly, for he saw his righteousness proceeding from him in his rejection\nof the goods of this world.  Then the khalifah leaped upon his horse and [departed] with\nhis soldiers and he stood by the side of the archbishop at the building of the church of\nSaint Mercurius, when certain evil men would have prevented him building the church,\nand he stayed with him until he had finished building the church of Saint Mercurius, and\nmany other churches in the country of Egypt.   And having fought a good fight, and\npleased God, he died in peace, having sat upon the throne of Mark the evangelist for three\nyears and six months.  And one saith in the story of the life of this father that the scribe\nwhom he excommunicated because of his concubines concocted poison and poisoned\nhimself and he died.  And this saint departed to God Whom he loved, and all the people\nmourned for him.   Salutation to Abraham the merchant and archbishop.   Salutation to\nSimon who was instructed by the mouth of Mary.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated the consecration of the church of Saint ‘Arsima,\nthe virgin and martyr, and the translation of her body, and of the bodies of the holy\nmartyrs who were with her; now these were six and twenty holy martyrs.   And King\nTiridates said unto her, “Hath thy heart no desire to live as long as thou canst with us?”  \nAnd she said unto him, “My desire for heaven, which is better, is greater.”   And he\ncommanded his soldiers to take her to the fore part of the tent and to strip her naked there,\nand to cut off her head; and they cut off her head and she received the crown of\nmartyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  Salutation to the translation of the body of\n‘Arsima.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Batelsis the priest, and Abraham Soreyawi, the\nsecond, who was a carpenter, and a Christian, and Ta’Amani, and Sufit, and Meryan, and\nMichael, and Yolsawis and Ptolemy.\nSalutation to Elyab a pagan on whom God showed compassion.

And he brought Abba\nDaniel into his house, and welcomed him with joy, and when Daniel saw his goodness, he\nasked God to give money to Eulogius, so that he might be able to welcome the poor.  And\nour Lord appeared unto Daniel in the form of a child, and said unto him, “Wilt thou\nundertake his duties, and let him change his mode of life, or shall I undertake them?”  And\nthen Eulogius found a pot of gold, and he went to the emperor and was appointed a\ngovernor, and he abandoned his old habit of life.  And Abba Daniel heard in the city of the\nemperor that he (i.e. the emperor) had rebuked him, and that his soldiers had beaten\nEulogius and brought him nigh unto death; [and the emperor ordered them to crucify\nhim].  And whilst he was sorrowing over this matter that child appeared unto him in a\ndream, and said unto him, “Why hast thou entered into the affair of another?”  Then our\nLady Mary came and kissed the feet of the child and delivered Eulogius.  As for Eulogius,\nwhen another emperor reigned he wished to kill him, and Eulogius took to flight, and\nhaving arrived in the city, he returned to his former work.  And one day when they were\njourneying along the road by the light of the moon, he found a woman on a hill, and her\nhair covered her whole body, and she had dwelt there for eight and thirty years, carrying\non the spiritual fight, and she told him all her secret history and died.  And one day they\nbrought the Book of the Letters of Leo and read it before all the people, and Abba Daniel\nleaped up and rent the book and cursed the Faith of Chalcedon; and when the soldiers\nheard of this they beat him severely, and drove him away from his monastery.  One day he\nwas going to visit some virgins, and he knocked at the door, and they knew that he was\nAbba Daniel, and they opened the door to him and welcomed him with joy; and among\nthem was one who made herself out to be mad, and she lay by the door [and moved not]. \nAnd Abba Daniel asked about her, and the abbess said, “She is mad”; and Abba Daniel\ntold her that she was a holy woman and a spiritual fighter.  And during the night she wrote\na letter, saying, “Forgive me because I made you angry”; and having said this she\ndisappeared; and when the [other] virgins heard of this they were exceeding sorry and\nrepented.  And there was a nunnery wherein very many virgins dwelt, and its gates were\nstrong, and Satan raised up against them certain thieves to plunder their goods.  And the\ncaptain of the thieves said, “I will disguise myself as Abba Daniel, and they will open the\ndoor to me forthwith”; and he did even as he had thought.  And he said unto the virgins, “I\nam Abba Daniel,” and when the nuns heard him they welcomed him with joy, and\nuncovered their faces.  And as soon as one of the nuns, who was blind, washed her face in\nwater her eyes were opened; and when the nuns saw this they said, “Blessed art thou, O\nAbba Daniel!”  When the captain of the thieves saw this he repented, and became a monk\nwith Abba Daniel.  And Abba Daniel continued to fight strenuously, and when the time for\nhis departure drew nigh the angel of the Lord told him, and he fell sick a little; and he\n\nprayed to Christ and died in peace.   Salutation to Daniel, the head of the blessed\npriesthood of Dabra Sihat (monastery of Scete ?).\nAnd on this day also is commemorated the blessed woman Diyonteres (Diontyras). \nSalutation to Diyonteres (Diontyras).\nAnd on this day also died the holy and glorious father and fighter Abba Matewos\n(Matthew) of ‘Asfoni, Archimandrite of Dabra ‘Aswan.  And this holy man was reared\nfrom his youth up in the fear of God, and he became a monk in a certain monastery, and\nhe fought with fasting and with prayer.  And he built himself an abode in the desert, and\nhe worked with his hands and made good nets, and the price he received for the same he\ngave in alms to the poor, according to what his disciples have said about his work, and his\nfighting, and his miracles.  Now these disciples Abba Serapion, and Abba Khadra relate as\nfollows:  One day when we were sitting outside his abode in the desert, we heard a voice\nlike that of a man who is speaking to his friend inside the abode; and when we went inside\nwe found no one there except our father, who was alone.  And we said, “O our father, we\noutside heard someone talking with thee, but having come inside we find no one but\nthee.”  And he said unto us with very great humility and exceedingly great sweetness, “O\nmy children, I remember my sins, and I talk to myself, and remind my soul of the\npunishments which are not transient, and the pain of the death which shall find me.  Woe\nbe unto poor Matewos (Matthew) when they strip off the apparel which is on him, and set\nhim before the throne of the Living God, in the midst of the ladder of the heavenly angels,\nand all the company of the righteous, who keep purity, which they put on as if it were a\ngarment.”  With words such as these did he exhort his children and he reminded them of\nthe punishment of sinners and the reward of the righteous.   And Saint Abuna Abba\nMatewos (Matthew) made his prayers, and carried on his fight, and his service in the\nmonastery which he had built and dedicated to our father Abba Pachomius, and the\nmonastery of Dabra Bakalt.  And Satans and unclean spirits used to [try to] terrify him by\nday and by night, and he saw them face to face, and they would run in front of him and\nfollow behind him everywhere, and each one of them would change his appearance, but\nour father was not afraid of them.  And when he stretched out his hands, and made the\nsign of the Cross with them, at that very moment the devils would melt away and be\ndispersed like smoke before the wind.  One day he commanded Serapion his disciple to\ntake from the monastery to his cell a skin of water and a little bread and to wait there until\nthe following day whilst he went on a certain business into the desert.  When his disciple\ncame to the cell and opened the door to go in he saw two wild beasts that were larger than\nhyenas, and very terrifying, lying in the middle of the dwelling, and being afraid he shut\nthe door of brass.  And behold our father came walking through the desert, and when he\nsaw his disciple he laughed and he said unto him, “O Serapion, why didst thou not go into\nthe dwelling [and wait there] until I came to thee?”  And Serapion said unto him, “O my\nfather, I found inside the dwelling two [wild beasts] lying, and I was afraid of them, and I\ndid not go in.”  And the old man who was gentle and pure in deed and soul, answered and\nsaid unto him, “Believe me, O my son, for twelve years I have lived with them, and I\nmyself have served them, and this bread and water which I commanded thee to bring here\nis for them.”  And when he opened the door the two wild beasts came to him, and they\nlicked the soles of the feet of the holy man, and they treated him with the greatest\nfriendliness and were in submission to him; and the saint poured out some water for them\nfrom the skin, and they lapped it up and went out through the door and departed into the\ndesert.  And this Abba Matewos (Matthew) continued to work miracles until the report of\nhim was in every place.   And the people used to bring unto him sick folk who were\nsuffering from divers kinds of sicknesses, and he healed them by means of the great power\nof God, which was with him.  Here is the First Miracle.  One day they brought unto him a\ndumb man who was possessed of a devil, and as soon as he saw the saint, the devil cried\nout with a loud voice and cast the man upon the ground.  And the saint prayed over some\noil, and made the sign of the Holy Cross over him, in the Name of the Father, and the Son,\nand the Holy Ghost, One God; and straightway the man was delivered from this Satan,\nand his heart returned to him, and he heard the words of the saint, and he departed\nrejoicing.  And when certain of the laity came to Abba Matewos (Matthew) and offered\n\nhim a table (i.e. a meal), he sent them away in peace.  And having taken a little of that\n“blessing” into their houses, when they laid it upon those who were sick, they were healed\nimmediately, and they glorified God.  The Second Miracle.  One day they brought unto\nhim a very beautiful maiden who was possessed of the devil, and very often she rent her\ngarments, and no man could approach her, and her parents were in sore trouble about her. \nAnd Abba Matewos (Matthew) cried out and prayed over the oil of the lamp, and he\nanointed the maiden therewith in the Name of Christ, and she was healed.  Third Miracle. \nOne day they brought unto him a sinful woman who had fallen into great sin, and who\nwas very wicked, and being with child, and the day of her delivery having arrived, her\nlabor was hard, and she suffered tribulation by day and by night.  And the saint said unto\nher, “My daughter, confess thy sin unto me, and lie not before God.”  And she said unto\nhim, “I was in the habit of lying with two brothers without knowing which of them was\nwith me; and having conceived, by means of my drugs I made myself to abort the child,\nand I gave him to the dogs.”  When the saint heard this he prayed to God, and the earth\nopened her mouth and swallowed her up, and she became an example to other women. \nThis saint worked very many miracles, but if one tried to recount them he would never\ncome to an end.  One day as he was walking in the desert, a hyena tugged at his garment\nwith her teeth, and she showed him her cub, which had fallen into a hole; and when the\nsaint had drawn it out for her she crouched and licked the soles of his feet and departed. \nAnd when the time of his death drew nigh he saw a vision on the second day of the month\nof Takhshash, and it seemed that they invited him to the assembly at the feast of the Holy\nFathers, Abba Anthony, and Abba Macarius, and Abba Pachomius, and Abba Theodore,\nand Abba Moses the Black, and Saint Abba Sinoda, and they said unto him, “Good is thy\ncoming unto us to dwell with us in the Jerusalem of the heavens.”  And they brought him\nto the door of the Great Hall wherein are gardens and seats, and he heard a voice, saying,\n“Open the door so that Matewos (Matthew) may come in.”  And then he died and received\nthree crowns.  Salutation to Matewos (Matthew).\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

And a man\nwith a shining face said unto him, “Needs must; and thy son shall become a true and\nexcellent teacher of God all the days of his life.”  Now this Samuel was pure from his\nyouth up, like Samuel the Prophet, and he was always thinking in his heart about the garb\nof the monastic life.  One day he found the opportunity and went forth from his father to\ngo to the desert of Scete, and as he was journeying along the road, the angel of the Lord,\ndisguised as a monk, said unto him, “Whither goest thou?”  And Abba Samuel said unto\nhim, “I want to go to the monastery of Scete.”  And the angel who had appeared unto him\nin the form of a monk said unto him, “I am going there,” and they traveled together until\nthey arrived in the desert of Scete.  And the angel of the Lord delivered him to a certain\nelder monk whose name was Agathon, and who dwelt in a cave, and was a very righteous\nman.  And the angel of the Lord told Saint Abba Agathon about Abba Samuel, and he said\nunto him, “Receive Samuel with joy, and array him in the garb of the monastic life; for he\nshall be thy son in truth, and he shall strengthen thine old age, and thou shalt teach him all\nthe rules of the monastic life.”  And when the angel had said this to Abba Agathon, he\ndisappeared from him.  And when Abba Samuel came Abba Agathon received him with\ngreat joy, and said unto him, “Good is thy coming to me, O Samuel, thou man of God, for\nGod hath sent thee to me in mine old age.”  And forthwith he took him into the church\nwith him, and he blessed the cloak made of cloth of hair, and the girdle, and the cap, and\nthe garment of the monk, and put them on him, saying, “The God of the holy fathers,\nAbba Anthony and Abba Macarius, be with thee, my son Samuel, and be a helper unto\nthee in all thy tribulation.”  And Saint Abba Agathon taught Abba Samuel humility and\nsilence, and he was saying always, “Forgive me, O my father, show me kindness and\nguide me.”  And he bowed before Abba Agathon and said unto him, “Remember me, O\nmy holy and blessed father, so that God may make me to do His Will”; and Saint Abba\nSamuel learned from Abba Agathon all the path of spiritual monasticism, and Saint Abba\nAgathon assisted him in everything.  And Abba Samuel lived with the elder Abba Agathon\nfor three years, and he did everything, which he commanded him to do.   Then Abba\nAgathon died, and Abba Samuel continued to fast for a week at a time, and to fight a great\nfight.  And he was appointed priest in the church of Saint Abba Macarius in Scete.  After a\nfew days they brought the volume of Letters of Leo of Chalcedon to the desert, and one\nread them to him.  And when the elder monks heard this they were exceedingly sorry, and\nAbba Samuel became zealous, with a great zeal of the Holy Spirit, and he rose up among\nall the men and seized that unclean volume, and rent it in pieces, saying, “Cursed is every\none who shall change the Faith of the holy Fathers.”  And when the imperial envoy saw\nthis he was filled with fury, and was exceedingly angry, and he commanded his men to\nbeat the saint with rods of iron, and to hang him up by his arms, and to smite his face; and\nthey did all these things and smote his face even as the envoy commanded.  And whilst\nthey were smiting his face one of his eyes was torn out, and then the emperor commanded\nthem to drive him away from the monastery of Scete.  And the angel of the Lord appeared\nunto Saint Abba Samuel and commanded him to depart and to dwell in the monastery of\nKalmon; and he departed straightway and dwelt there, and he lived there a few days\nteaching all the men to be strong in the True Faith.  And Makakaz, who was governor and\nArchbishop of the city of Alexandria, and of all the land of Egypt, heard the report of him,\nand he came to Saint Abba Samuel, and he beat him very severely and drove him out of\nthe monastery, and the saint went and dwelt in the church in the desert of Kalmon.  And in\nthose days the pagan Barbarians came and took him away in order to send him to their\nown country, and he besought our Lord Jesus Christ to deliver him from them.   And\nstraightway they set him upon a camel, but that camel was unable to move at all, and then\nthey beat him very severely; and they agreed to together to leave him, and they departed\nto their country.  And Abba Samuel returned to Kalmon his monastery, and he lived there\nand devoted himself to asceticism and to the spiritual strife of the path of the monastic\n\nlife.  Then the Barbarians came a second time, and he was afraid of them, and he heard a\nvoice, saying, “Fear not, O Samuel, but go into the church and hold no converse with\nthem, and I will cause them not to see thee,” and he remained thus.   Then the pagan\nBarbarians arrived and went into the church with their swords drawn and grasped tightly\nin their hands, and they had their [other] weapons of war with them; and they cried out\nwith outcries which were exceedingly terrifying.   And the saint saw them committing\nsacrilege in the sanctuary, and he was unable to bear the sight of their audacity in the\nsanctuary, and spoke unto them, saying, “What are ye doing, O ye wicked heretics who\nhave no Lord God to redeem you, according to the evil of your deeds?”  And those pagans\nsaid unto him, “Dost thou remain here [and think] we cannot see thee?”  And they seized\nhim and tied him firmly to a pillar in the church, and they beat him very severely until he\nwas will nigh dead; and when he was about to die they released him from his bonds and\nhe fell upon his face on the ground and lay there like a dead man.   Then the pagans\ndragged him out, and brought him to the place where the camels were, and they beat him\non his head with their sandals, and they fastened him tightly on the back of a camel, but\nthe camel would not move although they beat it severely; and Saint Abba Samuel wept\nbitter tears because of his pain.  And the camel turned to him and said unto him with the\nvoice of a man who talketh, “It is well that they beat thee.  It was meet for thee to die\nbecause thou didst transgress the command of the Lord thy God Who told thee to hold thy\npeace and to speak not.”  When Saint Abba Samuel heard these words he wept bitter tears\nand said, “Verily I have sinned, but God is able to put away my transgression.”  And then\nthe Barbarians took him to their own country.  Now they had already carried away into\ncaptivity Abba John, Abbot of the desert of Scete, and Abba John and Abba Samuel met\nthere and they comforted each other.  And the master of Abba Samuel wished to force him\nto worship the sun, but he would not obey his command in any way.  Then he tied the leg\nof Abba Samuel to the leg of a maiden with Satanic intent, and sent them out into the\ndesert to attend to the camels.  Now his master thought that Saint Abba Samuel would fall\ninto sin with her, and that he would submit to everything which he told him; and Diabolus\nwas the counselor of this man.  And in all these things strength was increased in Saint\nAbba Samuel, and his heart was strong, and he remained thus until his master fell ill and\nwas nigh to die; and Abba Samuel prayed over him and healed him of his sickness.  And\nthe report of him was noised abroad in that country, and whosoever was sick came to him,\nand he prayed over him, and anointed him with oil, and the sick man was healed of his\nsickness.   When Abba Samuel’s master saw this he marveled exceedingly, and bowed\nbefore him and said unto him, “Forgive me my sin which I committed against thee”; and\nhe loved him greatly and he asked him, saying, “Tell me everything thou wishest, and I\nwill perform it for thee.”  And Abba Samuel said unto him, “I wish to go back to my own\ncountry”; and straightway the pagan made ready many gifts, and he set him on his way in\npeace, and he departed, and the pagan sent messengers to go with him until he arrived at\nhis monastery.  And his sons gathered together about him, and they increased in number\nexceedingly until they became thousands.  And our holy Lady Mary, the Virgin two-fold,\nthe God-bearer, appeared unto him, and she said unto him, “This place shall be my abode\nfor ever”; and from that day the pagans never came to the monastery of Saint Abba\nSamuel.  And this father composed many discourses, and he prophesied concerning the\ncoming of the Muslims, who are the children of Hagar, and their kingdom, and the\ntribulation which thou would inflict upon Christian folk in all countries.  When the time\nfor his departure from this fleeting world drew nigh, he gathered together his sons and he\ncommanded them to be strong in the fear of God, and to perform His behests, and to fight\nfor Him and for the True Faith until the last breath.  Then he fell sick of a slight sickness,\nand he died in peace, and inherited the kingdom of the heavens.  It is said concerning him\nthat one of his sons died, and that when Saint Abba Samuel came to him, his soul returned\nto him and he rose up, and he told Abba Samuel and all the brethren how he had seen the\npunishment of sinners, and the repose of the righteous; and that brother turned and lay\ndown, and died in peace.  Salutation to Abba Samuel of Kalmon.\nAnd on this day Saint Abba ‘Esi and his sister Thecla became martyrs.  This holy man was\non of the men of the city Bedir in the West, in the district of ‘Eshmunayn; and he had\nmany goods and possessions in abundance, and estates and flocks and herds.  He gave the\n\nhair of his flocks to the poor and needy, and he gave large alms to those who were in\nwant; he feared God exceedingly, and his goods multiplied very greatly.  His sister Thecla\nalso feared God.  The name of his father was Elias and the name of his mother was Mary. \nAnd they asked their son ‘Esi, saying, “O our son, we want to have thee married during\nour lifetime, and to rejoice in thee before our death”; but he did not wish this by any\nmeans, and he said unto them, “Pray ye for me, O my blessed father and mother. \nEverything else which ye command me to do I will undertake gladly, but this thing I\ncannot do, and do not speak to me about it.”  And they left him alone and spoke no more\nto him about marriage, for they loved him very much.  And then his father died, being\neighty years of age, and in that same year Diocletian the infidel commanded that all the\nChristians should worship idols.  And Saint Abba ‘Esi went to the city of Alexandria to\nbuy goods, and he had in that city a friend whose name was Paul, who was grievously\nsick, and Abba ‘Esi remained with him until he recovered from his sickness.  And in those\ndays the Christian peoples suffered very great tribulation, and Abba ‘Esi and Paul his\nfriend used to buy good food and provisions and take them to the saints who were in the\ncity of Alexandria, and they used likewise to visit frequently those who were shut up in\nprison in great tribulation for the sake of the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and comfort\nthem.  And these men used to minister unto them like slaves, and the saints prophesied to\nthem, saying, “Assuredly ye shall received the crown of martyrdom.”  And in those days\nthey brought Saint Victor, the son of Romanus, to the city of Alexandria.  And when Abba\n‘Esi and Thecla his sister saw the jealousy of him which existed, now he had rejected the\nroyalty of this fleeting world, Abba ‘Esi drew nigh unto the governor. And confessed our\nLord Jesus Christ.  And the governor commanded his soldiers to torture him with severe\ntortures, and to beat him many times with whips.  And they hacked off his limbs with\nhatchets, and they set lighted torches on his body, and they wound red-hot chains about\nhis body, and they lighted a huge fire in the furnace of an oven, the flames whereof rose to\na great height, and they cast Abba ‘Esi into that fire.  And he prayed, saying, “Thou didst\ndeliver the Three Children from the fiery furnace, and Daniel from the jaws of the lions, O\nmy Lord Jesus Christ, and thy martyr Victor from the flame in the furnace of the baths, O\nmy Lord, help me and deliver me, and send thine angel to deliver me from this torture, for\nThine is the glory for ever and ever Amen.”  And when he had said these words, behold\nSuri’el, the angel, came down from heaven, and he stood by the right hand of Abba ‘Esi\nthe virgin, and he said unto him, “Peace be unto thee, O righteous man, Abba ‘Esi, fear\nnot, for God is with thee, and He shall deliver thee from all thy tribulation.”   And\nstraightway the fiery furnace became like cool dew, and the angel split asunder the walls\nof the furnace, and he seized the hand of Saint Abba ‘Esi and brought him out there from,\nsafe and uninjured.  And straightway Saint Abba ‘Esi went to the governor and cried out,\nsaying, “Be ashamed, O governor, thou and thy infidel emperor, and thy filthy idols.” \nAnd when the people saw Saint Abba ‘Esi alive and uninjured they marveled exceedingly\nand cried out with one voice, saying, “We are Christians, and we believe in the God of\nAbba ‘Esi,” and the soldiers cut off their heads and they received crowns of martyrdom. \nThen the governor commanded them to take Saint Abba ‘Esi to the prison house, and they\ndid as the governor commanded.   And the angel of the Lord appeared unto his sister\nThecla, and commanded her to go to the city of Alexandria to visit her brother.  And she\nrose up in the city of Antinoe and came to the river, and searched for a boat but could not\nfind one, but a spirit boat appeared, and she embarked in it, and our holy Lady Mary, the\ntwo-fold Virgin, the God-bearer, was in that boat, and Elisabeth her kinswoman, and they\ncomforted the sister of Abba ‘Esi.  And Elisabeth said unto her, “I had an only son, and\nthey cut off his head wrongfully,” and the other said unto her, “I had an only Son, and they\ncrucified and slew Him through envy.”  Now Thecla did not know who they were, and she\ndid not think that what had appeared unto her was merely a vision.  And straightway she\narrived in Alexandria, and then she knew that what had appeared unto her was a vision. \nAnd she asked questions about her brother Abba ‘Esi, and they brought her to the prison,\nand she entered therein.  And when she saw [him] she and he rejoiced with very great joy,\nand they agreed together to become martyrs.  And when it was midnight Suri’el, the angel\nof the Lord, appeared unto Saint Abba ‘Esi, and took him on his shining wings by the\ncommand of God and carried him up into heaven, and showed him the city of God,\nJerusalem, which is in the heavens, and all the saints went forth to meet him and to salute\n\nhim.  And the angel also showed him the habitation of the righteous and the martyrs, who\nlabored for the Name of Christ, and he saw Jerusalem, the Great City, whereof the\ngreatness, and glory, and beauty, and the appearances of its spaces the tongue of man is\nunable to describe.  The decorations thereof are of gold and silver and precious stones; in\nit is a light which is brighter than the sun a million times.  And the angel of God took him\nand showed him an exceedingly great chamber wherein were three hundred pillars of\nmarble, and the decorations of the chamber were of gold, and silver, and precious stones. \nAnd in that chamber were one hundred guards, and they were decorated and girded with\ngirdles of gold, and each of them was five cubits in height, and the like of them existed\nnot in the world.  And he said unto the angel, “Who [built] this great chamber? For there is\nno man in the world who could build a chamber like unto this.”  And the angel said unto\nhim, “O my brother, Abba ‘Esi, if all the kings of the earth were to gather together, with\nall their wealth, they could not buy one of the pillars which is in this chamber”, and as I\nlooked, I marveled and I praised God.  And I said unto the angel, “O my lord, unto whom\ndoth this great, and beautiful, and glorious chamber belong?:  And the angel said unto me,\n“All this hath been given unto Victor, the son of Romanus, the general, who rejected the\nsovereignty of this fleeting world, and all its delights, and who bore the cross of his death\nand who followed his Lord.  Therefore did our Lord Jesus Christ give unto him this great\nand never-ending sovereignty instead of the sovereignty of this fleeting world.”  And I\nsaid unto him, “My lord, I wish thee to inform me what these thrones are, and what are\nthese trees with the beautiful fruit, and what are these shining crowns?”  And the angel\nanswered and said unto me, “All this place is the rest and joy which God hath prepared for\nthose who celebrate the commemoration of the holy martyrs upon the earth; hearken now\nthat I may tell thee--Whosoever shall build a church in the names of the holy martyrs, or\nshall bury their bodies, or make an offering of the fruits of his labor on the day of their\ncommemoration, or light a lamp, or feed the poor, or buy a book for their church, or write\na book of the fight and martyrdom, or do good deeds on the day of the commemoration\naccording to his ability, and even if a man cannot do these things and can only give a cup\nof cold water he shall not lose his reward, and his reward shall be in heaven, saith our\nLord in the Holy Gospel.   And when the man who hath been wont to celebrate the\ncommemoration of one of the martyrs, or one of the righteous, dieth, that martyr or that\nrighteous man shall come before our Lord Christ, and he shall say unto Him, ‘O my Lord\nand God, give me this soul, for it was wont to celebrate my commemoration when upon\nearth’; and He will give that soul unto him straightway.  And if that soul be that of a great\nsinner, a voice shall go forth from God, the Sustainer of the Universe, in the face of\nMichael, the archangel, saying, ‘God, the Sustainer of the Universe, hath commanded,\nsaying, “Let alone this soul, cast it to the martyr that he may make intercession for it, and\nlet it be given unto him as a gift from the Lord God.”’  And they shall do unto that soul as\nGod commanded, and it shall be given unto the martyr or unto the righteous man, and the\nmartyr shall take it and carry it to his abode.  And He will command that that soul shall be\nwashed and arrayed in beautiful apparel, and made to sit upon one of the thrones which ye\nsee, and crowned with an incorruptible crown; and it shall rejoice with all the saints and\nlive for ever.”  After he had told me these things, that angel of light took me upon his\nwings and brought me into the prison house, and he saluted me and went up into heaven;\nand I marveled greatly at the great gift which God giveth unto those who fight for His\nholy Name.  And in the morning the governor commanded his soldiers to bring him out of\nthe prison house, and they brought him out, and his sister was with them.  And he tortured\nthem severely on the wheel, and with burnings with fire, and with iron nails, and they\nflayed their heads; but the Lord raised them up whole and uninjured. When the\nexecutioners were weary of torturing them, the governor handed them on to the governor\nof the city of Antinoe in Upper Egypt, so that he might send them away thither.  When\nthey had sailed for a period of twenty days, the boat stopped by the river bank, and the\ngovernor commanded his men to cut off the heads of the saints Abba ‘Esi and Thecla his\nsister.  And the saints rejoiced exceedingly, and they prayed, and after they had finished\ntheir prayer the soldiers cut off their heads with a sword, and they received crowns of\nmartyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  And God commanded a certain priest whose\nname was Abba ‘Ori, from the city of Satnuf, to take their bodies, and to prepare them for\nburial with costly cloths and pure unguents, and to lay them in a pure place; and he hid\n\nthem until the end of the persecution, and until a church could be built for them.  Then\nthey laid their bodies in it, and great signs and wonders took place through them; now the\nnumber of those who were martyred with them was four hundred and seven souls. \nSalutation to Abba ‘Esi and to Thecla, and to the company of people who suffered with\nthem.\nAnd on this day also died Saint John of Damascus.  This holy man was the son of Mansur,\nand he belonged to a great and honorable family in Damascus, and he was reared in the\nknowledge and fear of God.   He studied and learned philosophy under his teacher\nKuezma, a monk and a philosopher of Karili.  When he had finished his studies Kuezma\nand Mansur, the father of John, agreed together, and he went to the monastery of Saint\nMar Saba the martyr.  When his father died he became scribe to the governor of the city,\nand he did not conceal from him his secret.  In those days rose up Constantine, the son of\nLeo, the heretic and maker of war against pictures of the Godhead, and he troubled the\nchurches.  And this Saint John, although he held no office in the Church, sent letters to all\nthe believers to strengthen them in the True Faith, and [he urged them] to bow down\nbefore holy pictures, and brought testimony from the Divine Books.  And when the heretic\nemperor heard this he gnashed his teeth upon him, and he had a scribe brought, and he\nmade him write a letter, copying the handwriting of John, and sent it to the governor of\nDamascus.  And he made accusations against John, saying, “John who was with thee hath\nsent me this letter [urging me] to go to war with thee. and to lay waste and plunder thy\ncity.”  And having heard these words the governor believed [them], and he cut off the right\nhand of Saint John wherewith he used to write.  And taking his hand Saint John went to\nthe picture (or image) of our Lady, the holy Virgin Mary, and he entreated her with many\ntears, saying, “O my Lady, hath not this thing happened unto me through contending for\nthe worship of thy picture?  Heal thou me now by thy prayer and by thy knowledge.”  And\nafter he had slept a little our holy Lady the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, appeared unto\nhim, and she made his hand to be as it had been formerly; and when he awoke he gave\nthanks to our holy Lady the Virgin Mary.  And he went to the monastery of Mar Saba, and\nbecame a monk under the abbot, and the abbot handed him over to a spiritual elder to\nteach him the rules of the monastic life. And the elder said unto him, “O my son, do\nnothing with the learning which thou hast from outside, but learn to be silent”; and\nthrough the abundance of his humility John overcame his Satanic pride.  And one day one\nof the elder monks died and he had a brother who asked John to write a funeral discourse\nand to weep for his brother.  And John said unto him, “I am afraid of the command of the\nelder my teacher.”  And the brother said unto him, “It will not be known to anyone.”  And\nwhen the brother had made many entreaties to John, he wrote a funeral discourse for him,\nwhich made very sorrowful him that heard it.  When his teacher heard of it he was wroth\nwith John, and he drove him out of his abode, and John took refuge with the other elders. \nAnd when they had pressed the elder [to forgive John] he said unto them, “Can the latrine\nof the monks be purged of his doctrine?”  When John heard this he did as he commanded,\nand that elder seeing the excellence of John received him with joy and brought him into\nhis house.  The our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, commanded the elder to\nforgive him.  And John composed many Discourses, and these Discourses [are extant] to\nthis day.  And the Archbishop of Jerusalem made John a priest against his will, and he\ncontinued to fight for the retention of sacred pictures, and for the True Faith; and he\nreviled kings and governors until [he reached] a green old age.  And when the time for his\nremoval from this world arrived, he departed to Christ Whom he loved.  Salutation to John\nof Damascus.\nAnd on this day also died Yeres Kela, and ‘Elkolonitos, and Eugenius the father of ‘Anba\nMerina (Abba Marina).\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and they departed from him sorrowing\ngreatly because of their parting from him.  And this holy man fought a great and a good\nfight, and he lived a life of strenuous devotion to God for many years with fasting, and\nprayer, and vigil.  And this was not enough for him, for he wished to become a martyr and\nto pour out his blood for the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And he went to the city of\nAntinoe where he found many Christians suffering torture, and he confessed our Lord\nJesus Christ, and they inflicted severe tortures upon him, and they scourged him, and they\nburnt his body with fire, and they chopped off his limbs, and threw him on the wheel, and\nthey made iron rods red-hot and burnt his flesh with them.  And under all these tortures\nour Lord Christ strengthened him, and raised him up whole and uninjured.  And whilst he\nwas suffering in this wise the worship of idols came to an end, for Constantine the Just\nbecame emperor, and he commanded the keepers of the prisons to set free the Christians\nwho had been shut up in the prison houses by the infidel Diocletian for the sake of\nChrist’s Name.   And our Lord Jesus Christ appeared unto Saint Abba Ba’Amin and\ncommanded him to go unto all those saints who were in prison, and to make them to know\nthat our lord Christ reckoned among the martyrs those who were called “Confessors”; and\nthe Emperor Constantine commanded [his servants] to bring seventy-two of them.  And\nthere was there with them Abba Nob, the confessor, and they went to him.  And Saint\nAbba Ba’Amin dwelt in a monastery which was outside the city of ‘Eshmunayn, and God\ngive him a great gift, and he healed the sick, and the report of him was noised abroad in\nall countries.  Now a very severe illness came upon the empress, the wife of the Emperor\nof Rome, and it happened because of a certain God-fearing deacon who was near her, and\nwho used to read to her every day the Book of the Vision of John the Evangelist, that is to\nsay, “Abukalamsis (i.e. the Apocalypse).”  And one of the emperor’s stewards was jealous\nof him and he went to the emperor and said unto him, “Know, O my lord, that John the\ndeacon lieth with our lady the empress, thy wife, and maketh the pretence of reading to\nher the Book of the Vision of John every day.”  When the emperor heard this he was very\nsorry, and he rose up straightway and went into his palace where the empress was, and he\nfound the deacon standing before the empress and reading the Book of the Vision of John. \nAnd the emperor commanded [his soldiers] to take the deacon and his book and to sink\nthem both in the river; and two men saw the form of a shining man descending, and he\ncame and snatched the deacon out of the river together with his book, and he took him and\nplaced him on an island; and when the two men saw this they marveled exceedingly, and\nthey went to their houses and told no one connected with the emperor what they had seen. \nWhen the empress saw what they had done to that deacon she was exceedingly sorry, and\nher illness increased, and the disease attacked her belly; and she continued to suffer from\nthis disease for five and twenty years.  And many physicians came to her but they were\nunable to heal her of her sickness.  And a certain learned man counseled her, saying, “If\n\nthou wert to go to the holy men who are in the land of Egypt, then thou wouldst be healed\nof thy sickness and tribulation.”   And straightway she rose up, and there were many\nsoldiers with her, and she arrived in the land of Egypt, and she went about and visited\nmany monasteries and churches, but she was not healed of her sickness.  When she came\nto the city of Antinoe the nobles who saw her marveled exceedingly concerning her\ncoming, and she told them everything about her sickness, and they counseled her to go to\nSaint Abba Ba’Amin; and she embarked in a ship for the monastery of Saint Abba\nBa’Amin.  And one told the saint, saying, “Behold, the empress hath come to thee, and\nwishes to be blessed by thee.”  And he said unto him, “What have I to do with the empress\nof the earth and her greatness?”  And the brethren besought him earnestly to go out to her,\nand he did so; and when the empress saw him she bowed low at his feet.  And Saint Abba\nBawmin prayed concerning her sickness over some oil, and he anointed her therewith, and\nshe was healed of her sickness.  And Saint Abba Ba’Amin said unto her, “Knew  thou that\nthis sickness which hath come upon thee is caused by the deacon whom the emperor\ndrowned in the river, but he is alive at this day and dwells on this island in the river, and\nthe Book of the Vision of John Abukalamsis is with him”; and when the empress heard\nthese words she marveled exceedingly, and she praised God and rejoiced with very great\njoy because the deacon was alive.  And she offered to Saint Ba’Amin much money and\nmany gifts, but he took nothing from her except money [sufficient to buy] sacred vessels\nfor the church, a paten, a chalice, and a cross of gold; then she returned to the city of\nRome praising God.  And when she met the emperor she told him all that had happened to\nher, and how Saint Abba Ba’Amin had told her that the deacon whom he had drowned\nwas alive at that time; and when the emperor heard this he marveled exceedingly and sent\nmessengers to the island, and they found the deacon alive, and the Book of the Vision of\nJohn was with him; and they returned and reported this to the emperor.  And the emperor\nsent a messenger to him a second time to entreat him to come to him; and they brought\nhim to the emperor; and when the emperor saw him he rejoiced with very great joy, and\nbowed down at his feet, and he said unto him, “Forgive me my sin which I committed\nagainst thee.”  And the saint said unto him, “May God forgive both of us our sins.”  And\nafter this that deacon was appointed Archbishop of the city of Rome, and he translated the\nVision of John Abukalamsis.   And Saint Abba Ba’Amin fought by day and by night,\nceaselessly, the spiritual fight.  And there was near him a certain holy bishop who made a\nfestival of the martyrs, with several believers, in a certain monastery; and the Arian\nheretics took to themselves a false bishop and led astray very many of the people, and the\nbishop of the city came to Saint Ba’Amin and told him of his sorrow [which was caused]\nby those heretics.  When the festival of the martyrs arrived Abba Ba’Amin prayed and\nentreated God, and prostrated himself with his people that He would make the counsel of\nthe heretics void.  Then he took a palm rod in his hand, and all the monks who were with\nhim took each his palm rod in his hand, and they went to the place where the heretics\nwere, and drove them away, and God, the Glorious and Most High, made void their\ncounsel, and they have not returned to this day.  And Saint Ba’Amin, being an aged man,\nfell sick of a mortal disease.  And he gathered together the brethren and commanded them,\nand comforted them, and told them that [the end of] his days was near, and that he was\ngoing to God, and the fathers and the brethren sorrowed because of his [approaching]\nseparation from them, and then he delivered up his soul to God his Creator.   And the\nbrethren swathed him for burial in costly cloths and they sang psalms, and hymns, and\ndirges over him, as was meet.  And his body was a help unto all those who came to it, or\nto the church, in the True Faith, and what they asked for came to them.  Salutation to Abba\nBa’Amin who lay on a red-hot iron bed.\nAnd this day also is the day of the deaths of Badlamo, and Yawaremya, and Zachariah the\nmonk.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

body of Saint Abba Severus, Archbishop of the city of\nAntioch, to Dabra Zegag, which is outside the city of Alexandria.  This holy man having\ndied in the city of Seha in the house of a certain rich man whose name was Dorotheus, a\nChristian and a lover of God, this man sent the body away in a ship under the charge of\ncertain believing and trustworthy men to Debra Zegag, which is outside the city of\nAlexandria; and he commanded them not to travel by the chief stream of the river, and not\nto land on the quayside.   And when they came to the stream Kartas, facing the north,\nhaving the body of the saint with them, they sailed a little towards the west, but they did\nnot find water enough to float their ship, and the crew labored very hard to force the ship\nalong.  And they wished greatly to tow it, but were unable to do so, and they became sad\nand sorry, and dismayed, and their courage failed them.  And God, Who loves man, and\nWho made the children of Israel to disappear before their enemies, and opened out a way\nfor them in the Red Sea and made them to pass over, this same God made the body of\nSaint Severus to disappear from the heretic Melchites who had hated him during his\nlifetime; now even after his death his words cut their hearts like a sword, and made\nmanifest His miracles.  And He made the ship to sail slowly for a distance of seven stadia,\nuntil they arrived at the place where they were to disembark.  Then they took up the body\nof the saint and brought it to Dabra Zegag and laid it in the shrine, which that rich man\nDorotheus had built for it.  And there was great joy throughout all the land of Egypt, and\nespecially in the city of Alexandria, and God worked great signs and wonders through the\nbody of the saint.  And one of the teeth of the saint fell out in his chamber during his\nlifetime, and one of the monks of Dabra Zegag took it and wrapped it up in a silk rag, and\nit healed everyone who was sick.  And the monks used to take it to the city of Alexandria\nand lay it on the sick, and they would walk.  And God magnified Saint Abba Severus after\nhis death more than during his life.  Salutation to Severus whose tooth, which fell out\nduring his life, heals those who are smitten with fever to this day.\nOn this day also died the holy father Abba Theophanius, the sixth Archbishop of the city\nof Alexandria, having sat on the throne of Mark the evangelist four years and six months;\nand after this he died by murder.  Salutation to Theophanius, and a petition for his prayers.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Nicolaus, the Archbishop, whose name\nbeing interpreted is “Conqueror of the people.”  This just and holy man was one of the\nmen of the city of Mira, and his father’s name was Epiphanius, and the name of his\nmother was Yona; these were rich, God-fearing folk of the city of Mira and they had no\nchildren.   And they continued thus in great sorrow because they had no son, and they\nprayed to God with great frequency and made supplication to Him that He would give\nthem a good son in whom they might rejoice and who would inherit their riches.  And they\nremained without a son until they grew old and their time for begetting children had\npassed, and having failed to have children they fell into despair, and knowing that they\nwere barren, and that their days had passed, and that they had become very old, they\nceased to ask for a son.  And from the day when they did this God the Most High took pity\nupon them, and gave them this holy man Nicolaus, and He made him holy, and blessed,\nand perfect, and He revealed with him the beginning of the working of righteousness. \nWhen he was born he rose up and stood among men for a space of two hours, and one\nknew by this concerning his being raised up to work righteousness.  When he sucked the\nbreast of his mother, he only sucked the right breast, and by this he showed that during all\nthe days of his life he would only drink of the fountain of the work of the right hand.  And\nhe completed the Canon of the Apostles from his youth up, for on the day of the Eve of\n\nthe Sabbath (Friday) and on the Fourth Day of the week, he never sucked his mother’s\nbreast except at the time of the ninth hour of the day.  When he was a little boy and his\nparents handed him over to the teacher he sat and learned far more from the Holy Ghost\nthan he did from his teacher.  And in a few days he learned all the doctrine and Law of the\nHoly Church, and was appointed deacon, and he added to his spiritual labors.  Then he\nbecame a monk in the monastery wherein the son of this father was the brother of the\nabbot, and this saint fought a great fight therein, and men who were born were unable to\ndo as he did.  And because he performed many righteous deeds he was made a priest when\nthe days [of his life] were nineteen years.  And God gave him great grace and the power to\nwork signs and wonders and to heal the sick.   Who is able to declare his signs and\nwonders, the which he added to everywhere daily throughout his life?  And since he hath\ndeparted (i.e. died), it is meet for us to mention a few of the things, which he did during\nhis life.  Now there was a very rich man in his native city, and after many days his riches\ncame to an end, and he became so poor that he had not the wherewithal to get his daily\nfood.   And he had four daughters who had grown old and had passed the period for\nmarriage, and besides this no man would marry them because of their poverty.  And Satan\ncaused the man to think a filthy thought, namely, that he should make a house for\nwhoremongers, and put his four daughters in it, so that they might play the whore for hire\nand he and his daughters might get their food from fornication.  And God revealed unto\nSaint Nicolaus the thought, which this man was thinking.  And Saint Nicolaus rose up by\nnight, and he took one hundred dinars in gold of his father’s money, and tied it up in a\ncloth, and before the morning dawned he threw [them] into the house of that man.  When\nthe man awoke from his sleep he found the gold, and he rejoiced therein with a great joy,\nand he gave his eldest daughter away in marriage.  And the saint threw another hundred\ndinars of god into the man’s house, and he gave his second daughter away in marriage. \nAnd on the third occasion when the saint threw gold into his house the man woke up, and\nwould not take the gold but went out of his house to see who it was that threw the gold to\nhim.  And having gone out he found Saint Nicolaus and he knew that it was he who had\nthrown the gold three times.  And straightway that man bowed down at his feet, and paid\nhim great homage, and he said unto him, “Thy reward will be great in the kingdom of the\nheavens, for thou hast saved me from want caused by poverty, and from falling into sin;\nfor I have thought that I shall be able to get may third and fourth daughters married.”  And\nthen Saint Nicolaus drove out the Satans, which were many, from the man, and from the\ntrees wherein they dwell and lead men astray.  And this saint healed many sick people, and\nhe pronounced a blessing over a little bread, and satisfied very many people therewith. \nAnd they took what was left of that bread, and they found that it was far more than it was\noriginally.  Before he was made a bishop he saw a vision wherein he himself seemed to be\nseated on a great throne, having with him the vestments of the honorable priesthood, and a\nshining man said unto him, “Put on these vestments and sit upon this throne.”  And on\nanother night he saw our Lady Mary giving unto him the vestments of the priesthood, and\nour Lord Jesus Christ gave him the Gospel.  When the Bishop of the city of Mira died, the\nangel of the Lord appeared unto the Archbishop of the city of Rome, and spoke to him\nabout Saint Nicolaus, and told him his name, and described what manner of man his was. \nWhen the archbishop woke up he told the bishops what he had seen, and they all believed\nthat vision, and knew that it was from the Lord Jesus Christ.  And he took Saint Nicolaus\nand made him Bishop of the city of Mira.  After a few days Diocletian the infidel and\nidolater began to reign, and he arrested many believing men.  When he heard the report of\nthis saint, he seized him and tortured him severely for many years; and our Lord Christ\nstrengthen him, and enable him to endure, and He protected him against the torture, and\nraised him up sound and unharmed. When Diocletian was tired of torturing him he cast\nhim into the prison house, and God gave him strength and protected him so that he might\nbecome a mighty branch of the tree of the Faith.  And he remained in prison until God\ndestroyed Diocletian and made Constantine the Just to reign.  And Constantine brought\nout all the confessors from the prison houses, and with them was Saint Nicolaus, and he\nreturned to his country in peace.   And he continued to teach the True Faith to all the\npeople, and he urged them to be strong, until the assembling of the General Council of the\nThree Hundred and Eighteen Bishops in the city of Nicea; and this father was one of\nthem, and he rebuked Arius and cast him out.  And having finished his fight and guarded\n\nhis flock Saint Nicolaus departed to God, having sat on his Episcopal throne for more than\nforty years; and all the days of his life were eighty years.  Salutation to Saint Nicolaus.\nAnd on this day Talases and ‘Al’Azar (Lazarus) became martyrs.  This Talases was a man\nof Babylon, of the province of Nineveh.  And Sapor, the King of Persia, said unto him,\n“Worship fire and sacrifice to idols.”  And Talases said, “I worship the Lord my God, and\nto Him I offer up sacrifice.”   And Sapor commanded his soldiers to bring all the\ninstruments of torture in order to frighten Talases, and when he was not afraid of his terror\nSapor commanded them to beat him with one hundred strips, and for a long time, and he\nsaid unto him, “Offer sacrifice, Taslas, so that thou mayest have rest from the torture”; and\nTaslas said unto him, “I do not know (i.e. feel) thy torturing, for my God delivers me\n[from it].”  And Sapor commanded them to beat him with another hundred stripes, and\nthey fixed bandages over his eyes and they beat him with seventy stripes--until he made\nno answer, and then they cut off his head with the sword.  Then they brought out ‘Al’Azar\n(Lazarus), and Sapor, King of Persia, said unto him, “Sacrifice to the gods”; and when he\nrefused to worship and to offer sacrifice to the gods, they cast him into the fire forthwith. \nThus they finished their martyrdom nobly.   Salutation to Taslas (sic) and to ‘Al’Azar\n(Lazarus).\nAnd on this day also died Saint Surset.  This holy woman was daughter of one of the\nnobles of Constantinia, and they betrothed her to the son of a nobleman.  When she heard\nthis she said unto her father, “Permit me first to go and worship in the sanctuary, the place\nof my conversion; God’s Will be done!”  And her father said unto her, “Go first to thy\nbridal bed, and when thy marriage is consummated go with him (i.e. thy husband) and\nfulfill thy vows.”  And she said unto him, “I made a covenant with God that I would pray\nin that holy place as long as I was a virgin, and if I falsify my words a punishment from\nGod will come upon me.”  When her father heard this he sent her away with guards, and\nhandmaidens to minister to her, and he gave her the sum of three hundred dinars in gold to\ngive away in alms.  When she arrived there she went round to all the holy places, and\nwhen she came to the monastery of the Egyptians she found an elder monk dressed in\nsackcloth, and she told him everything, which was in her heart; and he said unto her,\n“God’s Will be done!”  And when her attendants were ready to go, she went into a secret\nplace and wrote a letter to her father, saying, “I have offered myself to God.  Seek me not\nfor thou wilt not find me.”  And she tied up the letter with her clothes, and placed it with\nher baggage, and she made her attendants think that she was going with them.  And whilst\nthey were going on in front bearing her baggage, she said to a slave, “I wish to pray in the\nshrine of Golgotha before our departure.”  And he said unto her, “[The others] have gone\non before us, how canst thou travel alone?”  And she said unto him, “What hath it to do\nwith thee?  I will go by myself and come back.”  Then she took her handmaid and went\ninto the shrine of Golgotha, and she said unto her slave, “Wait here for me a little”; and\nthen she went away by herself.  And she came to that elder monk, and when he saw her he\nrejoiced, and she cast herself down at his feet, and she gave him the three hundred dinars\nfor the poor, and she asked him to make her a nun.  Then he rose up and prayed, and he\narrayed her in the garb of the nun, that is to say sackcloth, and he prayed over her, and he\nhelped her to follow the way of God.  And she entered [her] cell when she was eighteen\nyears of age, and she dwelt therein for seven and twenty years, without seeing the face of\na man.  Now it happened that there was a certain monk, whose name was Silas, who was a\nfighter, from the country of Caesarea, who had a friend who was a pilgrim and a man of\nthe desert, and he lived in the caves of Kalmon.  And at each festival Silas used to visit\nhim, taking a little food [with him], and he was blessed by him.  And when Easter came\nSilas took a few loaves of bread, and went to seek his friend according to his custom, and\nhe could not find him.  And when he was tired of searching for him, and was wandering\nabout over the mountains and hills, he found the footprint of a man, and he followed the\nfootprints and found a small cave, and he said, “Bless me, O saint!”  And there was none\nwho answered.  And he went inside the cave and found a monk fasting, and each bowed to\nthe other and asked for his prayer.  And the monk of the cave said unto him, “It is meet\nthat thou shouldst pray for me, for thou art a priest.”   When Silas heard this he was\nastonished [and he wondered] how the man knew his secret.  And he meditated in his\n\nheart, saying, “Is it a woman or a eunuch?”  Then she revealed unto him all her story, and\nhe brought her food, but she would not eat, and she died, and he buried her in her cell. \nSalutation to the lady Surset.\nAnd on this day also died Abba Tewashi.  This holy man was a eunuch from his youth,\nand he became a monk in a certain monastery and he fought the spiritual fight therein for\nmany days.  One day as he was going to Alexandria he found a woman weeping, and\nwhen he asked her [why she was weeping] she said unto him, “I am a Jewess and I wish to\nbecome a Christian.”  And he took her with him, wishing to do good to himself, and not to\nreceive punishment from God, and he baptized her with Christian baptism.  And he began\nto go about with her in the bazaars and received alms, and the men of Alexandria were\nscandalized, for they thought that she was his wife.  And they seized him and brought him\nbefore Abba John, the merciful, and they said unto him, “Behold here is a man who is\ndisgracing the monks.  Order [thy servants] to beat them and to separate them, and let the\nmonk be put in fetters.”  And Abba John dreamed a dream, and he saw in his dream that\nmonk who was showing him his lacerated back, and the monk said unto him, “Why dost\nthou lacerate my back without any offence on my part?”   When Abba John awoke he\ncommanded them to bring the monk to him, [and they did so], and he commanded them to\nstrip off his tunic so that they might see his back, and by the Will of God his raiment\ndropped down and he found that he was a eunuch.  And Abba John wept and removed\nfrom their offices those men who had brought him and beaten him, and he prohibited them\nthe Eucharist for three years.  And he wished to give the eunuch one hundred dinars, but\nhe would not accept them from him; and Abba Tewashi departed to his monastery and\ndied fighting strenuously as it were to-day.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated the deaths of Milases and Tawfya.\nSalutation to Paul who lived in the desert and despised earthly riches.   [This and the\npreceding paragraph are wanting in the Bodleian MS.]\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

And the angel of the Lord God\nappeared in a vision of the night to Saint Abba Bakimos, and commanded him to return to\nhis city.  And he rose up and departed and came to the outskirts of his city, and he built\nhimself a small cell there, and he dwelt therein alone; and he was a refuge and a harbor\nunto everyone who came to him, and the good hope of all men.  And they dwelt there and\nwere comforted by him and his doctrine, and they emulated his service, and his\nrighteousness, and his spiritual fightings.  And one day the angel of the Lord lifted him up\nand brought him to the land of the Euphrates (?), for the people had transgressed and had\ngone out of the way of righteousness, and he converted them all to the True Faith, and\nreturned to his cell.  And one day as he was going through the city carrying some baskets\nto sell in order to obtain food, the weariness of the road overcame him, and he set down\nthe baskets and sat down himself to rest a little; and the power of the Lord lifted up him\nand his baskets and carried them where he wished to be.  And at that time Abba Sinoda\nsaw an exceedingly high pillar made of pearl-stone, and he was astonished, and said,\n“What is this great pillar?”  And the angle of the Lord appeared unto Abba Sinoda and\nsaid unto him, “This is Abba Bakimos.”   And straightway Abba Sinoda rose up, and\nwalked on his feet until he came to the city of Abba Bakimos--now up to that time he had\nnever seen him--and when the two men met they embraced each other.   And Abba\nBakimos wished to cook a little [food] for the morning, and he said to Abba Sinoda, “Take\nthis pot and go, and draw water, and fill it, and bring it to me.”  And straightway Abba\nSinoda rose up, and lifted the pot upon his shoulder, and he drew water, and filled it, and\nbrought it to him, and he found the food boiling and cooked.  Then he knew that the man\nwas Abba Bakimos, and he saluted him a second time, and embraced him, and then he\ntold Abba Bakimos that he had seen a vision concerning him; and he abode with him for a\nfew days.  One day when the two of them were walking together, they found the head of a\ndead man, and Abba Sinoda tapped it with his staff, saying, “Rise up, O dead man, that\nthou mayest tell me and make me to know what thou hast seen.”  And God commanded\nthe soul of the dead man, and the soul returned to the skull, and became a body, and the\nman rose up from the dead.   And the dead man did homage to them and told them\n\neverything about Sheol, and about those who are punished therein, each in their degree,\nand he told them about himself and that he was a pagan.  And he said unto them, “Below\nwith us there are some men who were Christians and who believed in the Name of Christ,\nbut who did not perform His commandments, and who walked in the ways of the Gentiles,\nand who dwelt in the uncleanness of the pagans.”  And the saint said unto him, “Lie down\nnow and sleep”; and the dead man turned and lay down as he was at first.  Then Abba\nSinoda embraced the blessed Abba Bakimos, and they returned to his mountain.   And\nwhen the time of the departure of Saint Abba Bakimos drew nigh, and he was about to\nleave this world, he called his ministrant who was with him, and informed him about the\ntime of his death; and he commanded him to bury his body in the place wherein he then\nwas.  And he became a little sick with the sickness of fever, and he saw the companies of\nthe saints coming to him, and straightway he delivered up his soul into the hand of God;\nand the angels took it, and they sang as they went before it until they brought it to the\nJerusalem, which is in the heavens.  And all the days of the life of Abba Bakimos were\nseventy years; twelve years he lived in the world, and eight and fifty years he passed in\nthe strenuous spiritual fight of the ascetic life.  Salutation to Bakimos.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated Saint Bartholomew the bishop, and Batlan the\nmartyr.  Salutation to our father Bartholomew.\nSalutation to thy birth, O Theodore of the joyful face, who was like a good fruit springing\nfrom a good tree.

and after this the Three Children praised\nGod, saying, “Let every servant of God praise God.”  And he prophesied seven and thirty\ntimes that Christ should live upon the earth three and thirty years, and for this reason our\nFathers the Apostles ordained that people should celebrate the festival of Michael the\nArchangel.  Salutation to Michael.\nAnd on this day also died Abba Samuel of Waldebba.  Then name of the father of this holy\nman was Stephen, and the name of his mother was ‘Ammata Maryam; they were people\nof good family and they took this holy man to the country of ‘Aksum, and when he grew\nup they taught him the Books of the Church.  Then when his father and mother died he\nwent to Dabra Bankol, to Abba Madhanina Egzi’e, and he put on the garb of the monastic\nlife, and he dwelt there and fought the fight with fasting and with prayer.  He ate nothing\nexcept withered and decayed herbs, and his drink was water, and he became the servant of\nthe monks, in the grinding of corn, and the drawing of water.  And as he found it irksome\nwhen his kinfolk came to visit him, he departed to another place.  And he devoted himself\nto fasting, and to standing up, and to prostrating himself so strenuously that at length he\ncrushed his feet (i.e. became flat-footed).  Thence he departed to the desert, and he ate no\nfood whatsoever for forty days and forty nights.  And the lions, and the leopards, and all\nkinds of terrifying wild beasts came to him, and bowed down before him, and licked the\ndust at his feet.  One day as he was going along the road he arrived at a valley (or river),\nwhich was full of water.  Now he had with him a book and some fire, and making a prayer\nhe entered the water, and although it engulfed him and the current dragged him down, yet\nby the power of God having forced himself across to the opposite bank, he found that the\nfire was not extinguished, and the book uninjured.   And Satan used to try him with\nphantoms of every kind of wild beast, but he was not frightened because his mind was\nbound up with confidence in his God.  And as Abba Samuel was praying our Lord Jesus\nChrist came to him, and sealed his whole body and each limb thereof with His spittle, and\nhe became filled with power.  And from that day he bound his feet with fetters, and wore\nsackcloth.  And he thrust all his limbs into water, and he recited the Psalms of David five\ntimes [each day], and he scourged his back with strips innumerable.  And the lions used to\npeer into his cave like sheep, and of some he used to stroke their bodies, and of others he\nused to dress their wounds, and pluck out the thorns from [their paws].  And then many\ndisciples attached themselves to him, and of these the first was Abba Zarufael.  One day\nAbba Samuel met Abba Gabra Maskal, of Dabra Laggaso, (now they had never seen each\nother before,) and they passed the day in describing the great works of God.  And at the\ntime for supper, when they were making their prayers, a table came down to them from\nheaven, and they ate and gave thanks to God.  Then one day he met a certain monk from\nthe desert, and when they began to talk about the Mysteries which God had made for\nthem, Abuna Samuel said, “Behold, for twelve years I have been standing in the heights\nand censing the throne of God with the Four and Twenty Priests of Heaven.”  And when\n\nhe went in and was consecrating the Offering, there came down to him bread and a chalice\nfrom heaven; and when he was reading the Praises of our Lady Maryam, he was lifted up\noff the ground to the height of a cubit, and our Holy Lady, the Virgin Maryam, came and\ngave him a precious stone which shot out light from it, and some pure incense.  And when\nthe time of his departure drew nigh Michael the Archangel came unto him, and he caught\nhim up on his wings and showed him all the delights of the heavenly Jerusalem.  And he\nbrought him before the throne of God, and Abba Samuel received from him the promise\nconcerning the man who should invoke his name or celebrate his commemoration.  And\nwhen he returned to his bed he told his disciples everything, which he had seen, and then\nhe died in peace.  Salutation to Abba Samuel.\nSalutation to the gathering together in one place of the Sixty Bishops who were against\nBenates (or Betnas).\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Abba Khadre (Hydra) of Dabra ‘Aswan, and\nSaint John the Confessor.  Salutation to Khadre.\nAnd on this day also took place the assembling of the General Council of the Holy\nBishops, and priests, and deacons in the city of Rome in the first year of the reign of\nDecius, the infidel, when Cornelius held the office of Archbishop of the city of Rome, and\nDionysius was Archbishop of Alexandria, and Bandeyos (Flavianus) was Archbishop of\nAntioch, and Germanus was Archbishop of Jerusalem.  And this Council was assembled\nbecause of Benates (or Betnas, Novatus), a priest of Sehet (Scete) who said, “He Who\ndenies Christ in the time of persecution shall not be accepted when he repents; and he who\nhath fallen into fornication shall not be accepted when he repents.”   And Cornelius\nrebuked him for this, once, and a second time, and a third time, but he would not accept\nthe rebuke.  And there gathered together against him sixty bishops, and eighteen learned\npriests, and scribes, and forty learned deacons of the city of Rome, and they disputed with\nBenates (Novatus?) concerning this matter.  And the pretext which he put forward for his\nviews were the words of Paul the Apostle in his Epistle to the Hebrews (vi, 4-6), “If they\nhave received the light, and have tasted heavenly grace, and have received the grace of the\nHoly Spirit, and if they have fallen into sin they cannot be renewed by repentance a\nsecond time.”  And the Fathers replied to him, and explained the matter to him, saying,\n“Paul the Apostle doth not say this concerning the man who repented, but concerning the\nman who is baptized with Christian baptism each time he falls into sin.  And concerning\nsuch a man the apostle goes on to say, ‘Shall their head, the Son of God, be crucified a\nsecond time, and put to shame by them?’  The apostle makes known that the Cross could\nonly be [found] once, but that repentance can be found at all times.  And if a men hath\nfallen through denying Christ, or through sin, is he not to be accepted through repentance?\n--As thou sayest, was not the repentance of David accepted?  And was not the repentance\nof Peter, who denied our Lord Jesus Christ, accepted?  And did not God give him the\ngrace of the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete?  And did He not set him over His rational flock? \nAnd shall everyone who hath been baptized by his hand be not baptized again, but,\naccording to what thou sayest, perish?  This is great folly.  Our Lord Jesus Christ hath\nplaced repentance so that it may be found by everyone who hath denied the Faith, or who\nhath fallen into sin.  Depart from this unclean opinion, O Benates (Novatus?), and repent\nof it, and be not the enemy of God and of thyself, and the enemy of all mankind.”  But he\nwould not turn from his evil opinion, and he would not accept the words of the whole\nCouncil of holy Bishops; and the bishops anathematized and excommunicated all those\nwho believed in his words. \nSalutation to Anicetus and his company who finished their martyrdom by fire.\nAnd on this day also Saint Anicetus became a martyr in the days of Diocletian, the infidel\nemperor.  When this martyr Anicetus saw the tortures, which the emperor inflicted on the\nbelievers in order to terrify them, he rose up from among them with a bold heart, and\nreviled the emperor.  When the emperor heard him, he commanded his soldiers to bind\nhim with fetters, and to keep him under guard in the theatre, and to let loose a fierce lion\n\nupon him; and when the lion came up to him he stretched out his right hand, and the lion\nlicked the face and cheeks of Saint Anicetus.  When Diocletian saw this he commanded\nthem to cut off his head with the sword, but when the executioner had drawn his sword, he\ntrembled and was unable to wield it.   And they threw Anicetus on to the wheel under\nwhich was spread out a layer of red-hot coals, and they placed him under the wheel so that\nhis soul might be broken quickly; but God delivered him from these tortures uninjured. \nAnd then they threw him into a cauldron in which lead was boiling, and whilst the people\nwere looking on, the angel of the Lord came and plucked him out of the cauldron, and set\nhim before Diocletian.   And when Photinus saw this miracle, he rose up naked and\nembraced his brother Anicetus, and he cursed the tyrant, saying, “O disgraceful one, how\nwilt thou conquer my brother?”  When Diocletian heard this he commanded his soldiers to\nput collars of iron on their necks, and fetters on their feet and to carry them off to the\nprison house.  Then he commanded them to bring them out and to scrape their bodies with\niron combs until their flesh was torn into strips.  And he also commanded them to take\nthem into the theatre and stone them with stones, but the saints remained uninjured, and\nthey also beat their sides and backs with whips, and threw salt on their wounds; and they\nalso cast them into the furnace of the baths which had been heated for three days, but it\nwas to them like unto cool dew, and when they opened the bath chamber they found them\nin converse concerning the great things of God.   When the tyrant saw this he was\nexceedingly wroth, and he commanded them to heat a furnace until the flames came out of\nthe top of it, and therein they cast the righteous martyrs.  And standing up in the furnace\nthey prayed for a long time, and they made the sign of the Cross over their faces in the\nName of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, One God, and they delivered up their\nsouls into the hand of God.  And their bodies lay upon the burning coals from the second\nuntil the seventh (or sixth) hour of the day, but they were unharmed, and the hair of their\nheads was not singed.   When it was night certain believing men took the bodies and\nswathed them for burial in a manner befitting their honorable rank, and they buried them\nin a beautiful tomb, and signs and wonders appeared through them.  Salutation to Anicetus\nand Photinus.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated ‘Eusis (Ausis) the martyr, and Abba Antonius,\nand John the Confessor and teacher from Rome.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

I was\nthinking that I had another hundred years to live, and therefore I was weary.  But if it be\ntruly as thou sayest, it behooves me to fight before I die.”  And then he fought strenuously\nand increased the strictness of his ascetic life, but he died that same year and departed to\nGod; and he ended, the seventieth year of his life still fighting.  Salutation to Abracius.\nAnd on this day also Saint Hannah conceived our holy Lady the Virgin Maryam, the God-\nbearer.  Salutation O blessed Hannah to thy conception!\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Michael, the desert monk, of Dabra Kalmon. \nSalutation to Michael, the desert monk and priest.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated Abba Makari (Macarius), who fed upon\npartridges.   This father Makari (Macarius) sought from his youth to follow the Living\nGod, and he learned the Books of the Church, and he knew that this fleeting world would\ncome to an end, and that there was a reward for the just and a punishment for sinners. \nTherefore he forsook the world and became a monk in a monastery.  Thence he went forth\ninto the desert, a journey of ten days, and he came to a monastery about which there was\nnothing except roots and partridges; and water in abundance was there.  And straightway\nhe pondered and said, “If I go out into the fields after the partridges my labor and my\nprayers would be in vain, for I have, since I am alone by myself, no one to come to my\nhelp.   And as for him who saith, ‘Thou shalt not eat flesh,’ is it not the flesh of thy\nneighbor [to which he refers] in derision?  And God knows that I have nothing else to eat\nexcept these [partridges and roots].”  And from that day he began to net the partridges, and\neach day he netted one and cooked it with herbs, and thus fed himself with what God had\ngiven him, and he drank of the water there and gave thanks; and he prayed, and made\nsupplication to God, and kept vigil all the night.  And he continued to do this for many\nyears, and he never heard the voice of a man, and he never saw the face of a man, and he\nnever spoke to a man, and he neither reviled nor abused anyone; and he used to say,\n“Satan only makes his appearance with man.”   And after this a certain monk from\nConstantinople came to the place where Saint Makari (Macarius) was living, seeking [in]\nthe desert [for him].  And when he was Abba Makari (Macarius) netting the birds he could\nnot contain himself, but he made haste to slay his brother with calumny.  And the [monk\nfrom] Constantinople came to the archbishop, and he went in to tell him everything which\nhe had seen, [saying], “I went into the desert to look for the caves [of the monks], and\n\nthere I saw a monk living by himself and netting birds so that he might eat flesh, and so\ndisgrace us when the people saw what he was doing.”  When the archbishop heard these\nwords he sent away that monk with a messenger so that he might know all that had\nhappened, and find out if what the monk who had gone to him had told him was true.  And\nbefore the two men had arrived, and whilst they were still on the road, Abba Makari\n(Macarius) went to net partridges according to his wont, and he netted three birds in one\nnet.  And he thought, saying, “Hath God given me these [three] birds to try me?  Hath not\nmy belly been satisfied (or filled) up to this day?  [They must be] for others, but I have\nnever seen any man in this desert.”  Whilst he was thus thinking the two monks who had\nbeen sent by the archbishop arrived, and when he saw them, he rejoiced, saying, “I thank\nThee, O God Who hast given me food for Thy servants, Thou knowing well my poverty.” \nAnd they nodded to him as he brought the table towards them, and he said unto them,\n“Take, O my brethren, and sit down.”   And he seized his vessel and ate silently and\nwithout a word until he had finished, according to his wont, and he finished without a\nword.  And the two monks refused to eat, and they said unto him, “We do not eat flesh for\nwe are monks, and there is laid upon us the prohibition to eat flesh.”  And Abba Makari\n(Macarius) left them and did not force them, and he took the birds which he had cooked\nand blew upon them three times, and they flew up into the air and went back to their nests\nas if they had never been netted.  When the two monks saw this miracle they bowed down\nbefore him and said unto him, “Forgive us, O holy one of God; we have sinned and gone\nastray concerning thee.”  And he said unto them, “It is God Who shall forgive you your\nsins, for I am sinner”; and when they saw this they marveled and went back to their\ncountry and related all the miracles of the saint, which they had seen.  And the archbishop\nheard this, and, wondering, he went to the emperor and said unto him, “Behold, a\nrighteous monk hath been found in our days, come, let us go to him so that we may\nreceive his blessing.”  And the emperor rose up with his soldiers, and with him were the\narchbishop, and bishops, and priests, and deacons, and when he came nigh unto him, an\nangel took the saint and lifted him up to carry him to the Country of the Living; and when\nthe emperor saw him going up he said unto him, “Bless us, O saint of God, and speak one\nword unto us.”  And the saint said unto them, ”Let your tongues fast from the words of\ncalumny.  If a priest doth not learn from books, overmuch pride and boasting will not\ncome upon him; and if a monk doth not learn too much, arrogance will not come to him. \nLove ye one another, and God be with you all.”   And thus saying he ascended before\nthem.  Salutation to Makari (Macarius).\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Abranicus the martyr, and Horasafon, and\nCornelius the governor, and Warktepos (or Wartepala), and ‘Arfra (or Fefra).\nSalutation to Rufa’el, the healer-angel.  [This salutation is wanting in the Bodleian MS.]\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and his mother was a\nChristian.  And this Saint Marhamnam asked his father for permission to go out into the\ndesert and hunt wild beasts, and his father having given him permission he [made ready\nto] set out with his forty slaves, and mounted on horses, and he came to his mother [before\nhe departed] and said unto her, “I am going to hunt wild beasts”; and his mother said,\n“May the Lord God of heaven and earth bless thee.”  And as he journeyed along he came\nto Mount Maklub, and he sojourned there.  And during the night the angel of the Lord\ncalled to him and said unto him, “Marhamnam, Marhamnam, rise up and ascend this\nmountain, and thou shalt see a man whose name is Matthew, and he hall speak unto thee\nthe word of life.”  And on the following day, when he had gone up into the mountain, he\nfound Abba Matthew who was dressed in a hairy skin like a sheep; and when Marhamnam\nsaw him he was afraid.  And Saint Matthew said unto him, “Draw nigh unto me, O my\nson, for I am a man like thyself and the property of God.”  And Marhamnam said unto\nhim, “My father, is there any other god besides the gods?”  And Abba Matthew taught him\nthe whole of the Faith of God, down to the Birth of Christ, and His Death, and His\nResurrection, and the reward of the righteous and recompense of sinners.   And\nMarhamnam said unto him, “O my father, my sister is a leper from the crown of her head\nto the sole of her foot, and if thou canst heal her in the Name of thy God I will believe in\nHim.”  And Abba Matthew said unto him, “Come, get thee down and I will heal her.”  And\nSaint Marhamnam in going down from the mountain left Abba Matthew on the road, and\nwhen he came to his mother he told her everything; then he took his sister and carried her\nto Abba Matthew.  And when the saint saw them [coming] he made a long prayer to God,\nand smote the earth and made a mark in the form of the Cross-upon it whereupon a spring\nof water bubbled up, abundant as a river.  And he made the brother and sister to go down\ninto the water, and he laid his hand on their heads, and baptized them in the Name of the\nFather and the Son and the Holy Ghost, and their forty men who were with him; and he\nadministered to them the Holy Mysteries, and straightway his sister was healed of her\nleprosy.  And he admonished them and strengthened them in the Faith of our Lord Jesus\nChrist, and showed them how that He had accepted for their sakes all the pain and the\nbuffeting which should have come to them, and found them, and dismissed them in\npeace.  And when Saint Marhamnam arrived home he went to his mother, but he neither\nwent to his father, nor to the house of the gods.  When the king heard this he was wroth,\nand he commanded [his soldiers] to beat him, and Saint Marhamnam departed with his\nsister, and his soldiers, and went up into the mountain, the name of which is “Kasr” and\nsat down there.  When his father heard this he sent his chamberlain to them with glorious\napparel, and the royal crowns, and [commanded them] to say unto his son, “Take my\nkingdom.”  When Saint Marhamnam saw them he was furious with them, and he said unto\n\nthem, “I am seeking the kingdom of my Lord Jesus Christ which neither grows old nor\nperishes.”  When his father heard this he was very wroth, and he commanded his soldiers\nto slay his son’s slaves first of all so that he might frighten his son, and make him come\nback to him; and if he was not afraid, and did not come back, they were to kill him and his\nsister.  When Saint Marhamnam heard this he prayed and entreated God to give him all his\ndesire; and a voice came, saying, “I have heard thy prayer and I have given thee thy\nheart’s desire.”  And straightway the officer cut off the heads of the saints with the sword,\nand cast them into a pit.  And they brought much wood so that they might burn the bodies\nof the saints with fire, but they could not find them because God had hidden them.  And\nwhen the soldiers saw that the sun became dark, and the earth quaked, they were afraid\nand fled.  And Satan entered into the heart of Sanakrem, the King of Athor (Assyria), and\nhe cried out like the swine.  When the mother of Saint Marhamnam heard that her husband\nwas mad, she sent for Abba Matthew, and made him come, and she told him about the\nking.  And when Abba Matthew had prayed over some oil and anointed him therewith,\nSatan went out of him in the form of a pig.  And the king believed in the Faith of our Lord\nJesus Christ, and Abba Matthew baptized him, and his wife, and all the men of his royal\ncity.  And he commanded his people to build a church in the name of our holy Lady, the\nVirgin Maryam, the God-bearer, and to distribute money in alms among the poor and\nneedy, and they did as he commanded.  Then the mother of Saint Marhamnam made forty\ncoffins of costly stone, and she collected the bones of those forty soldier-martyrs, and put\neach [group of bones to its coffin].   And she also made two coffins of crystal for her\nchildren, and she put [their bodies] in them, and laid the coffins in the church, which she\nhad built.   And through their bodies innumerable signs and miracles took place. \nSalutation to Marhamnam who traversed the desert in search of the Faith of Christ. \nSalutation to the Forty Soldiers who suffered with Marhamnam, and to Sara his sister. \nSalutation to the Seventeen Thousand men of Marhamnam who fought the fight.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated the one hundred and ninety thousand martyrs\nwho were soldiers of the King of Athor (Assyria), the father of Saint Marhamnam.  And\nafter Senakrem, the King of Athor (Assyria), whom Abba Matthew baptized, there reigned\nanother king who knew not God.  And whilst he was in the country of the Chaldeans he\nheard that the King of Athor (Assyria) was dead, and that his son reigned in his stead, and\nthat his son was not able to rule the kingdom, and that he had stewards (or administrators),\nwho had lived in his father’s days, and that they ruled his kingdom, and that his mother\nruled instead of him, and that the stewards held her in subjection. Therefore he gathered\ntogether his soldiers and departed to rule over the country of Athor (Assyria).  And when\nthe men of the kingdom [of Athor (Assyria)] heard that there had come to reign over them\na king who worshipped idols, they gathered together their soldiers and went out to fight\n[them].  And the servants of the house of Senakrem, and the servants of Marhamnam who\nguarded his grave, went out by themselves to fight, and when they fought the King of the\nChaldeans conquered them and they fled before him.  And the Chaldeans captured the\ncity, and seized the young king and killed him, and his mother also.  Than all the men of\nthe kingdom submitted to him, and he reigned over them.   And after a few days he\ngathered together all the men of the country of Athor (Assyria), and he questioned them\nconcerning their Faith, and they said unto him, “We are Christians.”  And he commanded\nthem to worship idols, and all the people abandoned their Faith and worshipped idols. \nAnd the servants of Saint Marhamnam and the servants of his father came, and they said\nboldly, “We are Christians, and the servants of Christians, and guardians of the tomb of\nSaint Marhamnam, a work which hath been committed to us, and we will not deny the\nFaith which our Lord taught us.”  And the king was wroth, and he commanded his soldiers\nto slay them all with the sword, and they slew them, and they were in number one hundred\nand seventy thousand, and were called the “Companions of Marhamnam”.\nAnd on this day also died Abba Gabra Krestos, the sixty-sixth Archbishop of Alexandria. \nIn his days very many signs and wonders [took place].  And behold, he heard concerning a\ncertain church which was built in the name of our holy Lady the Virgin Maryam, in the\ncountry of ‘Andal, and that there was a withered olive tree beyond the doors thereof. And\nit was said that on the day of the festival of our holy Lady the Virgin Maryam, this tree\n\nused to put forth leaves, and bear fruit, and that when the festival was ended the tree\nreturned to its former withered state.   And because of this Abba Gabra Krestos the\narchbishop lifted up his eyes to God, and prayed to Him to explain this miracle to him. \nAnd that night the angel of the Lord caught him up and brought him to that church, and he\nsaw that withered tree, and after it had put forth leaves and borne fruit it returned to its\nformer state forthwith; and he told the people what had taken place and they doubted it. \nAnd after a few days came the governor of Andalusia, a man whose name was John, and\nthe holy father, the archbishop Abba Krestos, asked him before all the priest and people,\nsaying, “Is it true according to what I have heard, that there is a withered olive tree by the\ndoors of the church of our holy Lady, the Virgin Maryam, this tree puts forth leaves and\nbears fruit?”  And the governor listened and said unto him, “It is true, my father, for I have\nbeen there on the day of the festival of our holy Lady the Virgin Maryam, and I have seen\nits withered state with mine own eyes.  And as soon as the sun rose on the day of the\nfestival of our Lady Mary that tree burst into leaf, and blossomed, and bore fruit, and the\nolives which it produced up to midday were so many that they could not be counted.  And\nstraightway the steward of the church went out and took of the fruit, and made olive oil\nthere from, and filled the lamps of the church therewith.   And the people prayed and\nfinished the office of the Eucharist, and partook of the Holy Mysteries and departed to\ntheir districts.   And after this the steward of the church and the priests went out and\ngathered all the fruit on the tree, and afterwards the people took some of the fruit as a\n‘blessing’.   And the steward and the priests made the olives into oil, and there was\nsufficient to supply the lamps of the church and for their own consumption until the end of\nthe year.  And that same day the tree withered and its leaves dropped off.”  And when the\npeople heard this they marveled at the miracle exceedingly, and they glorified God and\ngave thanks to our holy Lady the Virgin Maryam.  And in the days of this father a certain\nman whose name was Cyril went to the country of Ethiopia, and made pretence to be a\nbishop.   And he sent much money to the King of Egypt, saying, “Command thou the\nArchbishop, Abba Gabra Krestos, to send a messenger to appoint me bishop whilst I am in\nmy country Ethiopia, and each year I will send thee much gold as a present.”  And the\nKing of Egypt summoned Abba Gabra Krestos to him, and he said unto him, “Send a man\non thy behalf to the country of Ethiopia to appoint Cyril bishop.”  And the archbishop\nanswered and said unto him, “This is undesirable, unless he cometh here.”  And the king\nsaid unto him, “Do as I have commanded thee,” and the archbishop said unto him, “Thy\nwill shall be done.”  And the archbishop went forth from the king sorrowfully, and he\ngrieved exceedingly about the matter, and he gathered together all the bishops and told\nthem what the king had said unto him; and when they heard it they were exceedingly\nsorry.   And the archbishop prayed and entreated God to deliver him from brotherhood\nwith Cyril, the Liar.  And Cyril took much money and fled from the country of Ethiopia\nand came to the country of Dahluka, and the King of Dahluka seized him and took away\nall [his money], and bound him in fetters and sent him to King of Egypt, who shut him up\nin prison for seven months and after this period cut off his head with the sword.  Thus\nCyril died an evil death, and God accepted the prayer of this father.  And Abba Gabra\nKrestos sat upon the throne of Mark the Evangelist thirty years, and he pleased God and\ndied in peace.  Salutation to Gabra Krestos.\nAnd on this day also Abba Ammonius, the Glorious, Bishop of the city of ‘Asna (‘Esna),\nbecame a martyr.  And when Arianus [the governor] came to the city of ‘Asna (‘Esna) he\nfound all the men of the city gathered together to Abba Ammonius and learning the word\nof the Faith; and straightway he killed them all.   And he seized Abba Ammonius, and\nbound him, and took him to the city of ‘Asna (‘Esna), and he pressed him strongly to offer\nincense of the gods, and to worship them.  And Ammonius said unto him, “It is written,\nThou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.  I take no pleasure in\nyour vain and silly fables, and I will not hearken to your words, and I will not look upon\nyour unclean gods, and I will not walk in your ruined temple, and I will neither touch your\nstinking incense nor your foul offerings.”  And when Arianus the governor saw that the\nmind of the saint would neither abandon [his belief] nor change, he commanded his\nsoldiers to burn him alive.  And Abba Ammonius asked the soldiers to wait a little whilst\nhe prayed.  And he stood up with his hands and feet bound, and he prayed the prayer of\n\nthe Gospel, and he blessed his city and the men thereof, and all the people who believed\non Christ.  And he prayed for Arianus the governor, and prophesied that he would become\na martyr, and he prayed also for the release of his soul; and when he had finished his\nprayer they threw him into the mouth of the fire, and he finished his good contest.  When\nthe fire was extinguished they found his pure body untouched, and they swathed it for\nburial in costly cloths, and they buried him on the west side of the city of ‘Ensna, in the\nfortress which Queen ‘Akalu-ubaters (Cleopatra), the daughter of Ptolemy, had built, and\nmighty deeds and miracles innumerable were wrought through him there.  Salutation to\nAmmonius.\nAnd on this day also died the daughter of the Emperor of Rome, whose name was Nasahit,\naccording to what James, Bishop of Wasim, saith concerning her:  “And it came to pass\none day whilst I was sitting in the church of our holy Lady, the Virgin Maryam, the God-\nbearer, that I heard a monk knocking at the door of the monastery, and I rose up to see\nwho he was.  And I saw that he had on an old cloak, and that his body was dried up; and\nhis face was muffled up and covered over.  And I said unto him, ‘Whence comest thou,\nand whither goest thou?’ And he said unto me, ‘I have come from the monastery of Abba\nMacarius and I wish to pass this night in this monastery, so that I may receive the\nOffering’; now it was one day from the Sabbath.  And I said unto him, ‘I cannot open the\ndoors to thee unless thou wilt show me thy face.’  And he said unto me, ‘Seek not the sight\nof my face, for my face is detestable like my sins, and whosoever sees my face shall see at\nthe same time all my evil works’; and because I refused to [admit] him he wanted to go\nback into the desert.  And then I thought within myself that he might be hungry, or thirsty,\nand for this reason I opened the doors to him, and I brought him into my abode; and I\nbrought him food, but he refused it, and he said unto me, ‘I will not eat before to-morrow,\nafter the Offering.’  Then he went into the church, and he stood up in a dark place, and I\nheard a sound, as it were the sound of angels, repeating the Psalms; and the brethren who\nwere there marveled.  And in the morning the monk sat down on his feet, and did not want\nto say anything.  And we drew nigh unto him that we might ask him to pray for us, and he\nsaid unto us, ‘How can I possibly pray for you seeing that I am blackened of face and [am\nladen] with many transgressions?’  And when we offered up the Offering he stood up upon\nhis feet, and began to recite the Gospel of John, and he drew back his cowl from his face,\nand it was impossible to look upon him by reason of the great light, which was upon it. \nAnd after we had received the Offering, he received, [and we thought that he must be one\nof] the children of the emperor.  And we brought him food, but he would not take it, and\nhe exhorted us to turn away from the lust for women whereby Satan leads monks astray. \nAnd there was there a certain good elder monk who was a Roman by birth, and he said\nunto me, ‘O my father James, this is a woman, and a daughter of emperors, and therefore\nshe hides her face so that we may not recognize her.’  Then I went to her to adjure her in\nthe Name of Christ not to hide her history from us, and straightway I lost her and could\nnot find her.   Five months later there arrived many men, who had been sent by the\nemperor to search for her, and they told us her history, and how she had escaped by night\nfrom Rome, and how they had been searching for her for twelve years and had not found\nher.  And then by the Will of God certain pilgrims told us that she had died on this day [of\nthe month Takhshash].”   Salutation to princess Nasahit.   Salutation to the light, which\nillumined the darkness.  Salutation to the Light, which was before the world.\nSalutation to Arianus the priest, and to ‘Arkisos, his God-fearing brother, the sons of\nGregory.  [This salutation is wanting in the Bodleian MS.]\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and God was with him. \nAnd God caused a certain old woman to bring him food every [week], and no one knew\nhow he lived.   And the emperor having slain the virgins of ‘Arsima, and herself also,\nbecause he wished to marry her, the bodies of the virgins were cast out on the hills.  And\nwhen seventy days had passed since they died, the emperor sorrowed for what he had\ndone to them, and more especially for what he had done to ‘Arsima.  Then his friends\nasked him and said unto him, “Mount thy horse and go forth into the desert and hunt the\nwild animals, and so remove sorrow from thy heart.”  And having mounted his horse, he\nwent out into the desert with all his soldiers, and at that same moment Satan mounted the\nhorse and cast the emperor from it; and the king bit his own body, and the bodies of his\nattendants.  And God changed his appearance and he became like unto the wild boar of the\ndesert, and he continued to go round about in the desert, and he bit everyone he met.  And\nthus also was it with the men of his palace, for Satan mounted upon their horses and there\nwas great dismay and outcry in the palace.  All this took place because of the [slaughter of\nthe] holy virgins and of those who were with them.  And the sister of the king saw a vision\nin the night and it seemed as if a man said unto her, “If thou dost not bring up Saint\nGregory from the pit, ye shall never have relief, and never be healed of your sickness.” \nAnd she told this to every man in the royal palace, and they were in a state of dismay\nbecause of this, and they trembled because they thought that he was already dead in the\npit.  Then they rose up straightway and went to the pit, and they let down a rope into the\npit to see if he was still alive, and they cried out to him to hang on to the rope which they\nhad thrown to him.  And he seized the rope, which they had thrown down to him, and\ngrasped it tightly with his hands, and straightway they pulled him up, and lifted him up\nout of the pit; and they washed him, and arrayed him in new apparel and they mounted\nhim on a mule, and brought him into the royal palace.  And Gregory asked them questions\nconcerning the bodies of the holy virgins, and they guided him and brought him to the\nplace where the virgins were, and he found that they had been preserved from the wild\nbeasts of the desert and fowl of the heavens.  And he commanded [the king’s servants] to\nbuild for them a beautiful tomb, which should be worthy of them, and he laid them therein\nwith great honor.  Then the people asked him to heal the king, and to drive out from him\nthe Satan of which he was possessed.  And the saint had the king brought, and he said unto\nhim, “Wilt thou turn from thy evil works?”  And the king made a sign of consent with his\nhead.  And the saint prayed over him, and he cast out the Satan from him, and his heart\n(i.e. senses) returned, and his appearance became what it had been originally; but God\nallowed some traces of the claws of the wild boar to remain in the nails of his hands and\nfeet, so that he should not become haughty again, and he was submissive and humble. \nAnd the saint also healed all the men of the royal palace, and cast out Satans from them. \nAnd then he commanded them to gather together all the men of Armenia, and he gave\nthem a Canon, and commanded them to fast every eighth day; and they did as he\ncommanded them.  And he continued to exhort them, and to teach them the way of God,\nand concerning the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And they all hearkened unto\nhim, small and great, and this is the origin of the belief of the Armenians in Christ.  And\nthey asked Saint Gregory to baptized them with Christian baptism, and he said unto them,\n“It is not seemly for me to do this, for I am not a priest.”  And they sent messengers to the\ncountry of Lunya, and they wrote letters to the Emperor Honorius, and informed him that\n\nthey had turned to God, and asked him to appoint Gregory their Archbishop; and they\nasked the Archbishop of Rome also, who was in those days Saint Lawendeyos.  And with\ntheir letters they sent many gifts for the Emperor Honorius, and Saint Gregory also was\nwith them.  And their messengers came to the emperor and to the archbishop, and they\nread their letters to the emperor and to the archbishop, and the emperor and the archbishop\nrejoiced because the men of Armenia had turned to God, and they appointed Gregory\nArchbishop in the country of Caesarea, and they sent him back with great honor to\nTiridates, and King of Armenia.   And when Saint Gregory arrived in the country of\nArmenia the people rejoiced with a very great joy because of his coming to them.  Then\nhe built them a beautiful church in the name of our Lady Mary, and corrected the Faith of\nall their churches.  And then the blessed Gregory finished his course nobly, and he died in\npeace.  Salutation to Gregory who lived in a pit for three (sic) years, and suffered torture\nthrough the cold of the night, and the heat of the day.\nAnd on this day also died Saint Luke of the pillar.   Salutation to him who fought the\nspiritual fights in iron fetters, and slew Mastema (i.e. Satan), and who fated six days in\neach week.\nAnd on this day also Yemsah became a martyr.  Salutation to Abba Yemsah.\nAnd on this day also became holy martyrs Herwag, Ananias, Kazi from the city of\nAkhmim; and Sansaradin and ‘Awganyos (Eugenius) from the city of Gawer; and on this\nday Miriam, the sister of Aaron, is commemorated.  [This paragraph is given under Day\nXVI in the Bodleian MS.]\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and of what took place Archelaus, bishop of this city is witness.  It was\nthis glorious angel who was sent by God to the holy Virgin Mary, and he was by far the\nmost glorious of all the angels, and most to be trusted to make the Annunciation to her. \nWhen he came unto the Virgin he said unto her, “Peace be unto thee!  Rejoice, O thou\nwho art full of grace!  The Lord is with thee.”  And it was Gabriel who announced the\nglad tidings of the birth of his son John to Zachariah;

he was next made a priest of the Alexandrian\nChurch, and by the Will of God he was appointed archbishop.  And having been appointed\nthis father took thought for the churches, and he built several churches, and he set in them\nplaces for the bishops and priests.  And he took many churches from the Melchites, now\nhe knew not their number, and some churches of the Jacobites, because he was held in\nhonor among them for his learning, and faith, and virtues; and he converted many of them\nto the True Faith.  In those days the Emperor Constantine died, and he was succeeded by\nanother emperor whose faith was corrupt.  And one of the evil men sent a letter, and made\nan accusation against this holy father to him, saying, “When Anastasius, Archbishop of the\nJacobites, goeth through the church, the people anathematize the emperor and his faith,\nand this father Anastasius (Antonius?) doeth nothing in the matter.”  When the emperor\nhad read the letter of this evil man, he was exceedingly angry, and he sent to the governor\nof Alexandria and commanded him to take from this holy father Anastasius the church of\nSaints Cosmas and Damianus, and all his possessions, and to give them to Eusegnius,\nArchbishop of Rome.  And this father sorrowed greatly by reason of this, but God, Who\nsearches hearts, comforted him, and destroyed Peter the heretic, Archbishop of Antioch,\nand He appointed to succeed him a righteous and learned monk whose name was Atesius. \nAnd this father sent to him an epistle concerning the True Faith, and he rejoiced at its\ncoming to him, and he gathered together the bishops and the priests and read this epistle\nbefore them, and they rejoiced therein, and they marveled at the words which were written\nthere, and at the knowledge of the writer.   And Athenasius, Archbishop of the city of\n\nAntioch, rose up, and taking with him bishops, and priests, and deacons, he came to the\ncity of Alexandria.  And this father Anastasius went out and met Abba Athanasius, now he\nhad with him bishops, and priests, and deacons and monks, and the chief of the Jews, and\nthen Abba Athanasius said, “O my beloved ones, it is meet that we should take up the harp\nof David, the prophet, and sing the words of the Psalm, ‘Compassion and truth have met\ntogether, righteousness and peace have kissed each other’.   Athanasius and Anastasius\nhave embraced each other, righteousness hath appeared in the land of Egypt, and truth\nhath sprung up out of the East.  Egypt and Syria have become one Faith, and the cities of\nAlexandria and Antioch one church, and there is one virgin to one holy man, our Lord\nChrist, the Only Son, the Word of God the Father.”  And Saint Athanasius lived with Saint\nAnastasius in the same monastery for a period of thirty days, and they taught each other,\nand discussed together, and searched out the roots of the Faith; and then Abba Athanasius\nreturned in peace to this own country.  And the country of Alexandria and the country of\nAntioch were at one in one True Faith.  And this father Anastasius taught his flock things,\nwhich were profitable for their souls from the Book of Life.  And because of the greatness\nof his wisdom, and his knowledge, he used to put at the beginning of each of his writings\nand letters each year one letter of the alphabet; thus at the beginning of all his writings and\nletters written during the first year he wrote the letter A, and at the beginning of all those\nwritten during the second year the letter B, and at the beginning of all those written during\nthe third year the letter ‘? ‘ and so on to the end of the alphabet.  [Oriental 667 says that he\nwrote 12,000 letters during the twelve years in which he held office.]  And when the fast\nof the Birth of Christ came he became a little sick, and died in peace in the thirty-first (sic)\nyear of the Holy Martyrs (A.D. 315?).  Salutation to Anastasius.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

And then the angel made a\nslit in his side with his fingers [and took out his liver] and cleaned it and restored it to its\nplace in his bowels, and he fastened it to his body and Timothy recovered and became as\nhe was before his sickness.  And the angel said unto him, “Behold thou art sound; take\ngood heed not to offend a second time lest worse befall thee.”  He lived in the desert\nfighting the fight and was a strict ascetic for forty years, and before this he lived in a\nmonastery seventeen years, and he also lived in a cave for ten years.  And during all the\nyears wherein he dwelt in the desert he went naked and had no clothing, but God, the\nMost High, made his hair long, and it covered him before and behind.  And by his strict\nasceticism, and strenuous fighting, and worship of God, grace came upon him in such an\nabundant measure that the wild beasts used to visit him, and lick the dust of his feet; and\nhe pleased God and he died in peace wearing the crown of his fight.   Salutation to\nTimothy.\nAnd on this day also died David the Just, King and Prophet, and son of Jesse.  This [saint]\nbecame king over Israel after Saul, the King, the son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin. \nAnd before he was king he followed a good course of life, and he fought the fight, and he\nperformed righteousness and judgment more than any other king of Israel.  And he was of\nthe tribe of Judah from Bethlehem, and God chose him to be king over Israel.  And God\nsent Samuel the prophet to anoint one of the sons of Jesse with the oil of sovereignty, so\nthat he might be king over Israel.  And Samuel the prophet chose the eldest son of Jesse,\nbecause he was goodly in appearance, and robust in body, but God did not choose him,\nand said unto him, “O Samuel, look not upon him that is of goodly appearance, and\n\nconsider not the height of his stature, for I am not like men who look at the external\ngoodly appearance; I try the heart and the reins, and I know the things that are secret.” \nAnd after this Samuel chose David to reign over Israel, and God was with him in all his\nwork.  And by reason of his excessive innocence of heart and gentleness he found Saul his\nenemy on several occasions, and he did no evil whatsoever to him; and he allowed him to\nescape when Saul himself was wishing to kill David.  One day Saul went forth seeking for\nDavid to kill him, and when the evening came Saul lay down and slept, and all his soldiers\nslept round about him.  And David the prophet came to Saul whilst he was asleep, and he\ncut off the fringed hem of his garment to make Saul to know in secret that he (David)\ncould have killed him, and boasted himself over him, but he did no harm to him\nwhatsoever.  And then David repented and was sorry that he had cut off the hem of Saul’s\ntunic.  And David found him a second time asleep, and he carried off his spear and the\nwater-pot by his head, but did him no harm.  And when his men said unto him, “Kill thine\nenemy Saul,” David answered and said unto them, “Far be it from me to put out my hand\nagainst the anointed one of God.”  And when a man told him the story of the killing of\nSaul his enemy, he said unto him, “Who killed him?”  And the man said unto him, “I\nkilled him.”  And David’s heart was exceedingly sad, and he rent his garments and said\nunto that men, “Is it true that thou didst kill him?”  And the man said unto him, “Yea.” \nAnd David killed that man who said, “I killed Saul.”  Now God gathered together in this\nprophet many virtues, and of them all the greatest was humility.  And though he was king\nand prophet, and righteous, and perfect, he called himself a “dead dog,” a “miserable\nwolf,” a “worm,” and a “beast,” and with all this humility he was more glorious and\nexalted than all [other] kings. And God praised him in many passages of Scripture, saying,\n“I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after My own heart, who will perform all I\nwish”; and God protected the children of Israel and Jerusalem with good protection for\nDavid’s sake, both during his lifetime and after his death.  And God honored David by the\nmouth of His prophet, and He set over the people kings from his seed, and He called\nDavid His son.  And it is said in the Book of the Psalms that he was well known to be a\nshield against Satans, and was full of every kind of good work, and of every kind of\nglorious doctrine.  And his complexion was pure red, like the pomegranate; he was of a\nmedium stature; and he was exceedingly strong and powerful, for he was in the prime of\nyouth, and God was his helper.  And [once] when he was keeping his father’s sheep there\ncame to him a wolf, and a lion also came at the same time to carry off some of his father’s\nsheep, and he killed the wolf, and snatched sway the beard of the lion (I Sam. xvii, 34,\n35).  And when Saul was fighting against the Philistines, an alien people, there went forth\nGolyad (Goliath), the giant, who was six cubits and a span in height, and his whole body\nwas covered with amour, and in his hand was a spear, the shaft of which was as thick as a\nweaver’s beam, and the spear-head was of iron and the weight thereof was six hundred\nshekels.  And the helmet upon his head and all the covering of him was of brass, and the\nweight of the iron covering which was on him was five thousand shekels.  And his legs\nhad coverings of brass on them, and he had as it were serpents between his shoulders and\na covering of brass upon his breast; and an amour bearer went before him.  And he stood\nup and cried out to the children of Israel and said unto them, “Why have ye come out to\nfight against us, and to do battle with us?  Am I not the Philistine, and are ye not Hebrews\nof Saul?  Choose out from you a man who shall come down to me.  If he is able to fight\nagainst me and to slay me we will be [your] servants; and if I am able to slay him, ye shall\nbe our servants, and shall minister unto us.”  And he spoke thus, and he continued to revile\nthe people of Israel, and to boast himself over them for a space of forty days; and no one\nfrom among the armies of Israel dared to go forth to him.  And when Saul heard his voice\nhe was dismayed and was afraid of that Philistine.  And in those days David came to visit\nhis brethren, and when he saw that Philistine, and heard his voice, he became full of\ndivine zeal forthwith, and he said unto Saul, “I will go and will slay this uncircumcised\nPhilistine.”  And Saul said unto David, “Go, and God be with thee.”  And David took in\nhis hand a sling, and he chose three stones from the brook and put them into his scrip, so\nthat he might have them in addition to those in the sling, which was in his hand; and he\nwent out against that Philistine.  And when Golyad (Goliath), the Philistine, saw David, he\nscorned him, for he was a youth, and ruddy like the pomegranate flower, and his eyes\nwere beautiful.  And this Philistine said unto David, “Am I a dog that thou shouldst come\n\nout against me with a stick and with stones?”  And David said unto him, “Yea, thou art\nworse than a dog”; and this Philistine cursed David by his gods.  And he said unto him,\n“Come to me and I will give thy flesh to the dogs, and to the birds of heaven, and to the\nbeasts of the earth.”  And David said unto him, “Thou comest out against me with sword\nand a spear, and I come against thee in the Name of the God of the armies which thou\nrevilest this day, the armies of Israel, and I will take thee and kill thee, and I will cut off\nthy head with the sword, and I will give thy carcass, and the carcasses of thy followers, to\nthe birds of the heavens and to the wild beasts of the earth, and all the earth shall know\nthat God is with Israel, and all the army of Israel shall know that it is not by a sword and a\nspear that He delivereth, but that it is God Himself Who hath slain [thee].”  And David put\nhis hand into his scrip, and took a stone from there, and he slung it, and it smote the\nPhilistine in his forehead, [and entered] his brain, and he fell down upon his face on the\nearth.   And David ran and took his sword, and slew him, and cut off his head, and\nremoved the reproach from the children of Israel.  And all the days of the life of David\nwere seventy years; he was thirty years old before he was anointed with the oil of\nsovereignty, and before he reigned over Israel, and he dwelt in his sovereignty forty\nyears.  He prophesied eleven hundred and twenty years before the Incarnation of our Lord\nChrist, and he died in peace and entered into the kingdom of heaven, and he was buried in\nthe sepulcher of his fathers.  Salutation to David, the servant of God.\nAnd on this day also died Abba Samuel, and Abba Gabriel, and Abba Simon.  This Abba\nSamuel became a monk and anchorite, and dwelt by the side of a city, the name of which\nwas Kartamen.  And there was there the funerary chest of a certain martyr whose name\nwas ‘Akrapos, and he used to invoke his blessing at the beginning and end of his prayer. \nAnd there was a certain governor whose name was Saliba, and he had a son called Simon\nwho was sick with a fatal sickness, and he sent and fetched Abba Samuel to pray over his\nson; and he prayed and raised him up after he was dead.  And that young man followed\nAbba Samuel, and became his disciple and a monk at the same time.   One day that\ndisciple went out taking with him a pot to draw water, and Satan broke it; and when he\ntold Abba Samuel he gave him a wine-skin to fill with water, and the disciple used the\nskin for fetching water for ten years, and the water did not spill over from it.  And they\ndeparted thence and went to another place where they built a little prayer house, and they\ndwelt [there].  And one [night] the angel of the Lord showed them in a dream where they\nwere to build a church, and King ‘Anestos came and built them a large church, and five\nhundred cells for monks.   And having become profitable, Abba Samuel labored\nexceedingly, and through excessive fighting in the spiritual fight, he departed to God\nWhom he loved, leaving his children in the hand of his son Simon; and the monks\nmultiplied and became twelve thousand in number.  In the days of this father there rose up\na certain heretic who did not believe in the resurrection of the dead, and Abba Simon\nprayed over a dead man, and raised him up before him; and when the heretic would not\nturn his mind away from doubt, the saint prayed to God, and brought down fire from\nheaven and consumed him.  And after this Abba Simon waxed old and died; and he died in\npeace and honor, and was buried in the sepulcher of his master, and Abba Gabriel was\nappointed abbot after him.  He was humble and meek, and wore sackcloth and iron under\nhis clothing, but he wore no sandals on his feet.  In the winter time he never entered a\nhouse, and in the summer time he fasted from Saturday to Saturday, and he ate nothing\nexcept salt and bread; and he used to work signs and miracles.  One day his disciples\nwished to bring a large stone into the monastery so that they might make yeast for the\nbread thereon, and they had no men to carry it, and when Abba Gabriel heard of it he\ncursed because there was no one left in the monastery to come and fetch the stone, and\nwhen the dead heard his voice they rose up to the number of ten thousand and thirty\nsouls.  And when Abba Gabriel saw them he said unto them, “It is not you whom I cursed,\nbut the living,” and straightway they returned to their sepulchers.  One day a certain man\ndeposited some gold with a monk, and departed on a long journey, and when he came\nback he found that the monk was dead, and that he had not told his disciple about the\ngold; and he questioned the disciple about the gold, but he knew not where his master had\nput it.  And Abba Gabriel went to the grave of the dead monk and asked him about the\nmoney, and he told him where he had put it, and the owner of the money having taken the\n\nmoney went away marveling.  And he had a friend whose name was Salib, and he died\nwithout meeting him again.  When Abba Gabriel heard of this, he went to his grave, and\nwept, and prayed and said, “In the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ rise up, and let us talk\ntogether,” and Salib rose up alive and lived for fourteen years [after].  And in the days of\nthis father a great persecution came upon the churches and the Christians through the\nRoman emperors, and a countless number of people were slain; but after a few days Islam\nreigned, and the Christians were delivered from the persecution.  And having fought the\nspiritual fight strenuously for twenty years Gabriel died in peace.  Salutation to Samuel,\nand Simon, and Gabriel.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Macarius, and Antedrius (Andreas), and Philip,\nand Eiteltas (or ‘Ay-Taltas), and Cornelius, and Mercurius.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and he had a\nbeautiful daughter whose name was Esther (Aster).  When her father died she was brought\nup in the house of Mardochaeus (Mordecai) her father’s brother.   One day Arkaskesis\n(Ahasuerus) the king made ready a great feast, and gathered together with great pomp his\ngovernors, and the chief governor Hama (Haman), the Amalekite, who was the most\nhonorable of all his officers.   And having summoned Queen Vashti to his table, she\nrefused to come, and sent back to him a message of derision; and because of this he was\nangry with her, and he remove her from her royal rank.  Then the king ordered his officers\nto choose out for him one thousand women from all the cities of his kingdom, whereof of\nthe number was one hundred and seven.  And out of the thousand they chose one hundred,\nand out of the hundred ten, and out of the ten three, and of the three Esther (Aster) was\nfound to excel them all by far in beauty and wisdom.  And the king made her the queen\nand he loved her exceedingly; and Mardochaeus (Mordecai) continued to devote himself\nto the court of the king, and he was not under the authority of Hama (Haman).  Esther\n(Aster) went in to the king in the twelfth month, in the month Hedar, in the seventh year\nof the king’s reign, and she found very great favor before him.   And Mardochaeus\n(Mordecai) having learned of a conspiracy between two of the king’s messengers who\nwished to kill the king, came in to the king and told him secretly; and when the king\nenquired into the matter, and found out their guilt, he commanded [his soldiers] to kill\nthem, and wrote down the good deed of Mardochaeus (Mordecai).  Now Hama (Haman)\nhated Mardochaeus (Mordecai) and all the people of Israel, for he was an Amalekite, and\nhe wished to destroy all the Jews, and to create a tumult in all the city.   When\nMardochaeus (Mordecai) knew what was happening, he rent his garments and put on\nsackcloth.   And Esther (Aster) called a eunuch and sent him to obtain news of\nMardochaeus (Mordecai), and to hear what had become of him.  And Esther (Aster) made\nthe man who had come to her [with news] from Mardochaeus (Mordecai), to go back, and\nshe commanded him, saying, “Go and gather together the Jews who are in Susan and tell\nthem to fast and eat not, and I and my maidens will fast.”   And one night God drove\nslumber away from the king, and he made them fetch the Book of the Prophets to read,\nand he read the praise of Mardochaeus (Mordecai).  And he commanded Hama (Haman)\nto pay honor to Mardochaeus (Mordecai).  And he commanded Hama (Haman) to make\nthe king’s sons to array him in purple, and to set him upon a horse, and to make a herald to\ngo before him and proclaim that he was the friend of the king.  And for this reason Hama\n(Haman) was jealous of Mardochaeus (Mordecai), and he prepared for him a tree whereon\nto hang him.  And after three days, having finished her prayers, Esther (Aster) put off the\ngarments of mourning, and put on glorious apparel, and came to the king, and she did\nhomage to him, and stood up facing him.  And the king said unto her, “What dost thou\nwant, O Esther (Aster)?”  And she said unto him,  “If I have found favor before the king,\nlet my petition be granted unto me, for I and my people are sold to death and\ndestruction.”  And the king said unto her, “Who hath dared to do this thing?”  And Esther\n(Aster) said unto him, “The enemy is Hama (Haman).”  And when Hama (Haman) heard\nthis he feared the king.  And when the king turned aside into the garden Hama (Haman)\nbowed down at the feet of Esther (Aster) to pay homage to her, and when the king found\nhim with her he was filled with wrath, and he said unto him, “Wouldst thou force my wife\nin my own house?”  Then he commanded his soldiers to hang Hama (Haman) upon the\n\ntree, which he had prepared for Mardochaeus (Mordecai), and thus he performed the\nprayer of Esther (Aster).  Salutation to Esther (Aster).\nSalutation to Aboli, whose head was cut off in a tank of water.  Salutation to Felhasius, the\nascetic, Basil, who was hacked in pieces, and Arius, who was sent into exile.  Salutation to\nthe righteous fathers of the city of Kadih Aswan, who enriched the poor.\nSalutation to thy birth, seeing that thy mother had long remained barren, O Takla\nHaymanot, the sun who conquereth time, with whose praise the earth is filled from one\nboundary to the other, and with whose righteousness heaven is covered.   [The above\nsalutations are wanting in the Bodleian MS.]\nAnd on this day also died Abba Pawli who disputed with Satan in the city of Samer, which\nis called Salonkeya (Thessalonica).  Now the men thereof were kinsmen of Herod, and\nthey were wicked; and they had the custom of going into the bath the men and the women\ntogether.  And Abba Pawli came to that city, now he had a young deacon with him, and he\nfound the people, both men and women, going into the baths together on the Fourth Day\nof the week.  And when Abba Pawli saw [this] he marveled exceedingly, and he said unto\none of them, “Why do ye do this abominable thing?”  And the man said unto him, “As we\nconsort with our wives on our couches even so we consort with them in the bath.”  And\nwhen the night was come, and men were asleep, Abba Pawli began to pray to God with\nanguish of heart to smite the people a severe blow.  And when he had finished his prayer\nhe saw a black man coming from the bathhouse carrying a sword, which was like fire. \nAnd Abba Pawli said unto him, “Who art thou and what dost thou seek?”  And the black\nman said unto him, “I am Satan.  God hath sent me, since thou didst ask Him for me.” \nAnd Abba Pawli said unto him, “I beseech thee to tell me all thine error”; and Satan said\nunto him, “Ask me what thou willest.”  And Abba Pawli said unto him, “How dost thou\nfind the means of entering into man against God’s Will?”  And Satan said unto him, “We\nhave no power to enter into man as long as he walketh in the path of God, nor into him\nthat invoketh the Name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, nor into those who\nreceive the Body and Blood of Christ in holiness”; and then Satan told him all his error. \nAnd when Abba Pawli looked about so that he might remove himself from Satan, there\nwas, as it were, a flash of fire; and Abba Pawli was terrified, but an angel of God appeared\nand strengthened him.  And on that day a stroke of God descended and destroyed those\nwho were in the bathhouse, and all that were left [alive] were one man and five women. \nAnd Abba Pawli said unto them, “Why do ye do this?”  And they said unto him, “Our\nfathers commanded us to go into the bath house, and to enjoy ourselves one day each\nmonth with our women.  We shut the doors, and extinguish the lamps, and lie with the\nwoman on whom our hand happeneth to fall.”  And Abba Pawli said unto them, “Doth\nanyone of you know his daughter or his sister?”  And they said unto him, “Certainly not,\none doeth like the irrational beast.”  And Abba Pawli taught them the Faith of Christ, and\nbaptized them in the Name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, and\nadministered to them the Holy Mysteries.   And he went into his cell, and finished his\nfight, and departed to his God at a good old age.  Salutation to Pawli, who made Satan to\nreveal to him the crafty and deceitful means, which he used in seducing the children of\nmen.\nAnd on this day also the holy and honorable Ignatius, Archbishop of Antioch, became a\nmartyr.  This saint was the disciple of the blessed John the evangelist, and he followed\nhim in preaching, and he went with him to many cities; and after this, John made him\nArchbishop of Antioch, and he preached the doctrine, which maketh alive therein.  And he\nconverted many to the knowledge of God, and he baptized them with Christian baptism,\nand he illumined them with knowledge, and revealed unto them the error of those who\nworship idols.  And the pagans were wroth with him, and they accused him before the\nEmperor Trajan the Caesar, a heretic, and they said unto him, “Ignatius destroyeth the\nworship of thy gods, and he teacheth the people and bringeth them into the Christian Faith\nof Christ.”  And straightway Trajan sent and had him brought into his presence, and the\nemperor said unto him, “Why hast thou done this, Ignatius?  And why hast thou destroyed\n\nthe worship of my gods, and hath brought all men to worship Christ?”  And Ignatius said\nunto him, “If thou wilt allow me, O emperor, I will bring thee also to the worship of\nChrist, the God of all men, and I will make thee His friend.”  And the emperor said unto\nhim, “Cease this talk, and offer sacrifice to the gods, and if thou dost not do so I will\ntorture thee very severely.”  And Saint Ignatius said unto him, “O emperor, do whatsoever\nthou wishest to me, for I will not worship thine unclean gods, and I am not afraid of thy\ntortures, neither by thy fire nor by thy lions, and thou canst not separate me from the love\nof Christ, the Living King.”  When the emperor heard this he was exceedingly wroth, and\nhe commanded his soldiers to torture him severely.  And they tortured him with divers\nkinds of tortures:  they put burning coals of fire upon his hands, they pinched him with\ntongs the claws of which had been made red-hot in the fire, and they burnt his sides with\nred-hot pitch and oil; and after this they sliced all his body into pieces with butchers’\nknives made of iron.   When those who were torturing him were weary of inflicting\ntortures upon him, they cast him into the prison house until they were able to do with him\nwhat they wished; and he remained in the prison house for many days.  And then they\nremembered him and brought him out and set him before the emperor, and the emperor\nsaid unto him, “O Ignatius, if thou couldst see the gods thou wouldst be pleased with their\nbeauty.”  And the saint said unto him, “If thou didst believe on Christ I could make thee to\nraise the dead, and to heal the sick.”  And the emperor said unto him, “There is no worship\nbetter than the worship of the sun.”   And the saint said unto him, “How is it good to\nworship the sun, which was created, and to forsake the Creator, Whose kingdom shall\nnever end?”   And the emperor said unto him, “What thou sayest is good, but thy\ntransgression is not good, for thou hast drawn all the people of Syria to the worship of\nChrist.”  And the saint was wroth, and he said unto the emperor, “Because I have drawn\nmen away from the worship of idols, and have brought them into the worship of Christ,\nthe Creator of the heavens and the earth, Who existed before the world, thou art wroth\nwith me, and dost command me to worship thy gods and thine unclean idols!  I will not\naccept thy words, and I will not sacrifice to Satans, but I will worship my God, Who is\nindeed God, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.”  And straightway the emperor\nwas wroth with him, and he commanded his soldiers to make two famished lions to attack\nhim so that nothing whatsoever of his body might remain.  And when Saint Ignatius saw\nthe lions drawing towards him, he cried out with a loud voice and said unto the people,\n“Hear my voice, O ye men of the city of Rome, who are gathered together here, know ye\nthat I do not suffer this torture for the sake of pride and arrogant boasting, but I suffer it\npatiently for the sake of Jesus Christ, my Lord God.  And behold, my soul desireth that\nthese lions shall chew me up like grain, for my soul desireth to depart to my Lord Jesus\nChrist.”  And when the emperor heard this he marveled, and was frightened, and said,\n“How great is the patient endurance of these Christians under these tortures!  What pagan\nis there who would have been able to endure such punishment as this for the sake of the\ngods?”  And when all the lions had come to the saint they looked at him, and they stood\nstill being frightened [of him].  Then one of them smote with his paw the head of the saint\nand clawed him, and straightway the saint delivered up his soul into the hand of Christ his\nGod, with joy, and his petition was fulfilled.  And those lions were not able to touch his\nbody, for it was laid up in the city of Rome until the second coming of our Lord Jesus\nChrist; and they took it to a grave which was outside the city, with praise and singing. \nThus he finished nobly his martyrdom for the Name of our Lord Christ, and the story of\nhis fight hath been written so that it may be profitable to him that readeth it.  And those\nwho shall remember his name, and shall celebrate a festival in his honor, in any place, he\nshall make intercession when they are suffering tribulation, for he is the enemy of the life\nof this world.  Salutation to Ignatius.\nAnd on this day also died the Holy Father Fulgosius, Archbishop of the city of Antioch. \nThis holy man married a wife and begot a daughter, and then his wife died and he\nassumed the garb of the monk; and because of his virtues, and his goodness, and his\npleasing manners, and his asceticism, and his gentleness God chose him to be Archbishop\nof the city of Antioch.  And having been appointed he tended the flock of Christ carefully\nand well, and he protected it against the Arian wolves, and the followers of Macedonius,\nand the Sabellian heretics.  He lived the life of an angel in his archiepiscopal office, and\n\nhe did not possess a change of apparel, and he had no money.  And he finished his fight\nand pleased God, and died in peace.   And Saint John of the Golden Mouth (i.e.\nChrysostom) praised him in his [Book of] Praisings and Discourses, and made manifest\ntherein his virtues and his righteousness.  Salutation to Fulgosius, the devotee of God.\nAnd on this day also died ... in one day, even as the angel told them.  [Wanting in the\nBodleian MS.]\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and they had no other son, ad they wished to rejoice in him in this\nworld.  And they married him to a certain maiden against his will, and when he entered\nthe bridal bed-chamber he stood up as one who prayed frequently, and he drew nigh to the\nmaiden and said unto her, “O my sister, thou knowest that this world is a fleeting thing,\nand all the lust thereof; wilt thou that we agree together to preserve our bodies in purity?” \nAnd she answered and said unto him, “God is my witness that I have never for a moment\nthought of desire in my heart.  I do not love marriage.  May parents forced me to marry\nthee against my will.  And now, behold, God hath fulfilled my petition.”  And they agreed\ntogether to preserve their virginity unsullied, and they lived together many days and they\nslept together, but kept their virginity undefiled.  And it came to pass that when they lay\ndown together the angel of God descended like a bird, and covered them over with his\nwings.  And because of their exceedingly great righteousness God made a vine to grow in\ntheir house, which no man had planted, and it grew and mounted up and overshadowed\ntheir heads, and their children (sic).   And it was a sign of their virginity and of their\nholiness, for this their action was above the nature of the children of men--two young\npeople sleeping together and the desire of the flesh never rising in their thoughts!  Who\ncan go into the fire without burning himself?  They would not have done this unless the\nhelp of God had protected them.  And when their parents saw that they had lived together\nfor many days, and had begotten no children, they thought that they had had no children\nbecause they were too young.  And after this John Kama said unto his wife, “O my sister, I\nwant to go to the desert of Scete and become a monk, but I will do nothing without thy\nconsent.”  And she answered and said unto him, “Do what thou wishest, and may God\ncause thee to be right, so far as I am concerned.”  When she had said this John took her\nand placed her in a house of virgin nuns, and she became abbess, and she performed signs\nand wonders and pleased God.  And when the saint went out to depart and to labor in the\ndesert of Scete, a man with a shining face appeared unto him and asked him concerning\nhis going forth.  And Saint John Kama said unto him, “If God be willing I wish to become\na monk.”  And the man with a shining face advised him and said unto him, “Go to the cell\nof Saint Abba Darudi of the monastery of Abba Macarius, and live with the elder Abba\nDarudi, who will make thee a monk and teach thee the path of the ascetic life.”  And the\nshining man walked with John Kama, and comforted him until he came to the house of\nAbba Darudi; and when he entered the house Abba Darudi received him into it, and\narrayed him in the garb of the monk, and Abba John learned from him the Monastic Rule\nand the way of righteousness until Abba Darudi died.  When Abba Darudi died the angel\nof God commanded Abba John Kama to go to the west, to the city of Saint Abba John, the\nShort, and to build a habitation for himself there.   And he departed thither, and three\nhundred brethren gathered together to him, and he arrayed them in the garb of the monk,\nand they built a church and a tower (or, fortress), and he taught them to pray and to sing\nhymns and psalms, and the Liturgy, and the Praises of our Lady Mary.  One night when\nthey were standing in prayer at the time of midnight, at the praising of our Lady Mary, the\napostolic Saint Athanasius appeared unto him, and revealed unto him spiritual mysteries;\nand from that day they have mentioned the name of Saint Athanasius at the end of the\nprayer of the Three Children.  Once our Lady Mary appeared unto John Kama, and said\nunto him, “This place shall be my house for ever.  And I will be with thy sons as I have\nbeen with thee, and my name shall be given to this monastery”; and the church was\ndedicated in the name of our Lady Mary, the God-bearer.   Now there were certain\n\nmonasteries in Upper Egypt the monks of which wished to be under the shadow of Saint\nAbba John Kama, and they sent a message to him asking him to come to them, so that he\nmight strengthen them in his Rule and Ordinances.   And Abba John called one of his\ndisciples whose name was Sinoda, and he said unto him, “Stand over the brethren until I\nreturn”; and that holy brother whose name was Sinoda stood on his feet, and he slumbered\nnot, nor lay on the ground, until Saint Abba John Kama returned from Upper Egypt; and\nhe found him standing on his feet, which had broken out in ulcers wherefrom the worms\nwere crawling.  And Abba John Kama said unto him, “O my son Sinoda, why hast thou\ndone this thing?  I commanded thee to stand over the brethren in my place, and to inspect\ntheir works and their obedience.”  And Sinoda bowed down at his feet and said unto him,\n“Forgive me, O my father, I have not done anything good.”  Then the days drew nigh\nwhen God wished to give Abba John Kama rest from the toil of this fleeting world, and\nthe saint wished to depart to his everlasting habitation, which changeth not; and he\nbecame a little sick and delivered up his soul into the hand of God.  Salutation to Abba\nJohn Kama.  Salutation to Abba Darudi.\nAnd on this day also died the Maccabees in the kingdom of the Midianites and Moabites. \nThere was a king whose name was Sirusadin who was devoted to evil, and he boasted\nhimself in the multitude of his horses, and the might of the soldiers who were under his\nauthority.  And he had many gods whom he worshipped and served, fifty of whom were in\nthe form of men and twenty in the form of women; and he used to sacrifice to them\nmorning and evening, and compel [other] men to sacrifice to them.  And there was a man\nof the tribe of Benjamin whose name was “Maccabeus,” and he had three good, strong\nsons; one of them used to choke bears, and kill them like chickens, and one of them used\nto kill a bear with a single blow.  And their names were “Abya” and “Sila” and “Pantos.”  \nAnd they possessed beauty of their hearts, for they worshipped God, and feared not death. \nAnd the king said unto them, “Ye are heretics; why do ye not offer sacrifice to my gods\nand worship them?”  And they answered him with one voice, and said unto him, “We will\nneither offer sacrifice to thy gods, now worship them, but we will worship the Lord God,\nWho is thy Creator, and Who made thee, and made thee to reign over all His work so that\nthou mightest see His people in integrity and righteousness.  When He shall say unto thee,\n‘Leave this world,’ wilt not thou have to leave it?   And will He not give thy glory to\nanother, because thou hast made thyself blind to the duties of governing, which He hath\ncommitted to thee?  For suddenly death shall come upon thee.  And at the Resurrection\nthere shall be judgment, and the deeds of men and of kings shall be enquired into.  There\nis nothing, which shall give them honor, for at the punishment and the judgment riches\nand poverty shall be alike.  The Judge is just, and the punishment is prepared, and the\nBooks shall be opened, and the deeds of men shall be made manifest, and there shall be\nnothing, which shall remain, concealed and unrevealed at the resurrection of the dead. \nEven the earth shall give back what hath been committed to its care, and what hath been\nlaid upon it, even as a woman when her time for bringing forth hath arrived cannot shut\nher womb when that which is in her belly is about to go forth.  Can any man compel the\nclouds to gather up water when their Lord hath commanded them to drop down rain?  And\nthey will shut up the souls of sinners in houses of darkness, the darkness where there is\nweeping and gnashing of teeth.  And the souls of the righteous they will take into the\nhouses of light, wherein there is pleasure and never-ending joy.  And at the resurrection of\nthe dead [souls] will be gathered from the four winds, and they shall be brought by water,\nand by the dew, and by the sun, and by the heat, and by the dust of the earth, and by the\nbreath of the winds; and God will bring from His habitation the Spirit.  And when He\nsummoneth them with one word they will all be gathered together, and the resurrection\nwill take place.  And the Living God, the Spirit of Life, will give the space of seven hands\nto one grain, according to His Will, and it shall shoot out its roots into the earth, and\nsprout and bust into leaf above ground.  See that it be not dead, and unable to live at all.” \nAnd when the king heard this he commanded [his soldiers] to cast them into a red-hot\noven, and they did as the king commanded; and these blessed and holy men entered it and\ndelivered up their souls into the hand of God, their Lord.  And the angels met them with\njoy and gladness, and they took them into the bosoms of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, in the\nGarden of Delight.  And the king also commanded the soldiers to cast their bodies into the\n\nsea, and they did so, but the sea would not swallow them, because the Spirit of God was\nwith them.  And he also commanded them to cast their bodies to the wild beasts, and they\ndid so, but neither the wild beasts nor the birds would touch them; and the eagles and\nother birds hovered over them and protected the bodies for fourteen days.   And their\nbodies sparkled like the foot (i.e. rays) of the sun, and like a tabernacle of light. \nSalutation to the five (sic) Maccabees.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Nicolaus, the governor, and his believing wife,\nand Daniel, the Less, the monk and spiritual fighter.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

For we have seen His star, and have come to worship Him’” (Matthew\nii, 1,2).  Now these wise men were of the family of Balaam, and they were diviners, and\nastrologers, and they watched the stars, and held converse with them.  And it was written\nin their books and in the books of Balaam, that Christ, the King of the Jews, was to be\nborn, for he saith, “A star shall rise from Jacob and a king from Israel” (Numbers xxiv,\n17).  And God in the operation of His wisdom made these diviners to understand, and he\nmade those who were astrologers to believe in Him.  And He showed them this star, and\nwhen they saw it they rejoiced, for its appearance was different in very many respects\nfrom that of the other stars.  Now its appearance was this:  That star had the form of a\nvirgin embracing a child in her bosom, and it traveled from left to right, and it traveled by\nday, and disappeared by night.  When the wise men traveled, the star traveled; and when\nthey stood still it stood still.  And it was visible to them in one place, and was hidden from\nthem in another.   When they came into Jerusalem it became hidden, and when it was\nhidden from them they were exceedingly sorry, and did not know what to do.  And then\nthey came into Jerusalem and asked for Him that had been born.  And the number of those\ndiviners was three thousand, and their kings were three, and each of them had one\nthousand and seventy horses.  And when Herod heard about the diviners who had come to\nJerusalem on account of the King Who had been born, he was dismayed and was afraid\nfor his kingdom, for he heard from the Jews about him, that the Messiah would be born in\nthe flesh.  And he gathered together all the chief priests, and the scribes of the people, and\nhe said unto them, “Where is the Messiah to be born?”   And they said unto him, “In\nBethlehem of Judea, for even thus is it written in the prophet:  ‘And thou Bethlehem, in\nthe land of Ephrata, thou shalt not be for ever the least important and smallest of the\nprincipalities of Judah, for in thee shall be born and go forth a king and a governor who\nshall supervise My people Israel’” (Matthew ii, 6).  Then Herod summoned unto him the\ndiviners by themselves in secret, and he enquired carefully of them the day when the star\nappeared unto them.  And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, “When ye have departed\nenquire carefully about the Child and where He is born, and when ye have found Him\ncome back to me, and tell me so that I may come and worship Him.”  Now these words\ncame from him with deceit, for when the wise men had found Him, he determined to kill\nHim.  And when the wise men heard these words from the king, they departed, and that\nstar which they had seen in the East guided them until it brought them to the cave, and it\nstood over the cave where the Child was; and when they saw Him they rejoiced with great\njoy.  And by the Will of God Joseph and Mary and the Child our Lord Jesus, went out that\nday to the cave, and at length the diviners found them, for our Lord Christ was reared only\nat Nazareth.  And it was two years after He was born when the diviners came to Him, and\n\nwhen they entered the cave they found the Child with Mary His mother, and they fell\ndown and worshipped Him, and they embraced Him, and they opened their treasures and\nbrought and gave Him the gold which was His tribute, for He was a king, and incense\nbecause He was God, and myrrh, which was a symbol of His life-giving death.  And [the\nangel] appeared unto them again and told them in a dream not to go back to Herod, but to\ndepart by another road and journey to their own country.  And they departed and became\npreachers and announcers of the appearance of God in the flesh. Concerning this day\nIsaiah the prophet prophesied, saying, “Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son,\nand she shall call his name Emmanuel which is, being interpreted, God with us” (Isaiah\nvii, 14).  And concerning this virgin the prophet Ezekiel prophesied, saying, “I saw the\ndoor of the East.  And God said unto me:  This shall be a means of exit.  None shall enter\nthrough it, and none besides the Lord God of Israel shall go out there from” (Ezekiel x,\n19).  And concerning this virgin Daniel the prophet saith, “I saw as it were the Son of\nman, and a cloud came until it reached the Ancient of Days.  And it drew nigh unto Him\nand ascribed to Him dominion, and sovereignty, and honor, and it made all the people and\nall he nations worship Him, and His dominion was an everlasting dominion, and there was\nno end to His kingdom” (Daniel vii).  And Isaiah the prophet also saith, “God appeared\nunto me from Zion, having covered Himself with a covering of flesh like unto myself, and\nHe said unto me, Behold the flesh which I will take from the seed of David, the son of\nJesse.”  And Isaiah the prophet also saith, “Behold, I will assuredly make a new heaven\nand a new earth, and I will dwell in them with those I love, and they shall rejoice for\never.”  And also, “God will make a rod from the root of Jesse to bud, and He will put\nwisdom, and knowledge, and power therein, and he shall do justice to the poor, and he\nshall smite the earth with the word of his mouth, and he shall slay the perverse with the\nspirit of his lips.”  And Isaiah the prophet also saith, “I will set my son to be a sign for the\nnations, and he shall rule over them, and they shall believe on Him and put their trust in\nHim, and He shall be for rest and glory, and the earth shall be full of the knowledge of\nGod.”  And Isaiah also saith, “For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given.  His\ndominion shall be upon His swathing, and His name shall be called, Great, Counselor,\nAlmighty God, Governor, King of Peace, Everlasting Father who shall come.”   And\nJeremiah the prophet saith, “Thus saith the Lord:  In those days great light shall rise up for\nDavid, and he shall set judgment and integrity in the earth.  And God shall deliver those\nwho believe on Him, from Judah and Israel.”  And Elisa the prophet saith, “God shall\ncome down from heaven, and shall walk about in the market-places of the children of\nIsrael, and He shall teach the people righteousness, and all nations shall be in submission\nunto Him, except the nation of the alien sons of Abraham.”  And Nehemiah prophesied,\nsaying, “God shall come in my own appearance, and His raiment shall be as is my\nraiment.”  And Joel the prophet prophesied, saying, “I see the virgin daughter of the tribe\nof Judah and of the seed of David become a seat for God, and she shall burn like fire.  And\nI asked the Cherubim concerning her, and I said unto him, ‘Who is this [virgin]?’  And he\nsaid unto me, ‘This is the virgin, the seat of God, chosen from among the sons of Adam,\nand by her He shall redeem the abominable nations, and she shall be a helper and a\nsupport of him that shall believe on her.’”  And David saith in the Psalms, “The Great God\nsaid unto me:  Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee.  Ask Me, I will give Thee\nthe nations for an inheritance, and Thy rule shall be to the ends of the earth.  Thou shalt\nrule them with a rod of iron, and like the vessel of the potter Thou shalt smash them.  And\nnow, O kings, get ye understanding, and be admonished all ye who judge the earth.  Serve\nye God with fear, and rejoice in Him with trembling; strengthen wisdom so that God may\nnot be wroth, and that ye may not perish from the way of righteousness.  Blessed be all\nthose who put their trust in Him” (Psalm 2).   And the prophet also saith in the 110th\nPsalm, “I begot Thee in the womb before the Morning Star.  God hath sworn, and He will\nnot repent.   Thou art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedek” (Psalm\n110:3&4).  As he revealed unto Abraham a ram in the thicket, and as water poured out of\nthe rock in the desert, and as the dry rod of Aaron sprouted and blossomed, and as the ass\nof Balaam spoke, and as water poured out from the jawbone of an ass into the hands of\nSamson the giant, and water and honey from the bones of a lion, and as the fire burned in\nthe bush before Moses, and the bush was not consumed, even so did our Lady, the holy\n\nVirgin Mary, bring froth our Lord Jesus Christ. And the fire of His Godhead did not\nconsume the Virgin Mary.  Salutation to Thy Birth, O Lamp of the darkness.\nAnd on this day also was born Joshua, the judge, of the house of Ephraim, who became\nthe salvation of the children of Israel against the attacks of their enemies, just as the Birth\nof our Lord became the salvation of Adam and his children.  Now formerly the name of\nJoshua was “Hose’a” but when God delivered the children of Israel from Amalek by his\nhelp, he was called “Iyasus” that is to say, “Savior” (or “Redeemer”).  After the death of\nMoses God chose him to be judge over Israel, and he delivered them from slaughter by\nalien nations, and made them to inherit their land; then he died in peace and inherited the\nkingdom of heaven.\n“The kings of Saba and Arabia shall bring gifts with entreaty, and the kings of the Islands\nand of Tarshish shall bring in presents” (Psalm 72:10).  Hath come, hath come David, the\nking, was said of old by the little virgin who brought him forth.  [Omitted in the Bodleian\nMS.]\nSalutation to Thy Birth, O consuming Fire.\nSalutation to your blood which was shed, O ye martyrs of ‘Akmim.   [Omitted in the\nBodleian MS.]\nSalutation to the blessed Kuoril, master of three camels [Kuoril the camel man, of the city\nof Samanud,] and Abba Gize.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Jacob (James) and Piles (Pilses), and Theodore,\nthe martyrs.\nAnd on this day also died ‘Akaryos (Abgar), King of Roha (Edessa).  The kingdom of this\nsaint was in the country of Syria, which is called “Saranin,” and in the city of Roha\n(Edessa), and he was a worshipper of idols, and a paralytic, and [although] he had given\n[much] money to the physicians they would not heal him.   And when he heard of the\nworks of our Lord, and the miracles which He performed, and how He healed the sick,\nand cast out devils, and opened the eyes of the blind, and raised the dead, he sent a letter\nto Him, saying, “Peace be unto Thee, O God, Who hast appeared in Jerusalem, in the flesh\nof men.   And peace be unto Thy Father Who hast sent Thee down without Thy being\nseparated from Him.  And peace be unto the Holy Spirit, Who hath whispered in my mind\nthat Thou art His Messiah, and His equal.   Peace be unto Thee, O Thou Who wast\nbegotten in virginity, without the seed of man.   And peace be unto those who have\nbelieved on Thee.  I believe on Thee, and I have turned from the worship of idols to the\nworship of Thee.  Come to me that Thou mayest be King over me, and make my city Thy\nhome (?), and heal my sickness, and cleanse my impurity.  What matter the Jews to Thee? \nThey spit upon Thy Name, and they hurt Thee; they are a nation of men of perverted\ncounsel.  If in times of old they did not believe on Thee when Thou didst bring them out\nof Egypt, by working miracles, and didst feed them with manna for forty years (?), and\nthey murmured against Thee so much that Thou didst deliver them over to destruction,\nhow much less will they believe on Thee when they see Thee clothed in the flesh of earth,\nwhich hungereth and thirsteth?  Dost Thou imagine that their evil disposition will show\nitself differently because Thou art learned in hidden things?”  And these and such like\nthings did the King of Roha (Edessa) send to Him in writing.  And when the messengers\ncame to our Lord, He knew what was in their hearts, and He told them what was in the\nletter before they spoke to Him.  And then He took a piece of white cloth and wiped His\nface thereon, and the exact form and features of His face remained impressed on that\ncloth, and He sent it with Thaddeus, His disciple, [to the King of Roha (Edessa),] saying,\n“Take this picture of My Person, and it shall fulfill for thee all thy wants, and it shall heal\nthee of thy sickness, and shall bless thy city, and direct thy kingdom rightly.  I have tested\nthis picture in fire and in water to see if it would change, [but it did not].”  And when the\nmessengers came to ‘Akaryos (Abgar) they gave him the picture, and he put it in the fire\nand in water, and neither harmed it.  And the city of Roha (Edessa) believed in it, and in\n\nits divine authority, and it worked miracles innumerable.  And the king was healed of his\nsickness and died in peace that day.  Salutation to ‘Akaryos (Abgar), to whom our Lord\nsent an indestructible portrait of Himself.\nAnd on this day also died Kuoril, the camel man.  This holy man was from the city of\nSamnud, and he devoted himself to fasting and to prayers, and God gave him the\nknowledge of mysteries, and of things that were hidden.  And he had three camels, which\nhe worked according to his needs, and he used to load them with what he required from\nthe flax fields, which he possessed.  And he had a certain man, who was one of the men of\nFaragun, and who was a chief priest of the shrine of our Lady Mary of that city, and his\nfather had held the [same] office before him; and this church possessed much money\nwhich had been given thereto by kings and governors.  And he used to have charge of the\ntreasury, which was hidden, and the bishop and he, who was under him, that is to say, this\nchief priest, knew the amount of treasure therein; and then, suddenly, without uttering a\nword to his son, he died.  When the bishop heard of his death he came to the church and\ndemanded the money from his son, who said, “I do not know where the treasury is, and\nmy father, whom the hand of death hath snatched sway suddenly, hath never told me.” \nWhen the bishop heard this he was wroth and he wished to torture him, and the man said\nto the bishop, “Wait until I have looked for the place where the treasure is, and if I do not\nfind it do with me what thou wilt”; and to this the bishop agreed, and fixed a time.  And\nthe young man went into his house and told his wife all the trouble.  And she said unto\nhim, “Put thy trust in God, and go to the monks, the fathers of Dabra Abba Makara, and\nask them and their neighbors for they will tell thee.”  And when he had arrived there he\nasked the monks with tears to make themselves masters of [his] sorrow; and not one of\nthem could tell him anything.  Then a certain solitary made a sign to him, and said unto\nhim, “Go to Samnud, and enquire for Kuoril an owner of camels, and tarry with him, and\nhe will tell thee [where it is].”   And when he had come into the city of Samnud, and\nenquired for Kuoril, the people told him [where he was]; and when he arrived there he\nfound him in his house and his three camels were with him.  As soon as Kuoril saw him,\nhe knew by the Spirit everything, and what he wanted, and then he brought him into his\ndwelling and offered him food.  And the young man said unto him, “O my father, I cannot\neat until I have finished my errand”; and Kuoril said unto him, “Thine errand shall be\nfulfilled.”  And after supper each man went to sleep in his abode.  And at midnight Kuoril\nthe camel man saw a vision of that man standing by his camels, and when he bowed the\nman bowed with him, and when he prayed the man prayed with him.  And on the morrow\nhe took his camels into the desert to load them with the flax, which he needed, and that\nman [of the dream] went with him to help him.  When they arrived in the fields Kuoril\ntook one camel to load him with flax, and that man took the second camel to load him, but\nhe put a load on the camel’s back which was beyond his capacity to carry, and overloaded\nhim very much indeed; and when the animal wanted to raise his load he was unable to\nmove.  And that man took a stick to beat him, but the camel cried out in human speech,\nsaying, “O my father Kuoril, do not let this man ill-treat me; he hath loaded me beyond\nwhat is right for me.”  And Kuoril came and lightened the weight of the camel’s load, and\nhe said unto that man, “O my son, why didst thou load him with a weight heavier than he\ncould carry?  Wouldst not thou be sorry if one laid a heavy load upon thee, and a labor\nwhich thou couldst not perform?”  And then when they came into their abode he asked\nhim about his sorrow so that he might tell him and reveal to him the place of the treasure;\nand having made him to swear that he would not repeat his words to anyone else, he said\nunto him, “There is at the east end of the church a little box, and therein is the treasure.” \nAnd when the young man went into his house, he told his wife, and they went together to\nthat place and found there a treasure the like whereof in quantity doth not exist in the\ntreasuries of kings; and he told the bishop, who took charge of it.  Salutation to the blessed\nKuoril.\nAnd on this day also the men of Akmim became martyrs.  They were gathered together in\nthe church on the festival of the Nativity, which is to be praised! And they were\nperforming the service of the consecration of the Offering, and they saw our Lord sitting\nupon the Tabot (tabernacle) administering the Holy Mysteries to the people.  And whilst\n\nthey were enjoying this happiness Arianus came and attacked them, and he entered the\nchurch and seized the two prefects of the city whose names were Behwafa and Wenin, and\ncut off their heads with the sword.  After that he slew the deacons, and the sub-deacons,\nand those who sang (i.e. the choir), and the steward of the church, and he left not alive\nneither woman nor child; and he slew so many that the blood ran out of the door of the\nchurch and along the road for a distance of twenty cubits.  And Abba Venudius, the\nbishop, and Dioscurus, and Saclabius and his brethren who were with them, Arianus took\nwith him bound in fetters.  And behold the memorial of their martyrdom is written in the\nsection for the First Day of the month of Ter.  Salutation to your blood, O ye martyrs of\nAkmim, which was shed mercilessly.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

Concerning this day\nIsaiah the prophet prophesied, saying, “Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son,\nand she shall call his name Emmanuel which is, being interpreted, God with us” (Isaiah\nvii, 14).  And concerning this virgin the prophet Ezekiel prophesied, saying, “I saw the\ndoor of the East.  And God said unto me:  This shall be a means of exit.  None shall enter\nthrough it, and none besides the Lord God of Israel shall go out there from” (Ezekiel x,\n19).  And concerning this virgin Daniel the prophet saith, “I saw as it were the Son of\nman, and a cloud came until it reached the Ancient of Days.  And it drew nigh unto Him\nand ascribed to Him dominion, and sovereignty, and honor, and it made all the people and\nall he nations worship Him, and His dominion was an everlasting dominion, and there was\nno end to His kingdom” (Daniel vii).  And Isaiah the prophet also saith, “God appeared\nunto me from Zion, having covered Himself with a covering of flesh like unto myself, and\nHe said unto me, Behold the flesh which I will take from the seed of David, the son of\nJesse.”  And Isaiah the prophet also saith, “Behold, I will assuredly make a new heaven\nand a new earth, and I will dwell in them with those I love, and they shall rejoice for\never.”  And also, “God will make a rod from the root of Jesse to bud, and He will put\nwisdom, and knowledge, and power therein, and he shall do justice to the poor, and he\nshall smite the earth with the word of his mouth, and he shall slay the perverse with the\nspirit of his lips.”  And Isaiah the prophet also saith, “I will set my son to be a sign for the\nnations, and he shall rule over them, and they shall believe on Him and put their trust in\nHim, and He shall be for rest and glory, and the earth shall be full of the knowledge of\nGod.”  And Isaiah also saith, “For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given.  His\ndominion shall be upon His swathing, and His name shall be called, Great, Counselor,\nAlmighty God, Governor, King of Peace, Everlasting Father who shall come.”   And\nJeremiah the prophet saith, “Thus saith the Lord:  In those days great light shall rise up for\nDavid, and he shall set judgment and integrity in the earth.  And God shall deliver those\nwho believe on Him, from Judah and Israel.”  And Elisa the prophet saith, “God shall\ncome down from heaven, and shall walk about in the market-places of the children of\nIsrael, and He shall teach the people righteousness, and all nations shall be in submission\nunto Him, except the nation of the alien sons of Abraham.”  And Nehemiah prophesied,\nsaying, “God shall come in my own appearance, and His raiment shall be as is my\nraiment.”  And Joel the prophet prophesied, saying, “I see the virgin daughter of the tribe\nof Judah and of the seed of David become a seat for God, and she shall burn like fire.  And\nI asked the Cherubim concerning her, and I said unto him, ‘Who is this [virgin]?’  And he\nsaid unto me, ‘This is the virgin, the seat of God, chosen from among the sons of Adam,\nand by her He shall redeem the abominable nations, and she shall be a helper and a\nsupport of him that shall believe on her.’”  And David saith in the Psalms, “The Great God\nsaid unto me:  Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee.  Ask Me, I will give Thee\nthe nations for an inheritance, and Thy rule shall be to the ends of the earth.  Thou shalt\nrule them with a rod of iron, and like the vessel of the potter Thou shalt smash them.  And\nnow, O kings, get ye understanding, and be admonished all ye who judge the earth.  Serve\nye God with fear, and rejoice in Him with trembling; strengthen wisdom so that God may\nnot be wroth, and that ye may not perish from the way of righteousness.  Blessed be all\nthose who put their trust in Him” (Psalm 2).   And the prophet also saith in the 110th\nPsalm, “I begot Thee in the womb before the Morning Star.  God hath sworn, and He will\nnot repent.   Thou art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedek” (Psalm\n110:3&4).  As he revealed unto Abraham a ram in the thicket, and as water poured out of\nthe rock in the desert, and as the dry rod of Aaron sprouted and blossomed, and as the ass\nof Balaam spoke, and as water poured out from the jawbone of an ass into the hands of\nSamson the giant, and water and honey from the bones of a lion, and as the fire burned in\nthe bush before Moses, and the bush was not consumed, even so did our Lady, the holy\n\nVirgin Mary, bring froth our Lord Jesus Christ. And the fire of His Godhead did not\nconsume the Virgin Mary.  Salutation to Thy Birth, O Lamp of the darkness.\nAnd on this day also was born Joshua, the judge, of the house of Ephraim, who became\nthe salvation of the children of Israel against the attacks of their enemies, just as the Birth\nof our Lord became the salvation of Adam and his children.  Now formerly the name of\nJoshua was “Hose’a” but when God delivered the children of Israel from Amalek by his\nhelp, he was called “Iyasus” that is to say, “Savior” (or “Redeemer”).  After the death of\nMoses God chose him to be judge over Israel, and he delivered them from slaughter by\nalien nations, and made them to inherit their land; then he died in peace and inherited the\nkingdom of heaven.\n“The kings of Saba and Arabia shall bring gifts with entreaty, and the kings of the Islands\nand of Tarshish shall bring in presents” (Psalm 72:10).  Hath come, hath come David, the\nking, was said of old by the little virgin who brought him forth.  [Omitted in the Bodleian\nMS.]\nSalutation to Thy Birth, O consuming Fire.\nSalutation to your blood which was shed, O ye martyrs of ‘Akmim.   [Omitted in the\nBodleian MS.]\nSalutation to the blessed Kuoril, master of three camels [Kuoril the camel man, of the city\nof Samanud,] and Abba Gize.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Jacob (James) and Piles (Pilses), and Theodore,\nthe martyrs.\nAnd on this day also died ‘Akaryos (Abgar), King of Roha (Edessa).  The kingdom of this\nsaint was in the country of Syria, which is called “Saranin,” and in the city of Roha\n(Edessa), and he was a worshipper of idols, and a paralytic, and [although] he had given\n[much] money to the physicians they would not heal him.   And when he heard of the\nworks of our Lord, and the miracles which He performed, and how He healed the sick,\nand cast out devils, and opened the eyes of the blind, and raised the dead, he sent a letter\nto Him, saying, “Peace be unto Thee, O God, Who hast appeared in Jerusalem, in the flesh\nof men.   And peace be unto Thy Father Who hast sent Thee down without Thy being\nseparated from Him.  And peace be unto the Holy Spirit, Who hath whispered in my mind\nthat Thou art His Messiah, and His equal.   Peace be unto Thee, O Thou Who wast\nbegotten in virginity, without the seed of man.   And peace be unto those who have\nbelieved on Thee.  I believe on Thee, and I have turned from the worship of idols to the\nworship of Thee.  Come to me that Thou mayest be King over me, and make my city Thy\nhome (?), and heal my sickness, and cleanse my impurity.  What matter the Jews to Thee? \nThey spit upon Thy Name, and they hurt Thee; they are a nation of men of perverted\ncounsel.  If in times of old they did not believe on Thee when Thou didst bring them out\nof Egypt, by working miracles, and didst feed them with manna for forty years (?), and\nthey murmured against Thee so much that Thou didst deliver them over to destruction,\nhow much less will they believe on Thee when they see Thee clothed in the flesh of earth,\nwhich hungereth and thirsteth?  Dost Thou imagine that their evil disposition will show\nitself differently because Thou art learned in hidden things?”  And these and such like\nthings did the King of Roha (Edessa) send to Him in writing.  And when the messengers\ncame to our Lord, He knew what was in their hearts, and He told them what was in the\nletter before they spoke to Him.  And then He took a piece of white cloth and wiped His\nface thereon, and the exact form and features of His face remained impressed on that\ncloth, and He sent it with Thaddeus, His disciple, [to the King of Roha (Edessa),] saying,\n“Take this picture of My Person, and it shall fulfill for thee all thy wants, and it shall heal\nthee of thy sickness, and shall bless thy city, and direct thy kingdom rightly.  I have tested\nthis picture in fire and in water to see if it would change, [but it did not].”  And when the\nmessengers came to ‘Akaryos (Abgar) they gave him the picture, and he put it in the fire\nand in water, and neither harmed it.  And the city of Roha (Edessa) believed in it, and in\n\nits divine authority, and it worked miracles innumerable.  And the king was healed of his\nsickness and died in peace that day.  Salutation to ‘Akaryos (Abgar), to whom our Lord\nsent an indestructible portrait of Himself.\nAnd on this day also died Kuoril, the camel man.  This holy man was from the city of\nSamnud, and he devoted himself to fasting and to prayers, and God gave him the\nknowledge of mysteries, and of things that were hidden.  And he had three camels, which\nhe worked according to his needs, and he used to load them with what he required from\nthe flax fields, which he possessed.  And he had a certain man, who was one of the men of\nFaragun, and who was a chief priest of the shrine of our Lady Mary of that city, and his\nfather had held the [same] office before him; and this church possessed much money\nwhich had been given thereto by kings and governors.  And he used to have charge of the\ntreasury, which was hidden, and the bishop and he, who was under him, that is to say, this\nchief priest, knew the amount of treasure therein; and then, suddenly, without uttering a\nword to his son, he died.  When the bishop heard of his death he came to the church and\ndemanded the money from his son, who said, “I do not know where the treasury is, and\nmy father, whom the hand of death hath snatched sway suddenly, hath never told me.” \nWhen the bishop heard this he was wroth and he wished to torture him, and the man said\nto the bishop, “Wait until I have looked for the place where the treasure is, and if I do not\nfind it do with me what thou wilt”; and to this the bishop agreed, and fixed a time.  And\nthe young man went into his house and told his wife all the trouble.  And she said unto\nhim, “Put thy trust in God, and go to the monks, the fathers of Dabra Abba Makara, and\nask them and their neighbors for they will tell thee.”  And when he had arrived there he\nasked the monks with tears to make themselves masters of [his] sorrow; and not one of\nthem could tell him anything.  Then a certain solitary made a sign to him, and said unto\nhim, “Go to Samnud, and enquire for Kuoril an owner of camels, and tarry with him, and\nhe will tell thee [where it is].”   And when he had come into the city of Samnud, and\nenquired for Kuoril, the people told him [where he was]; and when he arrived there he\nfound him in his house and his three camels were with him.  As soon as Kuoril saw him,\nhe knew by the Spirit everything, and what he wanted, and then he brought him into his\ndwelling and offered him food.  And the young man said unto him, “O my father, I cannot\neat until I have finished my errand”; and Kuoril said unto him, “Thine errand shall be\nfulfilled.”  And after supper each man went to sleep in his abode.  And at midnight Kuoril\nthe camel man saw a vision of that man standing by his camels, and when he bowed the\nman bowed with him, and when he prayed the man prayed with him.  And on the morrow\nhe took his camels into the desert to load them with the flax, which he needed, and that\nman [of the dream] went with him to help him.  When they arrived in the fields Kuoril\ntook one camel to load him with flax, and that man took the second camel to load him, but\nhe put a load on the camel’s back which was beyond his capacity to carry, and overloaded\nhim very much indeed; and when the animal wanted to raise his load he was unable to\nmove.  And that man took a stick to beat him, but the camel cried out in human speech,\nsaying, “O my father Kuoril, do not let this man ill-treat me; he hath loaded me beyond\nwhat is right for me.”  And Kuoril came and lightened the weight of the camel’s load, and\nhe said unto that man, “O my son, why didst thou load him with a weight heavier than he\ncould carry?  Wouldst not thou be sorry if one laid a heavy load upon thee, and a labor\nwhich thou couldst not perform?”  And then when they came into their abode he asked\nhim about his sorrow so that he might tell him and reveal to him the place of the treasure;\nand having made him to swear that he would not repeat his words to anyone else, he said\nunto him, “There is at the east end of the church a little box, and therein is the treasure.” \nAnd when the young man went into his house, he told his wife, and they went together to\nthat place and found there a treasure the like whereof in quantity doth not exist in the\ntreasuries of kings; and he told the bishop, who took charge of it.  Salutation to the blessed\nKuoril.\nAnd on this day also the men of Akmim became martyrs.  They were gathered together in\nthe church on the festival of the Nativity, which is to be praised! And they were\nperforming the service of the consecration of the Offering, and they saw our Lord sitting\nupon the Tabot (tabernacle) administering the Holy Mysteries to the people.  And whilst\n\nthey were enjoying this happiness Arianus came and attacked them, and he entered the\nchurch and seized the two prefects of the city whose names were Behwafa and Wenin, and\ncut off their heads with the sword.  After that he slew the deacons, and the sub-deacons,\nand those who sang (i.e. the choir), and the steward of the church, and he left not alive\nneither woman nor child; and he slew so many that the blood ran out of the door of the\nchurch and along the road for a distance of twenty cubits.  And Abba Venudius, the\nbishop, and Dioscurus, and Saclabius and his brethren who were with them, Arianus took\nwith him bound in fetters.  And behold the memorial of their martyrdom is written in the\nsection for the First Day of the month of Ter.  Salutation to your blood, O ye martyrs of\nAkmim, which was shed mercilessly.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

now this Constantine loved Arius, and he\nbelieved his polluted belief.   When the emperor heard that Saint Abba Paul had\nexcommunicated the Arians, and had exiled them from the city of Constantinople, he\nwas exceedingly sorry, and he said unto Saint Paul, “Henceforward let the Arians\nalone, and excommunicate them not.”  And the archbishop did not obey his words,\nand therefore Constantine was wroth with him, and he exiled him from the city of\nConstantinople, just as he had exiled Abba Athanasius from the city of Alexandria\nbefore him.  And the two archbishops Paul and Athanasius foregathered in the city of\nRome with Saint Abba Julius, the Archbishop of the city of Rome, who accorded\nthem a splendid and a loving reception.  And he wrote for them a letter to the Emperor\nConstantine, and he said concerning them, “They are learned, and righteous and\nOrthodox men, and it is meet for thee to receive them and to honor them.”  When the\nArchbishops Abba Paul and Abba Athanasius had arrived in the city of\nConstantinople, and the emperor had read the letter of the Archbishop of the city of\nRome, he was afraid of them, and he received them and placed them in their offices,\nand waited to deal with them for a few days, and after this he exiled them.  And they\nreturned to the city of Rome, to the Archbishop Abba Julius, and they told him how\nConstantine had treated them, and how he had exiled them a second time.  And Julius\ntook them and brought them to the Emperor Kuenseta (Constans), the brother of\nConstantine, and told him how his brother had treated them.   And Kuenseta\n(Constans) wrote a letter to his brother, and commanded him to receive them, and he\nsaid unto him, “If thou dost not receive them there will be no peace betwixt thee and\nme, henceforward.”   And the archbishop also wrote unto him a second letter, and\nConstantine accepted the letter of his brother Kuenseta (Constans) and the letter of the\narchbishop, and he set the two archbishops in their offices.  When certain men slew\nthe Emperor Kuenseta (Constans) in the city of Rome, his brother Constantine turned,\nand he exiled Saint Paul to the country of Armenia, and shut him up in prison there\nfor a few days.  Then the Emperor Constantine sent a letter to one of the followers of\nArius, and he said unto him, “Kill Paul in the prison house.”  And that man who was\nan infidel came to the holy man by night, and strangled him, and he died in peace; and\nall the days of his life were forty years.\nAnd on this day died Saint Cyriacus the martyr and Hannah his mother; now he was\ncondemned to death by Elianus (the Emperor Julian according to the Bodleian ms.)\nbecause he was a bishop.  When he confessed Christ, Elianus commanded his soldiers\nto cut off his right hand, saying,   “This is thy hand wherewith thou writest, and\nwherewith thou dost prevent men from worshipping idols”; and Saint Cyriacus said, \n“Thou hast done well, O thou dog lacking understanding.”  When Elianus heard this\nhe commanded his soldiers to boil some lead and to pour it into his mouth, and he\nmade them lay him upon a red-hot iron bed.   And they strewed over him red-hot\nburning coals, and they rubbed salted fat into him, and they beat his belly and his\nback with rods until his bones broke.  And the righteous man endured these tortures\npatiently, and he prayed in the Hebrew tongue, saying.  [Here follows a transcript into\n\nEthiopic letter of fifteen words in which the saint beseeches Adonai, the God of\nDeath, to keep death from him.]  Then Elianus commanded them to release him, and\nhe lay him down in the prison house.   And Elianus made them bring Hannah, the\nmother of Cyriacus, and he commanded them to suspend her by her hair, and to\nscrape her with shards for three hours.  And he also commanded them to burn her\nbody with fiery torches, and whilst praying she delivered up her soul.  Then Elianus\ncommanded them to bring Saint Cyriacus, and to cast him into a large pit wherein\nwere serpent and vipers, but none of them injured him.   And when ‘Admon\n(Admonius), whom Hannah had saved for Christ, saw this he cursed the king and\nreviled his gods; and forthwith Elianus commanded them to cut off his head with the\nsword.  And the holy man stretched out his neck, saying, “O God of Cyriacus, receive\nmy soul”; and he finished his martyrdom.  And Elianus commanded his soldiers to\ncast Saint Cyriacus into a vessel of boiling oil, and he also commanded them to drive\na spear through his breast, and thus he ended his testimony and died in peace on the\nday of the Sabbath.\nSalutation of Cyriacus, who informed the Empress Helena concerning the place where\nthe Cross was to be found; the knowledge of this place he had obtained from his\nfather.\nSalutation to Hannah the martyr, and salutation to ‘Admon (Admonius).\nAnd on this day are commemorated James the apostle, the son of Alphaeus, and\n“Adrawos, and ‘Awaras, and ‘Aldrakwos the martyrs, and ‘Endronos (‘Adronos?).\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and Eli the\npriest thought that she was drunk with wine, and he was wroth with her, and he\nrebuked her and said unto her, “Why dost thou drink wine, and come hither to the\nhouse of God?”  And she said unto him, “I have not been drinking wine at all, I am\nsuffering, but in my heart, because I have no son.”  And Eli the priest comforted her,\nand blessed her, saying, “Go in peace; the God of Israel shall grant thee thy petition”;\nand she believed his word, and she went to her husband, and she conceived and\nbrought forth a son, and she called his name “Samuel,” which is, being interpreted,\n“God hath heard me.”  And when she had taken him from the breasts, she took him up\nto the house of the Lord, even as she had vowed, and she brought him to Eli the priest,\nand made him to know that she was the woman who had prayed to God and entreated\nHim to give her a son.  And she said, “Behold, God hath heard my petition and hath\ngiven me this son; and behold, I have brought him to God so that he may minister in\nHis house all the days of his life.”  Then she praised God in that well-known hymn of\npraise, which is the third of the hymns that are written at the end of the Psalms of\nDavid the prophet.  And she lived after this and was well pleasing unto God, and she\ndied in peace.\nSalutation to Hannah.\nAnd on this day died Saint Abba Pantaleon of the cell.  This holy man was the son of\nnoble folk, who were among the great ones of Rome, and who sat on the right hand of\nthe emperor.  When his mother had weaned him she took him to a monastery where\nhe grew up in wisdom and exhortation, and fasting and prayer.  Then he traveled to\nthe country of Ethiopia with Nine Saints in the days of ‘Al’ameda the king, the son of\nSal’Adab the king, and they lived in Bet Katin.   Then they separated, and Abba\nPantaleon went up to the top of a little mountain, and he made himself a cell which\nwas five cubits long, and two cubits wide, and three cubits deep; its roof was a single\nstone, and it had no door, but only a small opening.  And he stood on his feet for a\nperiod of five and forty years, without sitting down, and without lying down to sleep. \nHe ate and drank so little that his skin cleaved to his bones, and his eyelashes were\nworn away by his tears.  And he continued to work innumerable miracles in healing\nthe sick and in opening the eyes of the blind.  One day he planted a tree at dawn and\nby the time the evening came it had grown very tall, and had dried up, and his disciple\nhad prepared (?) it and burned it, and tied up the charcoal in his garment and taken it\nfor the censer.  When Caleb was going forth to wage war against another king, he\ncame to Abba Pantaleon and embraced his cell, and told him his trouble.  And Abba\nPantaleon said, “Go in peace, for God is able to do all things, and He shall give thee\nvictory over thy enemy”; and to return safely and in peace.  When Caleb the king had\n\ncome to the country of Saba, he made war on the people thereof, and he slew them all\nand conquered them, and there were not left any who were not scattered like leaves. \nAnd all those who saw Saint Abba Pantaleon testified concerning him, saying, “We\nsaw Abba Pantaleon standing with us in battle, and he was overthrowing our\nenemies.”  When Caleb the king returned, having conquered the King of Judah, he\nforsook his kingdom, and became a monk with Abba Pantaleon.  When Saint Abba\nPantaleon had finished his strife, our Lord Jesus Christ came to him and made a\ncovenant with him concerning him that should call upon his name, and celebrate his\ncommemoration, and write an account of his contending; and He said unto him, “It is\nnow sufficient for thee; go to thy rest.”  And straightway his bones broke and he died\nin peace and was buried in his cell.\nSalutation to Abba Pantaleon as the perfect man.\nSalutation, twofold, to Abba Pantaleon who caused the death of 5050 warriors in the\nbattle.\nSalutation to Abba Pantaleon in his cell.\nAnd on this day also the saints Rewak and Antonius, Bishop of Bana, became\nmartyrs.  Salutation to the same.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated Habakkuk the prophet, the interpretation of\nwhich name is “Teacher.”  This holy man was of the tribe of Simeon.  Joseph begat\nYosafet.  He saw and prophesied before the Captivity that the King of Babylon and\nhis soldiers would surround Jerusalem and destroy the Temple; and he wept much and\ngroaned greatly because thereof.  When Nebuchadnezzar the King of Babylon came\nto Jerusalem and besieged it, this righteous man fled to the country of Mestirakina,\nand he departed seeking for the land of Ishmael.   And when the captives returned\nfrom the city of the Chaldeans, that is to say, those who had gone thither from the city\nof Jerusalem and from Egypt, this righteous man was living in his own habitation, and\nwas ministering unto those who were gathering in the harvest from the fields.  When\nhe had taken food to carry to the reapers, he spake unto the men of his house, saying,\n“I am obliged to go to a city which is afar, but I will return speedily.  If I tarry, take\nsome food for the reapers and carry it to them.”  And as he was going along having\nwith him the food which he was to carry to the reapers, straightway the angel of God\nseized him by the hair of his head, whilst the food was still with him, and brought him\nto the cave of the city of Babylon wherein Daniel the prophet lived, now he was lying\ndown before the lions, and Habakkuk brought the food to him and he ate.  Then the\nangel took him by his hand and brought him back to the land of Israel, and\nstraightway he stood up by the side of the reapers who were still eating their meal. \nAnd he never told any man what had happened to him.  He thought that the people\nwould return speedily from the city of Babylon, but he died and was buried in the\ntomb of his fathers many years before the return of the people.   This prophet\nprophesied to the men of the country of Judah, saying, “Ye will most certainly see the\nGentiles despoiling the sanctuary.” and it came to pass even as he said.  And he also\nprophesied and said unto them, “Ye shall afterwards see the glory of God.”  And he\nalso prophesied and said, “The sanctuary shall be rooted up, and shall be given unto\nan alien people.”  And he said, “The covenant of the altar shall be rent and shall be\nsplit up into small fragments, and the top of two pillars shall be carried away, and\nnone shall know whither they have gone.  And the angel must take them into the place\nwherein is planted the wood of the Cross of their Lord, so that God may be known in\nthe desert, and He shall judge those who war against them, the Serpent of olden\ntime.”  And everything has been fulfilled even as he prophesied.  [See Habakkuk 2,\n3.]\nAnd on this day also Saint Dionysius, Bishop of the city of Athens, became a martyr. \nThis holy man was a native of Athens, and he excelled all the men thereof in honor\n(or glory), and in understanding, and in wisdom, and in learning; now he was one of\n\nthe counselors in the Council of learned judges in the city of Athens.  Paul the apostle\ntaught him, and baptized him with Christian baptism, and made him Bishop of the\ncity of Athens.  And he composed many discourses, and among these was one for the\neve of the Sabbath (Friday), which treated of the Crucifixion of our Lord Jesus\nChrist.  One day this holy man was sitting in the House of Wisdom of the city of\nAthens (now it was the day whereon the learned were to hold a meeting therein), and\nhe was sitting upon the throne of state, for he was the chief of all the wise men, and\nthe other wise men were assembling, and at the moment of noon the sun became dark,\nand the earth quaked, and all the people were terrified and feared greatly.  And they\nasked Saint Dionysius and said unto him, “Master, make us to know what hath\nhappened in the world.”  And he took up a book about the world of nature, and he\nlooked at the balance in his mind and understanding, and he enquired concerning the\nrising of the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and he found that they were all in a\nsettled state, and that they had not moved from their courses.  Similarly he looked at\nthe great sea and saw that it was surrounding all the ends of the world, and he found\nthat it too was in a state of peace and quietness.  Then he took up an astrolabe and\nlooked into it, and behold God, ‘El-Maknun, that is to say, the “Hidden,” the Creator\nof the heavens and the earth, came down from the heavens upon earth.  And His own\npeople rose up against Him, and crucified Him.  And straightway he rent his garments\nand sorrowed with a great sorrow.   And the councilors and the wise and learned\nnoblemen asked him to reveal unto them what had appeared unto him in respect of the\ndarkness which had taken place at noon, and concerning the earthquake; and he told\nthem everything which had taken place; and when they heard this they feared with a\ngreat fear.  And he commanded his disciple Josephus to write down everything that\nhad happened during that hour, and the name of that day, and the name of that month,\nand the name of that year; and Josephus wrote down everything that happened\naccording to the command of Dionysius.  And he also wrote upon all the gates of their\nidols which were in their houses, “God ‘El-Maknun, that is to say, the ‘Hidden,’ hath\ncome down from heaven.”  After fourteen years the Apostle Paul came to the city of\nAthens, and he preached therein, by the help of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the\nLiving God - blessed be His Name!  [And he preached how He came down] from\nheaven, and His Incarnation by our Lady Saint Mary the Virgin, and His Passion, and\nHis Crucifixion, and His Resurrection, and His Ascension into heaven, and His\nsecond coming to judge the living and the dead.  When the men of Athens heard the\npreaching of Saint Paul the Apostle, they marveled exceedingly and they ran and told\nSaint Dionysius about it.  And they said unto him, “A certain man came into our city\nthis day, and preached unto us a new god whom we do not know, and whom our\nfathers before us did not know.”  And Dionysius sent a messenger who brought the\nApostle Paul to him, and he said unto him, “Who is this new god whom thou hast\npreached in our city?”  And the Apostle Paul answered and said unto him, “Whilst I\nwas passing through the open spaces of your city I found written upon the doors of\nthe houses of your idols the words, ‘God ‘El-Maknun,’ that is to say, the ‘Hidden\nGod,’ hath come down from heaven; this is He of Whom I have preached unto you.” \nAnd straightway Saint Dionysius commanded his disciple [Josephus] to bring unto\nhim that document which he had written fourteen years ago; and he brought it to him. \nAnd Dionysius asked the Apostle Paul, saying, “When was the sign of Him Whom\nthou preachest [made known]?’  And Saint Paul the Apostle answered and said unto\nhim, “On Friday, in the month of Adar, which is the seventeenth day of the month\nMegabit, at noon, our Lord Jesus Christ was crucified, and the sun became dark, and\nthe earth quaked at that moment.”  When they heard this they all believed on our Lord\nJesus Christ, and they bowed down at the feet of the Apostle Paul, and he baptized\nthem with Christian baptism, and he made Saint Dionysius bishop over them.  Now\nthis Saint Dionysius is he who translated the Ordinances of the Church.  After this he\nwent to the borders of the West in the days of the Apostles, and he performed many\nsigns and wonders.  And the Emperor Domitian, the infidel, seized him and inflicted\nsevere tortures upon him, and then he cut off his holy head with the sword; and\nDionysius received the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of heaven.  After they\nhad cut off his head he walked to stadium holding his head in his hands.  And the\n\nEmperor Domitian also cut off the heads of Josephus and Urianus, the disciples of\nSaint Dionysius.\nSalutation to Dionysius, the friend of ‘Entona (Antonius), Bishop of the city of Bana.\nSalutation to Josephus and Urianus.\nOn this day also ‘Entona (Antonius), Bishop of the city of Bana, became a martyr.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated Enos, the son of Seth, who was the first to call\nupon God.  He lived 190 years and begat Cainan; and all the days of his life were 620\nyears, and he died at the beginning of the Sabbath.\nSalutation to Hermolaus the priest, and to his brother Heracletus, and to his brother,\nthe bishop, and to Pantaleon who, when he prayed whilst the king was cutting off\ntheir heads, caused an earthquake.\nSalutation to father Bestalota Mika’el, the blood of whose body was found to be\nliquid when it was translated to a second tomb.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and he fulfilled all the Law and Doctrines of the Church.  And the people\nchose him and appointed him Archbishop of the city of Rome, and he sat on the\nthrone of Peter the Apostle.  And having sat on the throne of Peter the Apostle, the\nchief of the Apostles, he followed a righteous course and was well pleasing unto God,\nthe Most High.  And he taught the people at all times, and he admonished those who\ntransgressed the commandments of God, and turned them into the way of God.  When\nConstantine the Less was dead the wicked Julian reigned after him, and this wicked\nJulian denied Christ and afflicted the Christian people.  And he threatened Saint Basil,\nsaying, “I am going to lay waste the churches of the Christians and destroy them,” but\nGod destroyed Julian the infidel through the prayer of Saint Basil.  It was then that\nGod sent the honorable Saint Mercurius, the martyr, and he destroyed that serpent. \nNow Saint Basil stood before a picture of Saint Mercurius, and he said unto him,\n“This infidel told me that he would destroy the churches, therefore I beseech thee to\nkill him in the war”; and Saint Mercurius in the picture nodded his head as if to say,\n“Yea, I will.”   This Julian the infidel was the son of the sister of his father\nConstantine, and he opened the temples of the idols and afflicted the Christian people,\nand tortured very many of them.  And this Saint Liwaryos (Liberius) came from the\ncity of Rome to the city of Caesarea, and he visited Saint Basil, and the two agreed\ntogether to go to the city of Antioch, and they visited Julian the infidel and turned him\nfrom his apostasy and error.  Now these two men had known him from their youth,\nwhen they were fellow-learners in school with him; and they rose up and journeyed\nand arrived in the city of Antioch where the Emperor Julian was.  And having stood\nup before him they wanted to speak to him and to turn him from his error.  And he\nsaid to them, in mockery of our Lord Jesus Christ, “Where did ye leave the son of the\ncarpenter?”  And Saint Basil answered and said unto him, “We left Him making a\ncoffin for thee, and when thou art dead they will bury thee therein in hell.”   And\nJulian was wroth with them, and he commanded his soldiers to shut them up in\nprison; and they shut Saint Basil and Saint Liwaryos (Liberius) up in prison.  And\nSaint Liwaryos (Liberius) saw a vision in his sleep, and in it he was in prison, and\nSaint Mercurius said unto him, “Verily I will not permit this infidel to utter\nblasphemies against my God.”  And Saint Liwaryos (Liberius) woke from his sleep\nand told Saint Basil of the vision, which he had seen; and Saint Basil had also seen\nthe same vision.  Afterwards came the news of the killing of Julian the infidel, and\nafter him Womanyos reigned, and he believed on our Lord Jesus Christ.   And he\nbrought the saints out of prison, and they departed, each of them, to his see.  Now it\nwas Saint Mercurius who killed Julian the infidel at the entreaty of Saint Basil.  And\nSaint Liwaryos (Liberius) departed to the city of Rome, and he debated fiercely with\nthe followers of Arius, and he excommunicated them and exiled them from his see. \nAnd he followed a righteous course, and was well pleasing unto God, and he died in\npeace, after ruling his see for six years.  Salutation to Liwaryos (Liberius).\nAnd on this day died Abba Athanasius, Archbishop of Antioch.  This holy man was a\nmonk, and anchorite, and one who served the Lord his God strenuously, and he was\nsincere and humble and perfect in all good works.  And all the bishops came to him to\nmake him archbishop, and they sent to the Maphrian (i.e., the head of the Jacobite\nChurch), the Bishop of the city of Seleucia, saying, “Behold, our father the\n\narchbishop, Abba Michael, is dead, come quickly and speedily so that we may appoint\nan archbishop.  We have chosen a righteous man who is suitable for this holy office,\nand we are all waiting for thee, for there is none save thee who can appoint him,\naccording to the Ordinances of our Fathers.”  And having waited for the arrival of the\nMaphrian, the bishop, now they had waited for a period of fifty days, they appointed\nAbba Athanasius, and they departed each to his seat.   And the Maphrian came\naccording as the bishops sent to him, and when he arrived at the city of ‘Amid\n(Diarbakr) on the frontiers of Syria, he met the bishops of Antioch, and they told him\nthat having waited for his arrival fifty days they had appointed an archbishop.  When\nthe Maphrian heard this he was exceedingly wroth and said, “Is it thus that ye violate\nthe law which is between us and you?”  Having thus said he anathematized everyone\nwho should mention the name of Abba Athanasius, whether at the service of the\nOffering or at the beginning of incense; having thus spoken he returned to his city. \nWhen Athanasius heard this thing he was exceedingly sorry, and he said unto his\ndisciple, “O my son, be obedient unto me, and do what I say unto thee so that my soul\nmay be blessed, I am going afar off for one year, and if my people seek for me tell\nthem, ‘He is in his cell’; and do thou command them with my voice, bind and loose”;\nand his disciple said unto him, “I will.”  And Abba Athanasius arrayed himself in poor\nraiment, and he traveled on foot until he came to the city of Seleucia, and he knocked\nat the gates of the bishop, and the gatekeeper said unto him, “What dost thou want?” \nAnd Athanasius said unto him, “I wish to receive the blessing of my father the\nbishop.”  When the gatekeeper had told the bishop he brought Abba Athanasius, and\nthe bishop said unto him, “Whence art thou?”  And he said unto him, “I have come\nfrom the country of Syria, lacking daily bread and raiment, so that I may die under the\nshadow of thy prayer.”   And the bishop said unto him, “Art thou a priest or a\ndeacon?”   And he said, “Neither.”   Then the bishop called the steward and\ncommanded him to place him with the monks.   And Abba Athanasius performed\nevery kind of household work, even to the drawing of water, and the carrying away of\nthe dung of the horses and the mules, and the lighting of the fire, and there was no\nkind of work for the brethren which he did not perform.  When he had finished the\nwork in the bishop’s house he used to go to the houses of the monks, and draw water\nfor them, and light fires, and clean the houses, and at length the brethren loved him\ndearly and regarded him as a heavenly angel, and then they entreated the bishop to\nmake him a deacon.  And on the first day of the week the bishop went into the church\nand called Abba Athanasius in order that he might appoint him a deacon, but\nAthanasius wept bitterly and said unto him, “Leave me, Father, I am a poor man, and\nI am not fit for this grade.”  When the bishop seized him with vigor, Athanasius said\nunto him, “Forgive me, Father, for I am a deacon, but on account of my many sins I\nhave abandoned ministration.”  When the bishop heard this he marveled at his patient\nendurance; and for six months Athanasius continued to perform the duties of a\ndeacon.   When the bishop saw his great intelligence (or knowledge) he wished to\nappoint him to the work of a priest.  And the first day of the week the bishop came\ninto the church, and he called Athanasius and said unto him, “The Holy Ghost hath\ncalled thee this day; I am going to appoint thee a priest.”  When Abba Athanasius\nheard him, he fell down at the feet of the Father in tears, and he entreated him to let\nhim alone.  When he knew that the bishop would not excuse him, he said unto him,\n“Have mercy upon me; I am a priest.”  When the father and the monks heard this they\nrejoiced in him and honored him exceedingly.  When the bishop saw the wisdom of\nhis words and the zealousness of his ministration, he wished to make him a bishop of\na city the bishop whereof was dead.   And he summoned the archbishops, and the\nbishops, and the priests, and the deacons, and the monks, in order that they might\nappoint him on the first day of the week.  And he called Abba Athanasius and said\nunto him, “ This day God hath called thee to the grade of the episcopate of such and\nsuch a see.”   And when Athanasius knew that he would not excuse him, he wept\nbitterly and told them that he was Athanasius Archbishop of Antioch, and he related to\nthem the history of his coming in secret.  When the father heard these words from him\nhe put off his crown and fell down upon the earth and became as one dead for a long\ntime.  Having raised himself up, he cried out to the bishops and the people, and said\n\nunto them, “O my brethren, tell me what I shall do, for at this moment I am afraid that\nfire will come down from heaven and consume me, and that the earth will open her\nmouth and swallow me up.   Is it a desirable thing that Athanasius Archbishop of\nAntioch should serve the dung of horses like a slave?”  When the bishops and the\npeople heard these words they bowed low before him and kissed his hands and his\nfeet.  Then the bishop commanded the bishops to bring fine apparel of the priesthood,\nand the cross and the staff of the priesthood, and they seated him upon the throne, and\nthe bishops carried him and his throne upon their shoulders, and they brought him into\nthe church, and they carried him round about it thrice, saying, “Akseyos, Akseyos,\nAkseyos,” that is to say, “He is worthy, He is worthy, He is worthy.”  Then he put on\nthe vestments for the consecration of the Offering, and he consecrated the Offering,\nand administered it to them and he blessed their city.  How great was the joy of the\nPersians!  And on the following day the father brought a mule, and everything which\nwas necessary for the journey, and he mounted Abba Athanasius upon it, and he\ndeparted to the city of Antioch with archbishop and bishops who traveled on foot. \nAnd Abba Athanasius said unto the Maphrian, “Do thou mount and let us travel\ntogether.”  And the Maphrian said unto him, “Far be it from me, O Lord!  Inasmuch as\nthou didst come on thy feet to my city I will go on my feet to thy city.”  When the\nBishops of Antioch heard that the Archbishop Abba Athanasius had arrived, they\nwelcomed him and the Maphrian, the Bishop of Seleucia, and they restored\nAthanasius to his throne and they rejoiced with great joy.  Then they set on their way\nthe metropolitans and bishops, and they returned to their city in peace.  And this father\nlived a beautiful life, and he tended his flock with righteousness and integrity, and he\ndied in peace.  Amen.  Salutation to Athanasius, Archbishop of Antioch.\nAnd on this day also died Stephen, the son of Nikomion and brother of Basilides. \nThis blessed man Stephen belonged to an honorable family, and his parents were\namong the nobles of Antioch; they were exceedingly rich in gold, and silver, and\nglorious apparel, and their slaves and handmaidens were innumerable.  And Nikomion\nloved Christ exceedingly, and he gave alms to the poor and needy, and he was beloved\nby all men.  And having begotten this holy man, he had him brought up carefully, and\nhe taught him the Psalms of David, and the Books of the Old and New Testaments,\nand finally he was filled with the knowledge of the Holy Ghost.  He learned to ride\nthe horse, to hurl the spear, and to draw the bow with Victor and Claudius in the house\nof Saint Basilides, whose brother’s son he was, and because of this he was called the\nson of Basilides.  All his kinsfolk were fearers of God, and they walked in all His\ncommandments and judgments, and among them was none whose heart was not\nwarmed by the flame of the love of Christ, and there was none who turned from His\nway either to the right hand or to the left.  When God saw the strength of their love\nfor Him, He wished to make them to inherit His kingdom and His righteousness,\nwhich He hath prepared for them before the world was created.  Then Satan brought a\nman, a certain swineherd from the land of Egypt, and he belonged to men who occupy\nthemselves with devices for war, and his name was ‘Agripada, and from his earliest\nyouth the spirit of Satan dwelt in him.  When he came to Antioch they made him\nmaster of the horse, and when the King of Antioch died the throne was empty.  One\nday when the daughter of the king was walking about on the roof of her house, she\nsaw him leaping about with his horse whilst the musicians played music on their\ninstruments.   Thereupon she lusted for him, and she married him, and finally she\ncaused him to be made king, and she called him Diocletian.  And O what violence,\nand O what wickedness were committed in his days after he had denied Christ!  He\nworshipped idols and killed everyone who believed on Christ.  He was an eater of the\nflesh of men, and a drinker of human blood, like the wild animals.  He seized and\nscattered all the chosen people of the kingdom like rams who have no shepherd. \nSome of them were killed by means of stakes driven through them, and some of them\nhe drove into exile, even to districts in Egypt, and they were fettered with iron chains,\nand gags were in their mouths.  At length the whole country of Antioch was filled\nwith weeping and lamentation, a man mourning for his wife, and a wife for her\nhusband, a father mourning for his son or a son for his father, or brother for brother\n\nand friend for friend.  At length the whole earth was filled with the blood of the saints,\nand their bodies were cast out into the streets of the city, and there was none to bury\nthem except the watchmen of the city, to whom bribes had to be given secretly to bury\nthem.  And this Saint Stephen continued in prayer to God by day and by night that He\nwould give him a crown of martyrdom.  Now as a beginning to his iniquity Diocletian\nwrote an Edict which he sent into every part of his dominions, saying, “I Diocletian\nthe Emperor, Lord of the World, hereby command that in every country of my\ndominions they close the churches, and open the houses of idols (i.e., temples), and\nworship my gods, for it is they who have given me victory in battle.  Whosoever shall\nnot worship them and bow down before them, his house shall be plundered and laid\nwaste, and he shall be punished with every kind of punishment; none shall be spared,\nneither rich nor poor, nor great nor small.”   Then the emperor assembled all his\nsoldiers and all the nobles of his kingdom, and he commanded that this Edict should\nbe proclaimed before the multitude.  When Saint Stephen had heard the foul Edict his\nwhole body burned with the fire of zeal, and he accounted Diocletian as nothing, and\npoured out blasphemies upon him, and he was greatly moved in his spirit and said,\n“What is this new act of violence which thou hast made manifest, O king, in this city,\nby writing this unclean and accursed Edict of Apollo (?)? For our Lord Jesus Christ\nshall defend everyone who believeth on Him.”  Then Saint Stephen waxed strong and\nbold and he leaped upon the soldier who had the filthy Edict in his hand, and tore it\nout of it, now the emperor and all his nobles were looking on at him, and Stephen tore\nthe Edict in pieces.   And the emperor said unto him, “O Stephen, what hast thou\ndone?  Dost thou wish to bring destruction upon thyself?”  Then the emperor drew the\nsword, which he had in his hand, and he hacked him down the middle, and he became\ntwo parts.   And the head of Saint Stephen remained for a long time before the\nemperor, and it reviled him and told him what would come upon him in the later time,\nand how he would received alms in the gates of Antioch, and how his eyes would be\nmade wholly blind, and how after this he would be destroyed.  And the head cried out\nwith a loud voice and repeated the names of all the saints of the city of Antioch who\nbecame martyrs.  And the story of the head of Saint Stephen was heard in all the cities\nof Antioch, and many multitudes of people gathered together to see the head, which\nreviled the emperor and told him of his ruin.  When the emperor saw that the head of\nthe saint spoke of his destruction before the assembled multitude he was greatly\nashamed, and he commanded his soldiers to take it away, and whilst they were doing\nso it continued to talk and would not be silent; and when they buried it in the earth it\nstill uttered many words.  And this head remained buried in the earth for three days,\nand all the people heard it talking to the emperor and reviling him, even as the head of\nJohn the Baptist reviled Herod in days of old; for Herod and Diocletian were alike in\nnature and disposition.  Herod was led astray through fornication, and the drinking of\nwine, and at length he killed the Prophet John greater than whom there was none born\nof woman.  Through the murder of the righteous man he acquired disgrace, and as for\nhis wife, the earth swallowed her up; her daughter perished and he himself bred\nworms in his body, and he putrefied and he died in shame, wishing to hide his\nfornication.   The head of Saint John reviled Herod boldly, and the head of Saint\nStephen reviled Diocletian, who was wishing to prove boldly the greatness of his\nidols and their gods, and proclaimed boldly that there were devils in his gods.  And\nthe head prophesied to him that his kingdom should be broken and his eyes blinded,\nand that he should receive alms in the gates of the city, and that he should die in\ndisgrace.  When Diocletian saw that the head of Saint Stephen would not keep silent,\nhe ordered them to cast it into a lead box and to seal the mouth thereof, and to throw it\ninto the sea by night; and by this act the martyrdom of Saint Stephen was finished. \nThen the angel of God came down from heaven, and brought out the box of lead and\nlaid it on the seashore.  Whilst his mother was searching for his body by the will go\nGod she came to the place where the box of lead was, and she took it from there and\nlaid it up in her house until the days of persecution were passed; and she lighted a\nlamp at his grave which burned by day and by night.  After the days of persecution\nwere passed she built a fine church for him, and innumerable signs and miracles were\nwrought therein.  Salutation to Stephen, the son of Basilides.\n\nAnd on this day also, in the nine hundred and eighty-fifth year of the holy martyrs\n[(A.D. 1269) the Bodleian ms. has A.M. 388], in the reign of Iyob Kher, and in the\ndays when Abba Cyril held office, a stupendous and marvelous thing happened in the\nworld, which terrified those who beheld it, and those who heard thereof on that day. \nThe sun became dark, and it became darker and darker until the day was like night,\nand the stars appeared, and men lighted lamps.  And they feared with a great fear, and\nthey begged for His compassion and mercy, which He promised them, and He\nmultiplied His mercy on them.  And He removed fear from them, and the light re-\nappeared, and the sun came forth according to its custom, and it lighted up the whole\nworld, and men extinguished their lamps.  And the period of the darkness of the sun\nwas one hour, that is to say, from the half of the eighth hour to the half of the ninth. \nAnd additional praise must be given to God because He did not hasten to harm men\nfor their sins, but He made haste to show His compassion and long-suffering towards\nthem; and praise be also to our Lord Jesus Christ forever and ever.  Amen.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated Abba Simeon the Archbishop [or Bishop].\nAnd on this day also Thomas the Apostle began to work like an artisan, and to preach\nin the country of India where-unto he went with ‘Abnes the merchant.  And ‘Abnes\nwent to salute Guendefor the king, and he told him concerning Thomas the carpenter\nwhom he had brought with him.  And the king rejoiced and said unto him, “What is\nthy trade?” And the apostle said, “I am a carpenter and an architect.  And I can make\nwalls of houses, and beds, and scales, and wheels (carts?), and ships, and oars, and\nroyal palaces.”  And the king rejoiced, and he took Thomas to a place where he was\ngoing to build a palace, and he said unto him, “When wilt thou have built [the house]”\nAnd the apostle said, “After two months, [I will begin on] the new moon of the month\nKhedar, and I will finish in the month of Miyazya”.  And the king marveled and said\nunto him, “Every house is built in the summer, then how can this house be built in the\nwinter?”  Then the king gave him much money both for himself and for those who\nwere to work with him, and having taken it, he gave it to the poor and needy, saying,\n“I give what belongs to the king to another king.”  Then the king sent his minister to\nthe apostle to learn if the palace was finished, and the apostle said unto him, “Thy\npalace is finished, but there remaineth the roof to put on.”  And the king sent him\nmoney a second time, and he said unto him, “Finish quickly.”  then when the king\ncame and asked for the palace which Thomas had built, the apostle said unto him,\n“No palace hath been built; there are only the alms given to the poor of thy goods.” \nAnd the king was wroth, and he shut the apostle and the merchant up in prison until\nhe could think out in what way he should kill them.  That night Gadon the king’s\nbrother fell sick and died, and the angels showed him the palace, which Thomas had\nbuilt for Guendefor his brother.  He said unto them, “Who is this palace for?”  And the\nangels said unto him, “This is for the king, and the Apostle Thomas who is in the\nprison house hath built it for him.”  When his soul returned to him Gadon told his\nbrother this, and then they all vied with each other, and they went to the prison house\nand brought out the apostle and the merchant.  And they believed on our Lord Christ,\nand were all baptized, both men and women, in the Name of the Father and the Son\nand the Holy Ghost, and they received His Holy Body and His Honorable Blood. \nThen Thomas laid his hands upon them, and gave them the benediction, and departed\nfrom them.\nSalutation to India and salutation to the Merciful One.\nOn this day is commemorated David King of Ethiopia, who was called the “fan of the\nwicked and the wall of adamant.”\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

And some of them were\nnovices.   The infidel Emperor Julian passed by their house in the city of Roha\n(Edessa) on his way to make war on Sapor, the son of Sapor, the King of Persia, for\nhe had heard that Sapor was coming to make war upon him.  And Julian having gone\nagainst him and come back, he went to that nunnery wherein the virgins lived, and he\nasked [an officer] what the building was.  And [the officer] said unto him, “This is a\nnunnery.” and Julian commanded his soldiers to go into that nunnery, and to kill\neveryone in it, and to carry off all the goods which were therein.  And the soldiers of\nthe infidel emperor went into the nunnery, and they beat the virgins with whips and\ncut off their heads with swords, and they plundered everything which was there.  And\nbecause of this thing the Lord took vengeance upon him with the vengeance of His\nwrath, that is to say, Saint Mercurius the martyr speared him with his spear whilst he\nwas engaged in fighting, and he cast him from his horse, and killed him.  And Julian\ndied an evil death, and he departed to the Sheol which is forever. And these holy\nvirgins went into everlasting joy, and inherited the kingdom of heaven.  Salutation to\nthe virgins whose blood Mercurius avenged.\nAnd on this day also a General Council of the Saints took place in the days of Victor,\nArchbishop of the city of Rome, and in the days of Demetrius, Archbishop of the city\nof Alexandria.  Now the cause for the assembling of this Council was this:  Christian\npeople were baptized on the festival of baptism, on the twenty-first day of the month\nTer (Jan. - Feb.), and from the following day they fasted until the twenty-second day\nof the month Yakatit (Feb. - March), that is to say, for forty days, and then they ate. \nAnd after thirty days they began, on the twenty-third day of Magabit (March - April),\nand kept the Octave of the Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the festival of His\nResurrection, for the Crucifixion of our Lord took place on the twenty-ninth day of\nMagabit.  After Demetrius, Archbishop of the city of Alexandria, had been enthroned,\nGod illumined the heart of a certain artisan, who knew not how to read or to write,\nwith Divine grace, and he learned all the Laws of the Church, and he knew them by\nheart, and he interpreted them.   Then by the Holy Spirit he compiled a table for\nreckoning the Epact, wherefrom men might know [the days of] the Fast, and the\nResurrection; and he wrote in the Coptic and Greek (Rom) tongues.  Then he made a\ncopy of this table of Epact and sent it to Victor, Archbishop of the city of Rome, he\nread it and found it good and rejoiced therein exceedingly.  And he sent and gathered\ntogether a large assembly containing fourteen bishops of his diocese, and many\nlearned priests, and he read to them the calculation of the Epact, and they found it\nvery good, and they rejoiced in it, and accepted it, and they wrote many copies of it\nand sent them into all countries.  And the Holy Fast and the Festival of Easter have\n\nbeen regulated by that circulation from that day to this.  And they departed to their\ncountries praising the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, to Whom be glory and\nhonor.   Salutation to Demetrius and to the priests who made haste to assemble in\norder to make rules for times for keeping Lent and Easter.\nOn this day Paul and his three companions became martyrs.\nSalutation to Gabra Maryam.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and Jesse brought him.  And straightway Samuel\ntook up the horn of oil of kings, and anointed him, and God was pleased with him,\nand he reigned over the children of Israel.   And on this day also God sent Saint\nMichael the archangel to David the prophet, and he helped him and gave him strength\nto slay Goliath, the giant of the Philistines, and deliver the children of Israel.  For this\nreason the doctors of the Church have commanded and ordained that the people shall\nkeep a festival in honor of Saint Michael on the (twenty-second?) day of this month. \nSalutation to Saint Michael.\nAnd on this day Saint Matthew the apostle and evangelist, one of the Twelve\nApostles, became a martyr, after he had preached in the cities of the priests, and\nconverted them to the knowledge of God.  Now it happened that when he wished to\ngo into the city of priests, he found a certain young man who said unto him, “Thou\nwilt not be able to go into this city unless thou shavest off the hair of thy head and thy\nbeard, and carriest palm branches in thy hand.”  And he did even as the young man\ncommanded him, and as he was sorrowing because of this, straightway our Lord Jesus\nChrist appeared unto him under a form, which he knew, that is to say, the form of the\nyoung man who had spoken unto him; and He encouraged and consoled him and then\ndisappeared from him.   When Saint Matthew had entered into the city, he made\nhimself unseen by the people, like one of the priests.  And he went to the temple of\nApollo, and found the high priest, and talked with him concerning the gods, and Saint\nMatthew made him to know that they were not gods; and he wrought miracles and\nwonders before him, and light rose upon them, and a table came down to them from\nheaven.   When Hermes the priest saw this wonderful thing he said unto Saint\nMatthew, “What is the name of your god?”  And he said, “The Name of my God is\nChrist,” and straightway Hermes the priest believed on our Lord Jesus Christ, and\nmany people believed with him.   When the king of this city heard this thing he\ncommanded his soldiers to burn them in the fire.  And at the moment the son of the\nking died, and Saint Matthew made supplication to our Lord Christ, and he raised the\nking’s son from the dead; and straightway the king and all the men of the city\nbelieved.  Then Saint Matthew appointed a bishop and priests over them, and he built\na church for them, and he went forth from the city to the cities, which were outside,\nand he converted them and brought them to the knowledge of God.  Before this Saint\nThomas had been to the City of the Blessed, and he saw our Lord coming to them at\nall times, having with Him the souls of babes, which were in number eighteen\nthousand.  And on the first day of every feast our Lord Christ cometh to them, and\nwith Him are His angels.  And these blessed ones are they to whom Simas the desert\npriest went, and he was witness of their strives, and of their marvelous works.  After\nthis Saint Matthew the apostle and evangelist went to the city of Jerusalem, and the\n\nland of Judah, and he wrote his Gospel in the Hebrew language.  Then he went to the\ncity, which is outside, and he found therein a certain man who was in prison; now\nSaint Matthew used to visit those who were shut up in prison.  And the man had to\npay back to his lord the money, which he had given him to trade therewith, together\nwith a profit thereon, but he dropped it into the sea and lost it.  And Saint Matthew the\napostle said unto that man, “Go thou to such and such a place, and what thou findest\ntherein take, and give to thy lord.”  And the man went and he found a bag full of gold,\nand he took it and gave it to his master and was saved.   And the story of Saint\nMatthew’s [act] was heard throughout the city, and many men believed on our Lord\nJesus Christ.  When Justus the governor of that city heard that many men believed on\nour Lord Christ, he was exceedingly wroth, and he ordered his soldiers to cut off the\nhead of Saint Matthew, and to cast his body to the fowls of the air.  And they cut off\nhis head with a sword, and certain believing men came and took his holy body and\nlaid it in a holy place.   Salutation to Matthew whose voice compelled the deep to\nrestore from its depths a certain man, the gold, which had sunk in it.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father, the pure virgin, the fighter of lusts, the\nvanquisher of natural appetites, Abba Demetrius the twelfth Archbishop of the city of\nAlexandria.  This holy man was a man of the people (i.e., of lowly origin) and he\nknew not letters, and he used to work in a vineyard.  His parents gave him a wife in\nhis youth, and he lived with her until he was appointed archbishop--forty-eight years. \nBoth husband and wife remained virgins, and no one knew about them except God,\nWho knoweth souls and hearts.  When the time drew nigh for the death of Saint Julian\nthe archbishop, the predecessor of Demetrius, the angel of the Lord appeared unto this\nholy man and told him that Demetrius was to be archbishop after him.  And he gave\nhim a sign concerning him, and said unto him, “Tomorrow a man shall come unto\nthee having a cluster of grapes with him; seize and pray over him, and appoint him\narchbishop.”  When Saint Julian woke up from his sleep, he told the bishops and the\npriests who lived with him what he had seen, and what the angel of the Lord had said\nunto him concerning Demetrius the archbishop.  When the morning had come this\nSaint Demetrius, the archbishop, found in the vineyard a cluster of grapes, which had\nripened before their time, and he took it to Abba Julian the archbishop, so that he\nmight be blessed by him.  And Saint Julian took him by the hand, and said unto the\nbishops and priests, “This is he who shall be archbishop after me.”  And they prayed\nover him, and they took him and bound him until Abba Julian died, whereupon they\nfinished the prayers over him and made him archbishop.  And he was full of heavenly\ngrace, and he was versed in many kinds of learning, and he knew by heart all the\nBooks of the Church and the interpretations thereof, and he read many abstruse\nworks.  It was he who regulated the reckoning of the Epact, for the Christians used to\nkeep the festival of the Baptism, and on the following day [began] the fast of Forty\nDays.  And at the octave of His Passion they celebrated the festival of the Passion of\nour Lord by itself, and this they did from the days of the Apostles until the days of\nthis father.  And this father proclaimed the reckoning of the Epact by the Holy Spirit,\nand he regulated the reckoning of the Holy Fast.  And he sent out letters [concerning\nit] to the Archbishops of the city of Rome, and of the city of Ephesus, and of the city\nof Antioch, and of the city of Jerusalem, and they rejoiced thereat, and they ordered\n[the Holy Fast] even as it is at this day.  And God was with this Father Demetrius\nbecause of his sincerity (or purity).  He used always to look for our Lord Jesus Christ\nat the time of the consecration of the Offering as he was administering the Holy\nMysteries to those who were meet for them; and he drove away sinners, and said unto\nthem, “Go ye and repent, and afterwards come and ye shall receive the Holy\nMysteries; ye shall not receive them whilst ye are in sin so that ye may not go into\nGahanna.”  And Saint Demetrius used to reveal their sins to the people, those that they\ncommitted in secret, and he would rebuke each one of them for the sins, which they\ncommitted.  Because of this believers were afraid of him, and the members of his\ncongregation did not commit sin because of their exceedingly great fear of him, and\nbecause they did not wish him to put them to shame before the congregation.  And\nsome of the people whom he used to rebuke for their sins would say among\n\nthemselves, “This man is married, and his wife is with him at this present, why should\nhe rebuke us especially?  None but a virgin should be appointed to the throne of Mark\nthe evangelist.”   One night an angel of the Lord came to him and said unto him,\n“Demetrius, permit not thyself only to do as thou pleases, and permit not thy neighbor\nto be destroyed.  Remember that our Lord Christ saith in the Holy Gospel, ‘The good\nshepherd giveth his life for his flock.’”  And Demetrius said unto him, “What is it that\nthou wouldst say unto me, my lord?”   And the angel said unto him, “Reveal the\nmystery which is between thyself and thy wife to the people.”  On the following day\nthe festival of Pentecost was celebrated, and this holy Father Demetrius consecrated\nthe Offering, and he commanded the archdeacons to tell the priests and all the people\nwho were there that they were not to leave the church, but to stay together therein;\nand the archdeacons did as the archbishop had commanded.  When the priests and the\npeople were assembled he commanded that much wood should be brought and that a\nfire should be made of it, and [when] they had done so, this Abba archbishop rose and\nstood up in the midst of the fire whilst all the people were looking on.  And he prayed\nfor a long time, and then he spread out his garment and took some of the fire with his\nhand and placed it in it.  Then he called his wife, and she came unto him, and he said\nunto her, “Spread out thy woolen head-cloth,” and he cast some red-hot charcoal into\nit, and then he said unto her, “Stand up that we may pray.”  And the red-hot charcoal\ncontinued to burn in the woolen head-cloth, and the cloth was not burned; and they\nremained in this position and prayed for a long time.  After this the priests and the\npeople asked him, saying, “We require thy holiness, O our father, to make us know\nwhat this mystery is.”  And he said unto them, “I have not done this seeking for the\nvain praise of this world, but behold, I have lived with this woman for eight and forty\nyears, until this day.   Now this woman whom thou seest was the daughter of my\nfather’s brother.  Her relatives died and they left her, then a little girl in my father’s\nhouse, and I was brought up with her.  When I was fifteen years of age my father gave\nher unto me in marriage.  When we entered the marriage-chamber in our house, she\nsaid unto me, ‘Why have they given me in marriage to thee, seeing that I am thy\nsister?’  And I said unto her, ‘Dost thou wish us to live together in one house, and\nnever to separate from each other, and to preserve our virginity undefiled, and that\nthere shall be nothing between us?’  And she said, ‘Yea.’  And I have lived with her in\none place for eight and forty years, and we have lain in the same bed on one\nbedstead.  And the Lord God Who is judge between us, and Who knoweth what is\nhidden and the thoughts of hearts, He knoweth that I have never known her as a\nwoman, and on her part she doth not know me as a man, but we have passed all these\ndays just lying side by side.  When we lift ourselves up we see as it were a face,\nwhich resembleth that of an eagle in our bed, between me and between her.  And he\nlayeth his left wing over her and his right wing over me, and this he doeth from the\ntime we lie down until the morning, and then he disappeareth.  Now do not think, O\nChristian people, that I have revealed this matter unto you because I am seeking the\npraise which men desire in this world, but God hath commanded me to reveal unto\nyou this mystery, for He wisheth what is good for all men--the Christ, the Redeemer\nof all the world.”  And in the days of this father certain evil men appeared whose\nnames were Kalemos and ‘Aganos, and others with them, and they wrote a lying\nbook; and Demetrius anathematized them and excommunicated them.  And during the\ndays of his office he taught and encouraged the Christian people, and all believers,\nevery day regularly.  When he was grown old and feeble they used to carry him on a\nlitter, and set him down in the church, and he taught the people all day long from\nsunrise to sunset, and all the people pressed eagerly to hear his doctrine.  And all the\ndays of his life were one hundred and five (six?) years.  Of these were fifteen during\nwhich he was unmarried, and eight and forty years passed before he was appointed\narchbishop, and he held office of archbishop for three and forty years; and he died in\npeace.  Salutation to Demetrius.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated the righteous men Peter, and Dionymus (or\nDiyonas), and the strife of Ya’ekob, and Abu Tefa, and Theodore.\n\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and He chose [also] Twelve Apostles, [and] of their\nnumber were the seven deacons whom He appointed for them.  And this holy man\npreached in the cities of Samaria and baptized [men therein] with Christian baptism. \nAnd he baptized Simon the magician, who perished when he wished to buy with\nmoney the gift of the Holy Spirit.   And the angel of the Lord appeared unto this\ndisciple Philip, and he commanded him to go by the way of the country of Gazu.  And\nhe rose up and went there, and he found the eunuch, the steward of Hendake\n(Candace), the Queen of Ethiopia, and he was reading in the Book of Isaiah the\nProphet.  And the words which he was reading said, “Like a sheep he came to his\nslaughter, and like a sheep that bleats not before him that will shear him” (Isaiah, 7\n(53:7)); and this disciple Philip explained to him the meaning of the words which he\nwas reading.  And he said unto him, “This is a prophecy concerning our Lord Jesus\nChrist, Who suffered of His own free will for the salvation of man.”  And the eunuch\nbelieved through Philip the disciple, and he asked him to baptize him, and Philip did\nso.  After he had baptized him the angel of the Lord carried Philip the disciple to the\ncity of ‘Azdad and he preached therein.   And he departed to Asia, and there he\npreached the Gospel, and there were four sons who preached with him.  And having\nconverted many of the Jews and Samaritans, and other peoples, and brought them into\nthe Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, he died in peace.  Salutation to Philip and to his\nfour sons who prophesied.\nAnd on this day also died the holy Father Moses, the man of God.  This holy man was\na native of the city of Byzantium; his father’s name was Euphemianus, and his\nmother’s name was Aglaias.  And they were exceedingly rich, and their possessions\nwere very many, and their slaves were more numerous than those of any others of\ntheir family, and they were arrayed in rich apparel, which was embroidered in gold,\nand they wore girdles of gold.   And they feared God and performed His\ncommandments, and they fasted every day until the ninth hour, and they only ate once\nin the day, and then it was with the poor and the needy.  And they had no children, and\nthey used to entreat God the Most High to give them a son, blessed and good, who\nshould do God’s good pleasure.  And God heard their petition and gave them a son\nwho was very handsome in person, and the grace of God was upon him.  And they\nrejoiced in him with a great joy, and they made great festival for the poor and needy,\nand they multiplied their well doing.  And they called that son Moses, which being\ninterpreted is “man of God”; for God heard their petition for him.  And they brought\nhim up very piously, and they taught him all kinds of learning and spiritual wisdom. \nWhen the child had grown up, his father Euphemianus said unto his wife Aglaias,\n“Behold our son Moses hath arrived at man’s estate, and it is meet that we should give\nhim in marriage to a wife.”   And his mother rejoiced at these words, and they\nbetrothed him to a daughter of one of the nobles of the city of Byzantium, whose\nperson was exceedingly beautiful.   And they made a great feast to celebrate his\nmarriage, and they decorated the church of God, that is to say Hagia Sofia in the city\nof Byzantium.  And they made Moses to stand with his wife before the Tabernacle,\n\nand they crowned him with the holy crown of matrimony, and they received the Holy\nMysteries and they came to their house in peace.  And Euphemianus said unto his\nfriend, “Tell the bridegroom to come into the marriage-chamber to his bride, and let\nhim rejoice in her after the manner of men.”  When Moses the man of God heard this\nword, he came into the marriage-chamber, and he saw the maiden, and he marveled at\nher person exceedingly, and he praised God, and blessed Him, and he thought within\nhimself, saying, “Will not all this beauty of person pass away and decay and become\ndust?”   And he entreated God to guide him into the path of the kingdom of the\nheavens.  And he said unto the maiden, “Peace be unto thee, O my sister, thou noble\nmaiden!”  And he stripped himself of his glorious apparel and gave it unto her, and\nsaid unto her, “Have me in remembrance, O my noble sister, until we meet again\nbefore our Lord Jesus Christ.”  And having said this unto her he went forth from her\nand he departed by road until he came to a city, which is on the seashore.  And he\nwent into the city, and sold all his raiment, and gave the price thereof to the poor and\nneedy, and he dressed himself in rags like the beggars and he went from one place to\nanother begging bread and eating it, until he came to the city of Roha (Edessa).  And\nhe went into the church in the city wherein is the picture of our Lord Jesus Christ\nwhich our Lord sent unto Eugyanos, the King of Roha (Edessa), and he prayed before\nthe picture of our Lady Mariyam and was blessed by her.  And he gave thanks unto\nGod, the Most High, and he went out of the church and sat down with the poor and\nneedy, and he lived upon the bread of charity.  He fasted always until the evening, and\nhe prayed by day and by night, and wept without ceasing.  When his father and his\nmother came into the marriage-chamber, and did not find their son Moses, their joy\nwas changed to sorrow.  Then Euphemianus called his servants, and gave them much\ngold, and he said unto them, “Go ye into every city and country, two of you into each\ncity, and give alms to the poor from that gold for the sake of my son Moses.”  And\ntwo of his father’s servants came to Moses, and gave him alms with the [other]\nbeggars.  Now Saint Moses knew these servants, but they did not know him, and he\nsaid, “I give thanks unto Thee, O my Lord God, that Thou hast esteemed me fit for\nthis great honor, that is for me to receive alms from the hands of my father’s servants\nfor the love of Thy Name.”  Now his father’s servants continued to go round about\nthrough many cities for many days [seeking him].   After they had returned to\nEuphemianus their lord, the father of Saint Moses, the man of God, they said unto\nhim, “We have come into every city and we have not found thy son.”   And Saint\nMoses, the man of God, was fasting two days at a time, and then three days at a time,\nuntil at length he did not eat at all except on the First Day of the week.  After this our\nLady Mariyam appeared unto one of the righteous elders among the priests of that\nchurch, and she said unto him, “Go outside the church, and say unto that man who is\nstanding by the pillar, ‘Come, O man of God,’ and bring him into the sanctuary for his\nfasting, and his prayer, and his righteousness have ascended like the sweet-smelling\nincense into heaven.”   And on the following day that priest came to him at the\nmoment when they were offering up the Offering upon the altar, and asked him to\ncome into the sanctuary.  And Moses wept and entreated him, saying, “Forgive me, O\nmy father!  I am a sinner, and I am not worthy to stand in the holy place.”  And the\npriest said unto him, “O man of God, come into the sanctuary, for I am sent unto\nthee”; and he told him how our Holy Lady the Virgin Mariyam had appeared unto\nhim, and how she had spoken unto him concerning him.  And Moses said unto him, “I\nam a sinful man, and the greatest sinner in all the world.”  After this he rose up to go\nto the city of Tarses, which is the city of Paul the Apostle, and he said, “I will dwell\nherein until the day of my death.”  Then he thought in his heart and said, “Verily this\nis the Will of our Lord Jesus Christ; the Name of the Lord is living.  I will not hide\nmyself from any man, and I will not separate myself from the gates of my father’s\nhouse, for who is there among the people here who will know me?”  So he went to his\nfather’s house.  And as he was going along he saw his father and very many men\nfollowing him, and Moses, the man of God, went and laid hold of the bridle of his\nfather’s horse as he was sitting on it, and he said unto him, “O good and blessed man,\nmay God forgive thee thy sins, and grant thee the petition of thy heart.  Know now\nthat I am a pilgrim and a stranger, if thou wishest to feed me with the broken meats of\n\nthy table, God the Merciful will magnify thy reward, if thou wilt have mercy upon my\npoverty and my wandering.”  When Euphemianus heard these words he thought of the\nwandering of his son Moses, the man of God, and tears burst from his eyes and he\ngroaned within himself.   And he took Moses with him into the house, and he\ncommanded his servants to give him a seat before the door of the house, and they did\nfor him even as he had commanded, and he commanded one of his slaves to serve\nhim.  And Moses, the man of God, said unto that slave, “I entreat thee, O my brother,\nto bring me food and drink only on the First Day of the week, and then only bring me\na part of a loaf of bread and a cup of water, after I have received the Holy Mysteries.” \nAnd he continued to lead this life of self-abnegation and strife for a period of twelve\nyears, sitting at the door of his father’s house.  And God wished to remove him from\nthe toil of this world, and our Lord Jesus Christ appeared unto him, and said unto him,\n“Blessed art thou, O Moses, My chosen one, for thou hast done My good pleasure,\nand thou hast loved sorrow far more than joy, and thou hast forsaken riches and\nsought after poverty.  I, even I, say unto thee, that everyone who hath called upon thy\nname, or hath celebrated thy commemoration, or hath fed the hungry on the day of thy\ncommemoration, or hath given the thirsty to drink, or hath clothed the naked, or hath\nwritten the book of thy strife, I will reward them with a splendid reward in the\nkingdom of the heavens; and in this world I will protect them from all evil, and I will\nnot permit them to lack any good thing.  And now, O my beloved Moses, thou man of\nGod, after four days I will take thy soul from thy body, and I will set thee with the\nsouls of the righteous, and of the prophets, and apostles, and martyrs.”  And having\nsaid these words He gave him “peace,” and went up into heaven.  When the holy man\nsaw this vision he rejoiced and was exceedingly glad.  And he said unto that slave\nwho ministered unto him, “Bring hither to me paper and ink, and henceforward thou\nwilt have rest from labor for me”; and the slave marveled at his words and brought\nhim the paper and ink.  And Moses, the man of God, wrote the full history of his\nstrife, from the beginning even unto the end thereof.  On the fourth day he took the\npaper, which he had written in his hand, and he died on the First Day of the week, and\nhis soul went up into the heavens, and the angels and the righteous, and the martyrs,\nand the prophets, and the apostles welcomed it, saying, “Hallelujah! Redeemer our\nGod”, and they came into the heavens.  And all the people were gathered together in\nthe church at the time of the consecration [of the Offering], and they heard a voice\nabove the altar crying out, and saying, “Blessed are the good servants who have\nperformed the commandments and the ordinances of their Lord, for they are in joy for\never.”   When the archbishops, and priests, and deacons, and bishops, and all the\npeople heard this voice, great fear, and severe quaking fell upon them until the end of\nthe consecration; and they received the Holy Mysteries.   And afterwards the\narchbishops, and all the priests, and the people entreated our Lord Jesus Christ to\nreveal unto them this mystery.   And straightway a voice was heard which said,\n“Rejoice with Moses, the man of God, in the house of Euphemianus, for behold, he\nhath delivered up his soul into the hand of God.”  And when the archbishop heard\nthis, he called Euphemianus and said unto him, “This great joy which dwelt in thy\nhouse; Why didst thou not inform me about him so that we might have visited him\nduring his life and been blessed by him.”  And Euphemianus answered and said unto\nhim, “Thy holy prayer is certain.  Thou must know, O holy father, that I did not know\nthat the like of this man existed in my house.”  And straightway the archbishops, and\nthe priests, and all the people went to the house of Euphemianus, and they found\nMoses, the man of God, where he died with the paper in his hand.   And the\narchbishop took the paper out of his hand, and he read it before all the people until he\ncame to his name, which was Moses, the man of God, the son of Euphemianus and his\nmother Aglaias.  When his father and his mother heard this they wept bitterly.  Then\nthe archbishop wrapped him in silk cloths, and they took him and carried him into the\nchurch and laid him in the sanctuary until all the people and the priests had been\nblessed by him.   And immediately very many sick people came, the deaf and the\nblind, and they all received a blessing from his holy body, and they were all healed of\ntheir sicknesses.  When the people became very many his father was afraid that they\nwould overturn the body of the saint from his bier, and he commanded his servants to\n\nscatter money among the people.  And the servants scattered much gold in order that\nthey might leave the body of the saint, but they would not go after the gold, and no\nman ever returned afterwards to the gold.  After this they laid the body of the saint in\nthe great church of the Apostles Peter and Paul.   And many miracles took place\nthrough his body, the blind were made to see, and the dumb became able to speak, and\nthe sick were healed, and the lame walked, and the deaf heard, and the lepers were\ncleansed, and from those who were possessed of devils the devils went out. \n[Salutation to] Moses, whose name is written on a pillar of gold in the Jerusalem of\nthe heavens.\nAnd on this day also died Saint Gabra Krestos, the son of Theodosius, Emperor of\nConstantine.  Now Theodosius was a God-loving man and one who feared God, and\nhis wife was a good and God-fearing woman, and her name was Markiza; and they\nwere sorrowful because they had no son.  And they went to Jerusalem, and they made\nvows, and they made supplication to God, and He heard them and gave them a son,\nand they called his name ‘Abd Almasih, that is to say, Gabra Krestos.   And they\ntaught him every kind of learning on the earth, and there was nothing, which he did\nnot learn.  Afterwards they married him to a princess of Rome, and they brought to\nhim the bride, and they performed for him all the ceremonies, which are wont to be\nperformed for the bridegroom and bride.  And at midnight Gabra Krestos took the\nbride by the hand, and they made a covenant together, and then they recited the prayer\nof belief--”We believe in one God”--to the end thereof.  Then he stripped off himself\nthe marriage-garments, and dressed himself in coarse apparel, and he went to the\nbride and kissed her head, and he bade her farewell, saying unto her, “God be with\nthee, and deliver thee from every evil work of Satan.”  And she wept and said unto\nhim, “Whither goest thou?  And to whom wilt thou leave me?”  And he said unto her,\n“I have thee to God, and I am going to follow Christ, for my father’s kingdom is a\ntransitory thing.   Remember thou thine oath”; and straightway she was silent and\nremembered her oath.  And he went forth by night whilst those who belonged to the\nmarriage-chamber were sleeping, and he came to the sea-shore where he found certain\nmen who were about to sail, and they took him with them.  And when his father and\nhis mother went into the marriage-chamber, and found only the bride and not the\nbridegroom, they said unto her, “Where is our son?”  And she said unto them, “He\ncame in to me in the night, and made me swear an oath, and made a covenant with\nme, and he kissed my head, and went away from me, and I have passed the night\nweeping.”   When they heard her words, they fell down upon the ground, on their\nfaces, and they groaned, and uttered loud cries of grief and lamentation.   And the\nEmperor Theodosius sent out five hundred of his servants to seek his son, and he gave\nthem much gold to distribute among the poor in alms.  Now Gabra Krestos arrived in\nthe country of Armenia after a journey of one year.  And there was a church built in\nthe name of our Lady Mariyam, and he lived there for five years fasting and keeping\nvigil.  And two envoys, servants of his father, arrived there, and they searched for him\nbut were unable to hear any news of him; and they gave alms to the poor, and Gabra\nKrestos himself received some of them.  After he had dwelt there for five and twenty\nyears, our holy Lady the Virgin Mariyam appeared unto certain priest, and she said\nunto him, “Take the man of God with thee, and let his habitation be inside [the\nchurch]”; and he did as she had commanded him.   And Gabra Krestos said, “My\nLady, why dost thou reveal my secret?”   And he bade farewell to her picture (or\nimage) and he departed by night and came to the seashore, where he found a ship in\nwhich he embarked.  Now he wished to depart to another country, but by the Will of\nGod he arrived at his father’s city, and he dwelt there of fifteen years and no man\nrecognized him.  And his father’s servants used to make sport of him; but Saint Gabra\nKrestos said, “[O God] punish not my father’s servants for their offence, but take me\nto Thyself”; and thus saying he died, and they buried him with honor.  As they were\nburying him they found a paper grasped tightly in his hand and they were unable to\nremove it, and they prayed together to the God of heaven; and when they had prayed\nthe paper was released from his hand, and they read it, and they knew that he was\ntheir son.  Then they wept bitterly, and they buried him, and his tomb became a place\n\nwhere the sick were healed, and where the blind [were made to see], and where many\nmiracles were wrought, and where countless acts of grace were performed.  Salutation\nto Gabra Krestos, whose sores the dogs licked in the courtyard of his father’s house.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated our holy Father Aragawi, who is surnamed Za-\nMikael.  This holy man became a guide to the servants of God on the road.  And he\nwent up to the holy Dabra Damo holding the tail of a serpent, and there he fought\ncountless noble fights.  And God graciously made a covenant with him concerning the\nman who should call upon his name, and the man who should celebrate his\ncommemoration, and then he was hidden from the face of death by the grace of God. \nHe established among his children the Rules for the Monastic Life, which he had\nlearned in the house of his father Pachomius.   Salutation to Za-Mikael who was\nsurnamed “’Aragawi.”\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Tarakwa the martyr, and those who were\nwith him, and Damatius, and Emraya the martyr, and the four hundred and thirty-one\nmartyrs who were with her.\n \nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

such are the sacrifices wherewith God is well pleased.” \nKuelkuelianus said, “Did not Paul sacrifice?” and Filias said, “God forbid!” \nKuelkuelianus said unto him, “Did not Moses sacrifice?”  And Filias said, “Unto the\nJews only was the command given that they should sacrifice in Jerusalem.” \nKuelkuelianus said, “Dost thou strive on behalf of the soul or the body?”  And Filias\nsaid, “On behalf of soul and body.”  Kuelkuelianus said, “Will this body rise?”  And\nFilias said, “Yea.”  Kuelkuelianus said, “Hast thou no love for wife or brethren?”  And\nFilias said, “The love of God is greater than every other love.”   Kuelkuelianus said,\n“Who is God?”  Filias raised his hand to heaven, and said, “God is He Who made the\nheavens and the earth and everything which is therein,” and he told him the story of His\nBirth, and His Crucifixion, and His Death, and His Resurrection and Ascension. \nKuelkuelianus said, “Can God be crucified?” And Filias said, “Because of love for us\nHe came into the world, and redeemed us by His Passion.”  Kuelkuelianus said, “Dost\nthou not know that I would honor thee, and that I do not wish to harm thee, for I know\nconcerning the abundance of thy wealth, and the honor of thy family.  Now, sacrifice\nthou to the gods so that thou mayest not die an evil death.”  And Filias said, “If thou dost\nwish to give me pleasure, give the order for my torturing and slaughter”;

and he wrote in that Epistle\nthe Orthodox Faith of the Holy Three Who are equal in Godhead.  Then he went on to\nspeak about the Incarnation of the Son of God, and he said, “The Word of God took a\nbody, perfect in all its operations, with a rational and understanding soul from our holy\nLady the Virgin Mariyam.   And He became therein One Son, and One Person, in\ninseparable unity, and He did not become two, but One, for the Holy Three were One\nGod, before the Incarnation of the Son, and after the Incarnation of the Son there came\nnot upon Him any addition to His Incarnation.”  When his Epistle reached Saint Abba\nSeverus, and he had read it, he rejoiced and was glad therein with an exceedingly great\ngladness.  And he preached about it before the people of the city of Antioch, and they all\n\nrejoiced therein.   Then Saint Abba Severus wrote to him, and accepted his Epistle,\nsaying, in his letter, “I give thanks unto God Who hath chosen thee for this glorious and\nOrthodox Christian office,” and he commanded him not to turn aside from it neither to\nthe right hand nor to the left, and that all his words and works should be performed\naccording to the Orthodox Faith which our holy fathers had formulated, that is to say the\nThree Hundred and Eighteen bishops who assembled in Nicea, and according to what\nthey had commanded in the Canon and the Law.  And then he said in his letter, “Teach\nthy people continually, so that they may be strong in the Orthodox Faith, and let them\ndiscuss this matter very much.”   And when the letter of Abba Severus reached\nDioscorus, he rejoiced therein greatly, and he commanded that it should be read from the\npulpit.   And this father taught the people continually, and read to them the Holy\nScriptures, and commanded all the priests in the cities to shepherd their flocks, and to\nprotect the sheep, which had been committed to their charge.  Having ended his good\ncourse, and pleased God, he died in peace.  Salutation to Dioscorus the writer.\nAnd on this day also died Stephen, Archdeacon and Protomartyr.  Salutation to Stephen.\n \nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and in his days also died Abba\nCyril, Bishop of Jerusalem; and in his days also rose up (i.e., awoke) the seven children\nafter they had been asleep for three hundred and seventy-two years.  And this holy father\nwas a disciple of Athanasius, the apostolic Archbishop of the city of Alexandria, and this\nSaint Theophilus was brought up in the cell of Saint Athanasius, and he learned from\nhim all spiritual doctrine.   When Abba Timothy the archbishop died, this father was\nappointed in his place.  And he was prudent, and observant, and he learned the Books of\nthe Church by heart, and he understood the interpretation of the same.  During the days\nof his office he wrote great discourses, and many works of exhortation concerning love\n(i.e., charity), and concerning the Resurrection and the punishment, which is prepared\nfor sinners, and other treatises, which tend to edification.  And Saint Abba Cyril was the\nson of the sister of this father, and he brought him up most carefully and piously.  And\nhe sent him to Abba Serapion so that he might instruct him carefully and thoroughly in\nspiritual matters, and father Abba Serapion taught him every kind of spiritual learning,\nand he learned by heart all the Books of the Church.  When his education was complete\nAbba Theophilus sent and brought him to his cell.  And used to make him read before\nhim continually books concerning the people.  When this father Abba Theophilus was\nwith Abba Athanasius, he one day saw him lifting up his eyes to a hill, now he was\n[standing] before his cell, and he heard him say, “If I find good days I will clear away\nthis hill, and I will build on the site thereof a church to Saint John the Baptist and Elias\nthe prophet.”   And when this Father Abba Theophilus was appointed Archbishop of\nAlexandria he remembered that hill concerning which he heard Abba Athanasius speak,\nand determined that he would do and carry out what he had heard Abba Athanasius say\nhe would do.  And in those days there was in the city of Rome a certain woman who was\nexceedingly rich; now her husband was dead, and he had left her much property, and she\nhad two sons.  And she took her two sons, and the money, which she had with her, and a\npicture of the angel Raphael, and she departed from the city of Rome to the city of\nAlexandria.  And when she heard Abba Theophilus speaking about that hill, straightway\nshe became moved by the zeal of the Spirit, and she spent much money and cleared\naway that hill, and there appeared underneath it a coffer which was covered over with a\nslab of stone whereon were written (or engraved) three characters which were O O O. \nAs soon as Theophilus saw them he knew their mystery through the Holy Spirit, and he\nsaid, “Behold, the time hath arrived wherein this coffer should be brought to light, for\nthe three characters upon it are O O O, and behold, they were gathered together at the\nsame time.   One O standeth for Theos, that is God; the second O standeth for the\nEmperor Theodosius, and the third O standeth for Theophilus the archbishop, that is to\nsay a holy three (?).”  And having said this he opened the coffer and found written inside\nit the date according to the Era of King Alexander, the son of Philip, the Macedonian,\nand it was seven hundred years, from the time when they closed [the coffer].  And the\nArchbishop Abba Theophilus sent to the Emperor Theodosius the Less, the son of the\nEmperor Arcadius, the son of Theodosius the Great, and he informed him about the\ncoffer, and how he had opened it, and he said, “Come, that thou mayest see it.”  And the\nemperor came to the city of Alexandria, and he looked at the coffer, and he gave half of\n\nthe treasure inside it to the blessed Theophilus, and a half of it he placed in a ship and\ntook to the city of Constantinople.  And the blessed Theophilus built churches with the\ngold, which the emperor had given him.  And he began to build first of all a church in\nthe names of John the Baptist and Saint Elijah, and he translated their bodies and laid\nthem in it, and this church is well known to this day in Demas.  And at that time he also\nbuilt a church in the name of our holy Lady the Virgin Mariyam, by the hands of the\nMelchites in the east of the city.  And thirdly, he built a church in the name of the angel\nRaphael in Daset, and he built seven other churches; and then he appointed the sons of\nthat widow bishops.   When the emperor saw the love of the archbishop for building\nchurches, he gave him all the houses of idols which were in the whole country of Egypt,\nand Theophilus pulled them down and built on their sites churches and lodging houses\nfor strangers and pilgrims, and he endowed them with land and other property.  And\nhaving followed in this good course of action, and pleased God, he departed to God and\nwent to his rest from the toil of this world, after sitting upon the throne of Mark the\nevangelist eight and twenty years.  When this father administered Christian baptism he\nused to see a rod of light before him making the sign of the Cross over the place of\nbaptism.  And this father and the Emperor Theodosius were cutting wood, and each of\nthe two saw a vision on the same night wherein it seemed that one of them was to\nbecome emperor and the other archbishop; and it came to pass to them even as they had\nseen in the vision.   In the first year wherein this father was made archbishop, the\nEmperor Theodosius commanded that each of them should write down their belief in\nbooks, and that they should bring them to the emperor, and they did as he had\ncommanded and brought the books to the emperor.  When they had drawn nigh unto\nhim, the emperor rose up and prayed, and then he laid the books on the altar.  And God\nrevealed unto him that there was nothing in them about the Orthodox Faith except that\nthey said and believed that “the Son with the Father and with the Holy Spirit is One\nGod.”  And the emperor commanded [his servants] to cast forth all the books wherein\nevil belief and words of doubt (or hypocritical words) were written, and the emperor\nexpelled all those who were in doubt about their belief from his kingdom.  And John of\nthe Mouth of Gold multiplied his reading in the Books of ‘Awgaryos (Abgarus), and this\nfather Theophilus sent a message to Epiphanius, Bishop of Cyprus, and to all his own\nbishops, ordering them to anathematize the Books of ‘Awgaryos (Abgarus), and they\nanathematized them even as did Theophilus the archbishop.  When John of the Mouth of\nGold heard that Abba Theophilus the Archbishop of the city of Alexandria had\nanathematized the Books of ‘Awgaryos (Abgrus), he abandoned them and never read\nthem again.  And [he died] the seven hundred and twenty-first year of King Alexander,\nthe Two-horned (A.D. 410).  Salutation to Theophilus who was worthy to sit upon the\nthrone of Mark the evangelist.\nAnd on this day also died Romanus the martyr in the days of Asclepianus, the governor\nwho persecuted the Christians.  This Romanus had been a monk from his earliest years,\nand he devoted himself strenuously to fasting and prayer.   When he heard that the\ngovernor was persecuting the Christians, he came into the church, and he gathered\ntogether the priests and the deacons, and admonished them in the Faith of Christ, and\nstrengthened them with his own confidence.   When Asclepianus heard this he\ncommanded that Romanus should be summoned, and when Romanus stood before him,\nhe said unto him, “Is it true that thou art the son of Feyum?”  Romanus said unto him,\n“What doth glory of kin profit me?  My glory is Jesus Christ.”  When Asclepianus heard\nthis he commanded his soldiers to hang him up and to scrape his limbs piecemeal [and\nthey did so], and when the governor saw his patient endurance, he commanded them to\nslit his cheeks so that he might not be able to talk.  And Romanus said, “Behold, my\nGod hath uncovered my mouth so that I may admonish thy madness.  If thou wouldst\nknow the truth of the matter, command thy servants to bring hither a child, and he will\ntell us whether it is right for us to worship God or the gods.”   And the governor\ncommanded them to bring a little child, and he said unto him, “Tell me is it right for us\nto worship God or the gods.”  And the child said, “It is right for us to worship God Who\ncreated all the world with one word”; and having heard him the governor commanded\nthem to hang up the child.  When they had hung up the child his mother came to look at\n\nhim, and the child said unto his mother, “Give me water, for I am thirsty.”  And his\nmother said unto him, “Nay, O my son, thou must not drink water [here], but go to the\nwater of life.”  When the governor heard her words he commanded them to cut off the\nhead of the child; [and they did so], and his mother came and took away his body.  And\nthe governor commanded them to cut out the tongue of Romanus at its roots so that he\nmight not be able to argue with him.  And Romanus having received by the grace of God\na tongue of the Spirit, he wrote with his blood, saying, “Blessed are those who do not\ndeny our Lord, for the Son will confess them before His Father.”  When Asclepianus\nheard this he imagined that the tongue of Romanus had not been cut out, and he called to\nthe prefect, and said unto him, “Why didst thou not cut out his tongue at its roots?”  And\nthe soldier said, “Command them to bring the soldiers and I will cut out his tongue\nbefore thee, and thou shalt say if he speaketh.”   And straightway they brought the\nsoldiers and they cut out his tongue, and he died forthwith.  When the governor saw him\nhe commanded the soldiers to bring him into the prison house, and there they hanged (or\nstrangled) him; thus he finished his martyrdom.  Salutation to Romanus the martyr.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated John the martyr, and ‘Adrani, and\n‘Artematewos, and Hephaestus, and Luderius, and ‘Asmanit, and his seven children.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and the soldiers did as the governor had commanded them, and\nBartholomew and his wife finished their strife; and received crowns of martyrdom in the\nkingdom of the heavens.  Salutation to Bartholomew and his wife who were buried alive\n[in the days of the Emperor Diocletian].\nOn this day also the holy General Council assembled in the church of the city of Antioch\nbecause of Paul of Samosata.  This wretched man was a native of the city of Samidat,\nand was made Archbishop of Antioch.  And Satan sowed bad seed in his heart, and he\nused to believe that Christ was a mere man whom God created, and that God chose Him\nso that by Him He might redeem the children of men, and that the source of Christ was\nMariyam entirely, and that His Godhead was not one with His manhood, but that it\ndescended upon Him, and that He dwelt therein by the Will of God, One Nature; and he\nwould confess neither the Son nor the Holy Spirit.  And this Council assembled in the\ncity of Antioch because of him, and this assembling took place in the reign of the\nEmperor Valerius, when Dionysius was Archbishop of the city of Alexandria, and\nDionysius was Archbishop of the city of Rome; and this Council assembled before the\nCouncil of Nicea five and forty years.  Now Abba Dionysius, Archbishop of the city of\nAlexandria, was old, and he was not able to come with them into the Council, but he\nwrote a letter to the Council, saying, “Christ is the Word of God, and is His Son, and is\nequal with Him in Godhead and Nature.   And the Trinity [containeth] Three distinct\nPersons, and one God and one Lord.  And One [Person] of the Trinity, that is to say, the\nSon, became incarnate in the substance of a complete man, and there was with Him One\nNature.”   Then Dionysius testified concerning these things and adduced many\ntestimonies from the Old and New Testaments.  And Dionysius sent this letter with two\npriests and thirteen bishops assembled and they debated the matter with Paul the infidel. \nAnd they read out before him the letter of Dionysius, and they rebuked him with the\nwords of Paul the apostle, who said, “Christ is the Word of God, and He is His Son, and\nthe splendor of His glory, and the likeness of His glory, and the Substance of Godhead.” \nBut he would not accept their words, and he would not turn from his infidelity, and they\ncut him off, and anathematized him and excommunicated him, and they\nexcommunicated all those who believed his words, and drove them from their thrones. \nAnd the Council formulated Canons, and they are in the hands of the believers who\nperform their Laws and Precepts.  Salutation to the two priests and thirteen bishops.\nOn this day also died Saint John of Dailam.  The parents of this holy man belonged to\nthe nobles of the city; his father’s name was Abraham, and his mother’s name was Sara,\nand they continued to pray fervently for many days because they had no children.  One\nday two monks came to visit him, and they sojourned in his house, and they said unto\nhim, “O Abraham, hast thou no children?”  And he said unto them with tears, “O my\nfathers, I have not gotten a son.  And now I have grown old, and as for my wife her days\nare past”; when the monks heard this they prayed over them, and blessed them and\ndeparted.  After a few days Sara, the wife of Abraham, conceived and she brought forth\na child of joy, and Abraham called his name John.  When fourteen years had passed, and\nwhen the boy had finished all his instruction in the Books of the Church, those two same\n\nmonks came into the school, and when John saw them he asked them to take him away\nwith them.  And they said, “We are afraid of thy father and we cannot take thee.”  Whilst\nthose monks were departing to their abode John prayed to God that He would direct the\npath which he had chosen, and he went out of the school and followed the monks, and\nwhilst wishing to overtake them he came to a great river which he was afraid [to try] to\ncross by himself.  Whilst he was there certain Arabs came with their camels, and John\nasked them to take him across the river, and they took him over with them; and by the\nWill of God he arrived in the monastery of these monks.  Now the name of one of these\nmonks was Abba Simon, and when he saw John he knew him, and he received him, and\nmade him his disciple and Abba Simon had two other disciples besides John, but he\nloved John more than them.  When Abba Simon knew that his departure was nigh, he\nsaid unto his children, “O my children, I will tell you what God hath shown me in\nrespect of what shall happen unto you after my death.  One of you a hyena shall seize,\nanother of you shall be scattered in the earth, and of my third disciple the report shall go\nforth into all the world.”  Then the old man looked in the face of John, and he said unto\nhim, “Be strong, O my son, for the love of Christ, for He hath chosen thee to be a father\nunto many”; and thus saying the old man died.  After three days one disciple went out\ninto the world and married a wife, and where the second went is not known.  And Saint\nJohn was sorrowful in his soul and he said, “I will go down and see what hath happened\nto my companion.”  As he was going down a company of soldiers of Dailam met him,\nand they made him prisoner, and fettered him with two beautiful women, one on his\nright hand and one on his left.  Whilst they were journeying along the road the men of\nDailam lacked water both for themselves and for their beasts.  And Saint John said unto\nthem, “Masters, if I make water to spring forth for you will ye let me go?”  And they\nsaid unto him, “Yea.”  Then Saint John knelt upon the ground in the Name of the Father\nand the Son and the Holy Ghost, and water gushed out upon them and they drank.  And\nSaint John said unto them, “Perform to me what ye have covenanted,” and they said,\n“We will not let thee go; who shall we find like unto thee?”  So they brought him to their\ncity.  And in those days a heavy plague descended upon Dailam, and the master of Saint\nJohn died, and his children, and all the men of his house, and there remained only his\nwife and her daughter.   And the wife of Saint John’s master thought that he was a\nmagician, and she shut up Saint John in his room, and set fire to the house so that she\nmight burn him alive, but God delivered him.  When the men of Dailam saw this they all\nbelieved through him, and they were baptized, men and women.  Then John departed\nthence by another road.   When he found that the men there worshipped trees, he\nexhorted them to turn from iniquity, and when they refused to do so he came by night\namong their trees, and prayed to God, and taking an axe [in his hand], he said, “In the\nName of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost I will cut you down”; and\nstraightway one thousand trees fell down at one stroke of the axe.  When the men of the\ncity saw this they believed, and were baptized together with their women and children. \nAnd once again he went to another city, and he found that the people there were\nworshippers in fire-temples.  When John rebuked them, they were wroth, and they cast\nhim into the fire three times, but he came forth unharmed.  And he turned their water\ninto blood, and they lacked water to drink, and they all believed in the God of Saint\nJohn, and forty thousand men were baptized.  Then he built a church and performed\ncountless signs and wonders, and he died in the country of Der’Eyan.  Salutation to John\nof Dailam.\nSalutation to Abba Simon, who was enveloped by the Holy Ghost.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated the righteous men of Al-Matra, who were slain\nwith violence by the hands of evil men.  [The Bodleian MS. says they were slain by\nKing Yemraha.]\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

they were not rich in the goods\nand possessions of this world, but they were rich in good works.  When this holy man\nwas eighteen years of age, the grace of God moved him to go to the desert of Scete,\nwhich [name] being interpreted means, “Balance of hearts.”  And he wished to put on\nthe garb of the monk.  And he found a certain tried and strong old man, whose name was\nAbba Bamoy, of the city of Seha, dwelling in Scete, and Saint John bowed low before\nhim and entreated him that he might dwell with him in Scete.  And Saint Abba Bamoy\nwished to try him, and he said unto him, “O my son, it is not right for thee to live here,\nfor this is a very hard desert, and those who dwell therein have to work with their hands,\nand they can only feed themselves by hard toil.  And also over and above this there are\nvery many fasts to be kept, and many prayers, both by day and by night, to be said, and a\nman must sleep on the bare ground naked without a bed (or cushion), and there is very\ngreat hardship in this desert.  Nay, my son, go back into the world and live a life of\ncomfort and ease like unto that of all other men.”  And Abba John said unto him, “O my\nfather, for God’s sake do not turn me back for I have come to be under thy authority and\nunder the shadow of thy prayer.  And if thou wilt accept me I believe that God will make\nthy heart will-disposed towards me.”  Now Saint Abba Bamoy was wont never to do\nanything hastily, and he entreated God concerning Abba John so that He might reveal to\nhim His works.  And the angel of the Lord appeared and said unto him, “God saith unto\nthee; accept this brother, for he shall become a chosen vessel.”  And when Abba Bamoy\nheard these words from the angel of God, he brought Abba John into the church, and he\nshaved off the hair of his head.  Then he laid out the garb of the monk, and he stood and\nprayed over it for three days and three nights.  Then the angel of the Lord appeared, and\nmade the sign of the Cross over the raiment of monkhood, and Abba Bamoy put it upon\nAbba John.  And Abba John devoted himself with the greatest zeal and diligence to the\nsplendid works of the ascetic life.  One day Abba Bamoy wished to try him, and he sent\nAbba John away from him, saying, “I cannot live with thee”; and Abba John stood for\nseven days outside the gates of the monastery, and every day Abba Bamoy went out to\nAbba John, and smote him with a stick, and Abba John bowed down before him and\nsaid, “Forgive me, O my father.”  On the seventh day the old man Abba Bamoy went\nforth to go to the church, and he saw seven angels, and they had with them seven crowns\nwhich they were placing on the head of Abba John.  And straightway Abba Bamoy took\nAbba John and brought him into his cell, and from that day onward he was held by him\nin honor and reverence.  One day Abba Bamoy found a piece of dry wood and he gave it\nto Abba John and he said unto him, “Take this wood and plant it in the ground, and\nwater it until it sprouteth and bringeth forth fruit.”  And Abba John obeyed Abba Bamoy,\nand he took that piece of wood, and planted it, and watered it each day twice; now the\nwater was far off, a distance of twelve stadia.  And after three years that piece of wood\nsprouted, and grew into a large tree, and bore fruit, and the old man Abba Bamoy took\nsome of the fruit thereof and carried it to all the aged monks, and he said unto them,\n“Take ye and eat of the fruit of obedience and humility.”  When the monks saw this\nmiracle they marveled exceedingly, and they praised God Who gives this virtue unto\nthose who make themselves subject to His teachers.  And Abba Bamoy fill sick of a very\nsevere sickness, and he continued to suffer from this sickness for eighteen years, and\nthough Abba John ministered unto him [all this time] he never once said unto him,\n“Thou hast done well,” for the old man Abba Bamoy had grown very old, and he used to\ntry him exceedingly.  And God tried him with such a severe sickness until at length he\n\nbecame like a piece of dry wood, so that he might become a chosen offering unto God. \nWhen Abba Bamoy was about to die, he gathered together the aged monks, and he\nseized the hand of Abba John and gave it unto them, saying, “Take him, and take care of\nthis man, for he is an angel and not a man.”  Then he said unto Abba John, “After I am\ndead I will live in the place wherein thou didst plant the tree which sprouted and bore\nfruit, for thou in that place didst become a holy and acceptable sacrifice before God. \nAnd many men shall be saved by thy hand, and thy memorial shall be there in that place\nbefore God for ever.”  When Abba Bamoy had said this unto him, he opened his mouth\nand delivered up his soul into the hand of God.  After this Abba John departed to that\nplace [where the tree was] according as the old man Abba Bamoy had told him.  And he\nstrove boldly in the working of righteousness, for his name was exalted exceedingly;\nand after this he was appointed abbot over his church.  And whilst the archbishop was\nlaying his hand upon him at the time of his appointment, a voice came from heaven, and\nall the people heard it, saying, “Axios, Axios, Axios,” that is to say, “He is worthy, He is\nworthy, He is worthy.”  And every time when Saint John consecrated the Offering, he\nwould watch for those who were worthy to partake and those who were not worthy. \nNow Abba Theophilus, the archbishop, built a church to the Three Holy Children in the\ncity of Alexandria, and he wished to bring thereto the bodies of the Three Children from\nthe city of Babylon.  And he asked Saint Abba John to go to the city of Babylon, and to\nbring the bodies of the Three Children from the city of Babylon, and after many requests\nAbba John went forth on behalf of the archbishop.  And a cloud straightway carried him\naway and brought him to the city of Babylon, and he saw that city, and the rivers and the\npalaces thereof, and he saw the bodies of the Saints, the Three Children, and the body of\nKing Nebuchadnezzar lying in their tombs.   And Saint Abba John bowed low, and\nembraced the bodies of the saints with tears, and he cried out saying, “O my holy\nfathers, bless me!”  And straightway he heard a voice from their bodies, saying, “The\nGod of Israel hath blessed thee.”  When Abba John had heard this voice he was filled\nwith the Holy Spirit, and rejoiced in the spiritual blessing.  And he said unto them (i.e.,\nthe bodies), “O my fathers, ye martyrs of Christ God, I tell you that our father the\narchbishop, Abba Theophilus, has built a church in your names in the city of Alexandria,\nand he hath sent me unto you and he beseeches you and your holy bodies to come and\ndwell in your church, so that there may be healing and salvation unto all those who\nbelieve in Christ in all the country of Egypt.”  And the saints answered with one voice\nand said unto him, “God shall give thee the reward of thy labor in the life everlasting! \nBut tell the archbishops that God hath commanded [us] not to remove our bodies from\nthis place until the day of the Resurrection.  Nevertheless because of his contendings,\nand his labor, and his perfect faith, let them suspend lamps, on the night of the day of the\nconsecration of the church, whilst all the people and the priests are assembled therein,\nand we ourselves will come and we will make manifest the power of God and their\nblessing.”   And Saint Abba John bowed low, and went forth from their presence\nrejoicing in God.  When he had departed a short distance from them, a cloud took him\nup and brought him to the outskirts of the city of Alexandria, and he came in to the\narchbishop and told him what the saints had said; and the archbishop did even as the\nsaints had told him.   And when midnight had come on the night of the day of the\nconsecration of the church, the Three Holy Children appeared in the church surrounded\nby brilliant light, and they lighted all the lamps, and they sent forth from themselves an\nexceedingly sweet odor.  After this Abba John returned to Scete, and he contended in the\nworking of righteousness by night and by day.  One day a certain monk came into the\ncave of Abba John, and he found him lying down, and the angels of God were waving\ntheir wings over him, and each of them was saying to the other, “Let me lay my wing\nupon him.”  After this the pagan Barbarians came to the desert of Scete to plunder the\nhouses of the monks, and to slay the monks.  After this Saint Abba John went to the\nmonastery of Saint Abba Anthony in the desert of Kuelzem [by the Red Sea], not that he\nwas afraid of death, but he said, “I go that a pagan may not come and kill me, and go to\nSheol because of me; I do not wish to be in a state of ease and for that pagan to suffer\npunishment on my account.   For he might testify against me before the Lord God,\nthough he is my brother in nature, and form, and likeness.”  And Abba John dwelt by the\nside of a village, and God brought him from it a certain man who was a believer, and he\n\nministered unto him until the time of his death.  When God wished to give him rest from\nthe labor of this world, He sent unto him His righteous saints, Abba Anthony, and Abba\nMacarius, and Abba Pachomius, to comfort him and to inform him concerning his\ndeparture, and there was with them Abba Bamoy, his spiritual father.   And they\ncomforted him and said unto him, “Be strong in the Lord, and rejoice in the everlasting\njoy which God hath prepared.  Be thou ready, for we will come to thee at dawn on the\nFirst Day of the week, and we will take thee with us into everlasting life, even as God\nhath commanded”; and they blessed him and disappeared.  On the day of the Eve of the\nSabbath Saint Abba John sent his attendant to the village, for he was sick with a little\nsickness.  And when it was the time of cock-crow on the night of the holy First Day of\nthe week, behold there came unto him many hosts of angels, and all the company of the\nsaints, and when he saw them he rejoiced and bowed low and delivered up his soul into\nthe hand of God.  And the holy angels received the soul of the blessed Abba John, and\nthey took it up with them into heaven.  And at that moment his attendant came, and he\nsaw his soul as they were carrying it up into heaven, and the holy angels were\nsurrounding it, and were singing before it.   And before all these, as it was shining\nbrightly like the sun, one sang and praised the blessed man Abba John.  And he stood\nstill for the space of an hour as he marveled at what he saw.  And straightway the angel\nof the Lord came unto him and told him the names of each one of the saints, and\npointing with his finger at the saints he said unto [the attendant of] Abba John, “This is\nAbba Pachomius, this is Abba Macarius, this is Abba Bamoy, and this is Abba So-and-\nso.”  And the attendant said unto the angel, “Who is this in front of them who is shining\nlike the sun?”  And the angel said unto him, “This is Abba Anthony, the father of all the\nmonks.”  When the attendant came to the cell he found Abba John on his knees, and he\nwept over him with a great weeping.  And he made haste and went to the village, and\ntold the men how that the saint was dead.  Then the brethren came and made him ready\nfor burial, and they bore away his body with great honor, and when they had brought\nhim into the village, great wonders and miracles happened through his body.  And then\nhis sons, the monks, came and took up his body and they carried it to the desert of Scete\nand laid it in the church thereof, and it became a haven for everyone who took refuge\ntherein.  Salutation to Abba John.\nAnd on this day also died Saint Elisa the prophet, whose name being interpreted is\n“Savior, protector and king.”  This holy man was native of a village the name of which\nwas Be’Elamon, of the tribe of Isaachar, and he prophesied many prophecies concerning\nthe children of Israel.  And he also prophesied saying, “God shall come down upon the\nearth and shall walk with men.”  And he gave a sign of this, saying, “The sun shall set in\nSelom (Silo), and one of its two halves shall be separated from the other, and twelve oak\ntrees shall be useful to the Lord, and submissive to the holy God, Who shall come down\nupon the earth, and by it the whole earth shall be saved.”   When he finished his\nprophecy he died in peace and was buried in his own land.   Salutation to Elisa the\nprophet who made the bitter water sweet and raised the axe out of the water by means of\na splinter of wood.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and they laid it in the sanctuary until they\ncould build a church for it, and translated the body thither.   And they made a great\nfestival in honor thereof on this day.  Salutation to the emperor who translated the body\nof Lazarus to Antioch (sic) from Cyprus.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba John, Archbishop of the holy city of\nJerusalem in the days of the God-loving King David, (A.D. 1411-1413) the grandson of\nthe King Sayf’Ar’Ad.  Now this father was the son of Christian parents, who feared\nGod, and they belonged to the city of Mesr (Cairo); and they reared the holy man\n[piously] and called him John.  When he grew up they taught him Christian doctrine,\nand when he was fit to serve in the grade of deacon he was appointed a deacon.  And\nhaving performed the duties of a deacon well and carefully, and was fit for the grade of\npriest, he was appointed priest.  And he devoted himself strenuously to fasting and to\nprayer, and above all he gave himself to the fear of God and to the love of pilgrims;\nthereupon he became fit for the grade of apostleship.   By the Will of God he was\nappointed bishop in the holy city of Jerusalem, and he fought a good fight therein, and\nhe taught the people in humility and in the fear of God.  And they loved him exceedingly\nbecause of his holiness, and his goodly figure, and his open countenance which was as\nthat of an angel of God.  After he had been seated on his throne for a few years.  Satan\nbrought a trial upon him and removed him from his people and from his city.  And this\nwas in the days when Abba Mark was archbishop of Alexandria.  And the King of Mesr\n(Cairo), a Hanafite, forced him to send an embassy to the King of Ethiopia, who was in\nsubmission to him, concerning the Muslims who dwelt under his rule.  Now there was in\nhis days a king, whose name was Sayf’Ar’Ad, and he was also named Constantine, and\nhe slew many of the Muslims who rebelled against him, and some of them he drove out\nof his country and they went to the King of Mesr (Cairo) and took refuge with him.  And\nthey said, “The King of Ethiopia hath made an end of the Muslims; some of them he\nhath slain, and some of them he hath made Christians.”  When the King of Mesr (Cairo)\nheard thee words, his zeal for his religion rose up, and he compelled the archbishop to\ndispatch elders to [Ethiopia], and he told him that he held him as hostage for the\nobedience of the King of Ethiopia and the safety of the other Muslims who were in his\nkingdom.  And our father the archbishop and his bishops agreed with the Government of\nMesr (Cairo) concerning those who were to be sent to the King of Ethiopia, and they\nchose those fathers, those shining stars, because of their holiness, and learning, and\nwisdom, that is to say the honorable father Abba John, and the learned and prudent\nfather Abba Cyril, Bishop of ‘Akhnas, and he forced them to go to the frontier of\n\nEthiopia, and God-loving King Sayf’Ar’Ad, may God rest his soul!   Amen, heard\nconcerning them, and he rejoiced with exceeding great joy; and he sent his soldiers to\nthem with presents and mules to receive them, and when they had come to the king he\npaid them exceedingly great honor.  And after they had read to him the letter of our\nfather the archbishop, they wished to return to their thrones, and to their peoples, and to\ntheir churches, but the lord king prevented them from departing because he loved their\nholiness, and because he loved their persons, and their priestly service, and their faces\nwhich were full of grace, for they were like unto [those of] the angels of God, and they\nshone like the sun; and the lord king loved them with a great love because of their\nholiness and their prayers.  After a short time God wished, in His mercy, to remove this\nfather Abba John from the labor of this transitory world, and He brought upon him a\nslight illness, and he died at a good old age, now his work was well-pleasing unto God,\nin the eleven hundred and sixth year of the Era of the Righteous Martyrs (A.D. 1390).\nAnd on this day died the great [prophet] Joel.  This righteous man prophesied in the days\nof ‘Abya (Abijah) the son of Jeroboam, the son of Solomon the king.  He taught the\npeople, and admonished them, and prophesied concerning the dwelling of God of Zion,\nand concerning His Passion, and concerning the descent of the Holy Spirit, the\nParaclete, upon the holy Apostles on the day of the festival of Pentecost.   And he\nrevealed that they would prophesy, their daughters, and their sons, and their old men,\nand their young men, and the women who dwelt with them.  “And if there be a prophet\nwho prophesies, I will pour out My Spirit upon all men” (Joel ii. 28); and I will not pour\nexcept [on] the Apostles.  Now of this passage there are two interpretations; I, Because\nthe holy Apostles were perfect in working righteousness he called them “men,” for he\nwho is not perfect among men in doing the good pleasure of God is not called a “man”;\nII, From the Apostles the Holy Spirit was poured out upon all the believing saints from\nthe time of their preaching to the day of the Resurrection.  And this prophet prophesied\nalso concerning the going forth of the Law of the Gospel from Zion, when he said, “A\nstream of water shall flow forth from the house of God, and it shall water the valley of\nShittim” (Joel iii.18).   And he made known that after the coming of our Lord Jesus\nChrist war should break out on the earth, and he spoke also concerning the day of the\nResurrection.  And he said, “The sun shall become dark, and the moon shall become like\nblood, and the light of the stars shall be hidden” (Joel ii. 31).   Now this prophet\nprophesied more than a thousand years before the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.  This\nrighteous man belonged to the tribe of Reuben, and he arrived at a good old age, and he\npleased God and died in peace, and was buried in the fields.   Salutation to Joel the\nprophet, the son of Batuel, whose tongue was sharper than a razor.\nAnd on this day our Lady Mariyam wrought a miracle and delivered Matthias from the\nprison house.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and besides, up to the present none but a virgin hath been appointed to sit\non the throne of Mark the evangelist.”  And these men then joined with them in this\ngood counsel, and they rose up and came into the church, and prayed to God and\nentreated Him to make clear unto them who were the best man for this office.  And\nstraightway God heard their petition, and He made them to remember this Abba\nJoseph, and they sent a letter ordering the monks to bring him from the desert of\nScete.  And those who had been sent prayed unto God and said, “We beseech Thee to\nreveal the matter unto us clearly; if Thou hast chosen this father Abba Joseph to be the\narchbishop, give us the following sign, that is to say, let us find the door of his cell\nopen.”  And when they came to his cell they found the door of his cell open, and they\nfound Abba Joseph bidding farewell to a certain monk, and he was wishing to go into\nhis cell and to shut the door.   When he saw them he embraced them with a holy\nembrace, and received them with joy, and brought them into his house.  When they\ncame into his house they seized him and bound him, saying, “He is worthy, He is\nworthy, Abba Joseph is worthy of the archiepiscopate.”  And he cried out and wept,\nand he said unto them, “I have committed very many sins, far more than any other\nman”; but they would not accept this excuse from him, but they took him to the city\nof Alexandria and appointed him archbishop.  Having taken his seat upon the throne\nof Mark the apostle, he thought about the Church exceedingly, and with what\nremained of his own stipend he bought plots of ground, which had been dedicated to\npious works, and endowed the churches with them.  And he taught the people at all\ntimes, and he never neglected any one of them.  Now, Satan was jealous of him, and\nhe schemed schemes and brought sorrow upon him, and the immediate cause was that\nthe Bishop of the city of Tenes (Tanis), and the Bishop of the city of Mesr (Cairo),\nbehaved wrongly towards the people and oppressed them in the matter of dues and\nafflicted them, and Abba Joseph said unto them, “Forbear and do not afflict them.”\n\nAnd on several occasions he had entreated them to look upon their flocks with the eye\nof mercy, but they would not accept his behests, and they set them aside.  And these\nholy bishops having afflicted their people [to excess], all the people came to the\nArchbishop Abba Joseph, and they all cried out before him, and said unto him, “If\nthou wilt not remove these bishops from over us we shall embrace another Faith.” \nAnd Abba Joseph fought very, very hard to make peace between them, but he was not\nable to do so.  Then he brought all the bishops from all the land of Egypt, and when\nthey were assembled, he told them how these two bishops had afflicted their people. \nAnd the archbishop sent and had those two bishops brought before him, and he\nwished to make peace between them and their people; but they would listen neither to\nhis commands nor to those of his brother bishops.  And straightway the archbishop\nsaid unto them before all the bishops, “I am innocent of your sins,” and the bishops\nwere witnesses against the two bishops that they had transgressed the command of the\nArchbishop Abba Joseph.  And they all wrote with their own hands to this effect; “It is\nmeet for these two bishops to be cut off from their sees” and straightway the\narchbishop cut them from their sees.  And when he had cut them off from their sees,\nthese two bishops went to the King of Egypt, and made false accusations against this\nfather Abba Joseph before him, and the king sent his brother and a company of\nsoldiers to bring the archbishop to him.  When he had come to him the king’s brother\ndrew his sword and wanted to kill him, and when he was about to smite the\narchbishop with the sword, God thrust aside the hand of that nobleman, and his sword\nstruck a pillar, and broke, and he was furiously angry.  And another man drew his\ndagger and drove it into the side of the archbishop with all his might, and his apparel\nand his girdle were cut through, but the dagger did not enter the flesh of the\narchbishop.  Then that nobleman knew that the archbishop was a righteous man, and\nthat there was in him divine grace, which would preserve him from every evil, and\nfrom murder.  And he brought him to the king his brother with great honor, and he\ntold him what he had done to the archbishop, and how he had been smitten twice with\nthe sword and had escaped unhurt.  When the king heard this he marveled, and he was\nafraid of the archbishop and paid him honor, and then he asked him questions about\nthe two bishops who had made accusations against him before him.   And the\narchbishop told him what had happened in the matter of the bishops, and he proved to\nhim that the accusations, which they had made against him, were falsehoods.  And the\nking knew that those bishops were liars, and evil men, and accursed oppressors, and\nstraightway he commanded [his soldiers] to slay them.  And the archbishop said unto\nhim, “Our Lord Christ in the Holy Gospel commanded us to do good in return for\nevil.   These bishops made false accusations against me, but behold, God hath\nestablished it in thy heart that I am innocent of the false charges which they laid\nagainst me to thee; I therefore beseech thee to have mercy upon them, and to forgive\nthem for God’s sake.”  When the king saw the piety of the archbishop, he marveled\nexceedingly, and he paid him honor, and he had mercy upon those two bishops for his\nsake.  And he wrote for him an authorization and gave it to him, and in it he ordered: \n“Neither officials nor bishops shall resist the archbishop, and they shall not disobey\nhis command, and whatsoever he is pleased to do in his see he shall do, whether it be\nto remove a man from his office or to appoint a new one.”  And in the days of this\nfather the King of Ethiopia sent him a letter, saying, “I do homage to the throne of\nMark the evangelist, whereon to sit thou art worthy, and by his grace my kingdom\nhath waxed strong.  I beseech thee to have compassion upon me and to send unto us\nas bishop Abba John.  There are certain men of our city who have gone astray from\nthe light of the throne of Saint Mark the evangelist, and who have set their feet on the\nroad, which is full of thorns, and they have driven out Abba John our bishop.  Because\nof this great tribulation hath come upon our land and all our men are dying of the\nplague, and our beasts and cattle have perished, and God hath restrained the heavens\nso that they cannot rain upon our land, and our enemies have risen up against us and\nhave conquered us, because we have not obeyed the commandments of God.  And\nnow, O holy Abuna, have mercy upon us and upon our folly.  Send us our Bishop\nJohn so that he may entreat God, and pray for us, and deliver us from this tribulation\nthrough thy prayer and his own.  And I will inform thee, O my father, what hath been\n\nthe cause of this.  I thy son was blessed by my father Abba John the bishop, and he\nbade me farewell as he set me on my way with my soldiers, and he blessed me and\nthen returned and dwelt in his diocese.  And we departed to the war, and we continued\nto fight for very many days, and our enemies conquered us, and they destroyed our\nsoldiers, and we took to flight and returned to our own country, and we missed Abba\nJohn our bishop.  And I enquired for him, and they told me that my wife, the queen,\nhad driven him into exile because certain evil men had counseled her to do so, even as\nQueen Eudoxia had in days of old driven John of the Golden Mouth (Chrysostom)\ninto exile, and that they had appointed another bishop who was their choice; they have\ntransgressed the command of the holy Canon, and therefore our country is destroyed. \nAnd now have pity upon us and send Abba John to pray for us.”  Now when they\ndrove that bishop out of Ethiopia he went and dwelt in the monastery wherein he had\nbecome a monk, and that was the monastery of Saint Abba Moses of the desert of\nScete.  When Abba Joseph the archbishop had read the letter of the King of Ethiopia,\nhe rejoiced exceedingly because of his confidence, and he sent quickly to the desert of\nScete and brought back Abba John, and he comforted him, and encouraged him, and\nsent brave men with him to the country of Ethiopia.  As soon as he arrived, the plague\nceased, and rain fell from heaven, and the king rejoiced with very great joy at his\narrival; and this father rebuked the wicked sinners and converted them to the\nOrthodox Faith.   And he likewise encouraged all Christian people in the right and\ngood Faith, which they had received from their fathers.  And he used to interpret for\nthem obscure passages in the Holy Scriptures, and declare their meaning unto them,\nand he preserved them by his teachings and prayers.  And God made manifest through\nthis holy father Abba Joseph great signs and wonders, and having finished his good\nand divine fight, and pleased God, he died in peace, having sat upon the throne of\nMark the evangelist nineteen years.  He lived the life of a monk for nine and thirty\nyears, and he had lived ten years before he adopted the life of a monk; and all the days\nof his life were eight and sixty years.\nAnd on this day also Saint Dionysius, Bishop of the city of Corinth, became a martyr\nin the days of Diocletian and Maximianus, the wicked emperors.  They condemned\nthis holy man to be tortured very severely, and when they were tired of torturing him\nthey cut off his head with a sword, and he received the crown of martyrdom in the\nkingdom of the heavens.\nSalutation to Archbishop Joseph of the city of Manuf, unto whom was given the\nknowledge of Letters.  Salutation to Dionysius the Bishop of Corinth whose head was\ncut off.\nAnd on this day also [are commemorated] the deaths of Tenkeyake (or Tayanke), and\nTheodosius, the Laos (Talawos), Taxis, and Josab (or Joseph), and the strife of\nAndrew, the martyrs.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and since there was a persecution\nin the days of the Emperor Maximianus they continued to fly from city to city.  As they\nlacked a son they entreated God, with fasting and prayer, to give them a son.  And the\nangel of the Lord appeared unto them in a dream, and gave them a vine cluster which\nwas full of grapes, and when the blessed woman conceived, a large tree which was near\ntheir house blossomed, and on the leaves thereof were written in the language of Rome\nthe following words:  “Bula servant of God, and the saint of the God of Jacob, Who\ndwelleth in Zion.”  And when the child was born they left him for some time without\nmaking him a Christian.   Then our Lady Mariyam appeared unto the Archbishop of\nRome, and commanded him to go to the house of Abraham and baptize the child; and\nwhen he arrived there he made him a Christian and called his name “Bula.”  When the\nfather and the mother of the child heard [this] they marveled because he had called the\nchild by that name without their having told him the name.  When the archbishop had\nprayed, bread for the Offering and a cup of wine came down from heaven, and he\nconsecrated them and administered unto them the Holy Mysteries.  When the boy was\none year old he spoke plainly and said, “One is the Holy Father, One is the Holy Son,\nOne is the Holy Ghost.”   After a little [time] his father and his mother died, on the\nsixteenth day of the month of Hedar (Nov-Dec).  When the boy was ten years of age\nthere arrived a wicked governor who ordered [the people] to worship idols, and when\nAbba Bula heard about it, he went to the governor and cursed his filthy idols.  When the\ngovernor saw the small stature of the boy he marveled greatly.  And he commanded [his\nsoldiers] to drive nails into him, and to scrape his body, and to strip off his skin, and to\nsaw off his hands and his feet, and to beat his back with whips, and to cast him on the\nwheel among the sharp knives and spikes, and to drag him along the road of the city;\n[and they did so].  And Saint Michael came and saved him, and healed him.  Then Bula\nwent to another wicked governor and reviled him, and the governor was wroth with him\nand cut off his head with the sword, and he was crowned on the eighteenth day of the\nmonth of Miyazya (April-May).  And Saint Michael came down from heaven and raised\nhim up unharmed, and he took him into the desert, and he arrayed him in the garb of the\nmonk, and put upon him a mark in appearance like the sign of the Cross, and he said\nunto him, “God hath commanded thee to be a companion of the Saints.”  And Abba Bula\nwent up into a dry (i.e., withered) tree, and he dwelt therein fighting incessantly, and\nwhenever he remembered the Crucifixion of our Lord Jesus Christ and His Passion, he\nalways cast himself down from the top of the tree.  One day having cast himself down\nSatan was strong to kill him, and he died, but our Redeemer came straightway and raised\nhim up, and he said unto him, “Thy name shall not be ‘Bula’ only, but ‘ ‘Abibha,’ for\nthou shalt become many fathers.”  And Bula loved Christ more and more, and he was\nalways beating his face, and cutting his flesh with knives, every member of him, and he\nbeat his back with seven hundred stripes; through these acts he died three times and our\nRedeemer raised him up again.  And on each occasion He showed him how he had been\nborn of a virgin, and on other days He showed him how he was seized by the Jews and\nHis Passion.  And for this reason Bula lived without eating and without drinking for two\nand forty years, and he never lay on his side for six and sixty years.  And he also kept his\nhead fixed for twelve years and six months, until his brains perished.  One day when he\nsaw the Passion of our Lord, he place a sword upright before him and then fell upon it\nand died.  And our Lady Mariyam came with angels to the place where his body was,\nand she said unto him, “Peace be unto thee, O my beloved”; and his body spoke and said\n\nunto her, “Peace be unto thee, O Queen of the world.”  And she laid her hands upon his\nbody and healed him.  And when his days were ended, and it was time for him to depart\nfrom this world, our Lord Jesus Christ appeared unto him having in His hands shining\ncrowns set with gems of various kinds, and shining raiment.  And He said unto him,\n“Come unto Me, O My beloved ‘Abib, so that thou mayest enjoy never-ending\npleasure.   I swear unto thee by Myself that whosoever calleth upon thy name I will\nforgive him his sins.  And whosoever commemorates thee, or show mercy on the poor,\nor clothes the naked, or feedeth the hungry, or gives drink to the thirsty man, or buildeth\na shrine for thee, or writes the story of thy strife, or readeth it or heareth it, I will forgive\nhis sins even to the tenth generation.”   Having said this He kissed his mouth, and\nbearing him upon His breast carried him up into the air.  And when he heard the praise\nof the angels, his soul tore itself away from his body, and entered the heavenly\nJerusalem.  Salutation to ‘Abib.\nSalutation to the twelve handmaidens, and to the three and forty men, and to the three\nhundred and sixty women, who under the influence of ‘Abib became martyrs.\nAnd on this day also died Abba ‘Ebloy (Apollo?), who was like the angels.  The name of\nthe father of this holy man Abba ‘Ebloy (Apollo?) was ‘Amone, and he was a native of\nthe city of Akhmim; the name of his mother was Musya.   And both of them were\nrighteous before God, and they walked in His way; and they were very charitable\ntowards pilgrims and strangers.  Now they had no son at all.  And his mother Musya saw\na vision one night, and she saw in it a shining man who had with him a tree, and he\nplanted the tree in her house, and it took root and blossomed and bore fruit.  And the\nshining being said unto her, “Whosoever shall eat of this tree shall live for ever.”  And\nthe mother of the holy man took some of the fruit thereof and ate it, and it was sweet in\nher mouth, and she said in her heart, “Shall I, I wonder, have fruit.”  When she awoke\nfrom her sleep she told her husband what she had seen.  And he told her that he had seen\nin his vision what his wife had seen in her vision, and they praised God many times. \nAnd they added to their works of righteousness and to their strivings, and they fasted for\ntwo days at a time and their food was bread and salt.  When the mother of the holy man\nAbba ‘Ebloy (Apollo?) conceived, she prayed many prayers and vanquished enemies. \nAnd every night she prostrated herself to the ground one thousand times, and every day\nfive hundred times for a period of nine months, until she brought forth her son; and she\ncalled him “ ‘Ebloy (Apollo?).”   After this she added to her works of goodness and\nrighteousness.   When Abba ‘Ebloy (Apollo?) arrived at man’s estate he wished to\nassume the garb of the monk, and he continued to feel this wish until he found the mans\nof gratifying it.  Now he had a friend whose name was ‘Abib, and taking him with him\nthey went forth by night, and they departed and became monks in one of the monasteries\nof Upper Egypt; and they devoted themselves to the ascetic life and fought strenuously. \nAfter a few days ‘Abib died, on the twenty-fifth day of the month Tekemt (Oct-Nov). \nThereupon Saint Abba ‘Ebloy (Apollo?) departed to the monastery of Ablug, and many\nmen were gathered together [there], and he taught them the fear of God and right\nworship.  And on the day of the death of Abba ‘Abib, whilst they were performing the\nservice of commemoration, Abba ‘Ebloy (Apollo?) said unto them, “O brethren,\nwhosoever shall pray this day in the name of Abba ‘Abib God will forgive him his sin,\neven as Christ promised him with this promise, in the following words:  ‘O My chosen\none ‘Abib, whosoever shall pray one prayer on the day of thy commemoration (now\nSaint ‘Abib had said to God, Forgive me all my sin), I will forgive him his sin for thy\nname’s sake.’ “  And it came to pass in that hour that one of the monks died, and whilst\nthey were standing and were burying him, one of the brethren who were monks felt\ndoubts about what Abba ‘Ebloy (Apollo?) said.  And straightway that dead man rose up,\nand he began to speak and to say unto them,  “Why do ye doubt the words of Abba\n‘Ebloy (Apollo?)?  God did covenant this covenant with our father Abba ‘Abib on the\nday of his commemoration”; when the dead man had said these words he turned and lay\ndown again.   And the brethren, the monks, marveled and praised God.   Now Abba\n‘Ebloy (Apollo?) lived very many years, and he built many monasteries, and had many\nchildren; and in his days lived Abba Macarius the Great.  When Abba Macarius heard\n\nthe report of him he rejoiced therein exceedingly, and he wrote to him letters comforting\nhim and his sons, the monks, and encouraging him to continue in the work, which was\nwell pleasing to God.  Now whilst Abba Macarius was writing those letters in the desert\nof Scete, Abba ‘Ebloy (Apollo?), being in Upper Egypt, knew by the Holy Spirit that he\nwas doing so.  And he said unto the monks who were round about him, speaking unto\nthem with the voice of God, “Be silent, O my brethren, for behold Abba Macarius is\nwriting to us a letter of encouragement.”  Having spoken these words in this manner,\nbehold, straightway a certain monk came having with him the letter of Abba Macarius. \nAnd the monks went out and they received him with joy, and he read the letter before all\nthe monks with joy and they rejoiced with a great joy.   This holy man Abba ‘Ebloy\n(Apollo?) went to the holy father Abba Ammonius, and he saw that holy woman, whose\nname was Yawahit, dwelling with him.  And Christ having wished to give him rest from\nthe labor of this world, he died straightway in peace on the fifth day of the month of\nYakatit (Feb-Mar).  Now we have written the history of Abba ‘Ebloy (Apollo?) side by\nside with that of his friend Abba ‘Abib.\nAnd on this day also took place the consecration of the church of Saint Julius the martyr,\nof the city of ‘Akpahos (Acfaha).  Now the saint became a martyr in the city of Tewa,\naccording to what is written in the account of his strife.  And this took place after the\ndestruction of Diocletian the infidel, when Constantine was reigning, and a few days\nbefore he was baptized with Christian baptism.  And when he had been baptized the\nhorn of the Christian kingdom was exalted, and churches were built in the names of the\nholy martyrs whom the infidel emperors had slain.   When the Emperor Constantine\nheard the report of this holy man Julius, and how God had raised him up and preserved\nhim so that he might care for the bodies of the holy martyrs, both him and his servants,\nand carry their bodies and bury them, and write the history of their strifes, and how he\nbecame a martyr afterwards, he praised [God] for this holy man, for his fight was good. \nAnd the emperor sent very much money to Egypt, and he commanded [the people] to\nbuild a fine church in his honor, and to carry his body thither and to lay it therein; and\nthey built a fine church in his honor even as the emperor commanded, and they\ntranslated the body of Saint Julius and laid it therein.  And the Archbishop of Alexandria\nand his bishops consecrated it, and celebrated a festival even as do we this day.  And\nmany great signs and wonders were wrought by the body of Saint Julius.  Salutation to\nthe consecration of thy church, O Julius.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Abba ‘Abel and Dalila (Delilah), the virgin.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and he went forth from Harran as God\ncommanded.”  And again God commanded him to speak, and then Stephen talked to them\nabout the birth of Isaac, and concerning Jacob and his sons, how they sold Joseph, and\nhow Joseph knew his brethren when he was chief.  And Saint Stephen talked with them\nuntil [he came to] the building of the sanctuary.  And then he lifted up his voice and said\nunto them, “O ye stiff-necked men, ye dense of heart, at all time do ye resist the Holy\nSpirit, even as did your fathers who persecuted the prophets who prophesied, and who\npreached concerning Christ, Whom ye killed, and Who hath risen from the dead.”  And\nwhen they heard this they gnashed their teeth upon him.  And Saint Stephen being full of\nfaith, and of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven, and he saw the glory of god, and Jesus\nChrist at the right hand of God His Father, and he said unto them, “Behold, I see heaven\nopen, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God His Father.”  And when they heard\n[this] they shut their ears, and took him that they might stone him with stones, and they\ndeposited their apparel with Saul, that is to say Paul.  And they took Stephen outside the\ncity, and stoned him, and he prayed to God on their behalf, and he knelt down on his\nknees and said, “Receive my soul unto Thyself, O God.”  And he said, “Let not this sin be\nreckoned unto them”; and he was like unto his Lord.  And when he had said this he died,\nand certain believing men came and carried away the body of the saint, and they lamented\nfor him with a great lamentation, and buried him.  Salutation to Stephen.\nAnd on this day also Saint Lavendius (Leontius) became a martyr.  This saint lived in the\ndays of the Emperor Maximianus, the infidel, in the country of Syria.  When the Emperor\nheard about him, and knew that he was a fighter of the spiritual fight, and that he\nworshipped God, he sent and had him brought before him.  And he offered him very much\nmoney, and tried to persuade him to forsake the worship of God, and to serve his idols. \nAnd Saint Lavendius (Leontius) laughed at him and spurned his gifts, and his money, and\nhis honors, and despised his punishments, and cursed his unclean gods.  And straightway\nthe Emperor was wroth exceedingly, and he commanded his soldiers to hang him up on\nthe wheel, and to torture him severely; and they did to him as the emperor commanded,\nbut God brought him out sound and uninjured.  Then the emperor commanded them to\nbeat him with clubs, and to boil oil and fat in a large cauldron, and to cast the saint into it;\nand they did this to him.  And the saint endured all these tortures, for our Lord Christ\nmake him strong, and enabled him to endure, and He raised him up whole and uninjured. \nWhen the emperor was tired of torturing him, he commanded them to cut off his head with\nthe sword, and thus he received a crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens. \nAnd many signs and wonders were made manifest through his body, and the fame of him\nwas heard throughout Syria; and they built churches and monasteries in his honor.  In one\n\nof his monasteries Saint Severus, Archbishop of the city of Antioch, was baptized when he\nwas a child.  Salutation to Lavendius (Leontius).\nAnd on this day also died Saint Macarius, the sixty-first Archbishop of the city of\nAlexandria.  When Abba Michael, the Archbishop, his predecessor, died, the bishops, and\nchief priests, and elders of Egypt, gathered together, and they all went up to the desert of\nScete, and they took up their abode in the monastery of Saint Abba Macarius, and they\nenquired carefully of the desert monks, and the righteous men who dwelt in cells and\ncaves, and asked them who was fit for the honorable office of archbishop; and one of the\nrighteous men told them about this saint.   And the priest Macarius, who dwelt in the\nmonastery of Saint Abba Macarius, said, “He is better than all others for this office”; and\nthey searched for him, and seized him against his will, and as they bound him, he cried out\n“I am a sinner and am not fit for this work”; but they did not hearken to his words, and\nthey made him archbishop against his will.     And he appointed bishops and priests in\nevery district of Egypt, and he restored many churches, and in his days all Christians lived\nin peace and safety, for twenty-seven years and thirty-one days, and he was well pleasing\nto God, and died in peace.  Salutation to Macarius.\nAnd on this day the saints of Akmim became martyrs, and their history is as follows: \nThere was a certain man of the men of Akmim who was a judge, and he was rich in gold\nand silver, and his name was El-Sidmalyos, and he begot two sons whose names were\nDioscurus and Saklabius (Aesculapius), and they were reared in the fear of God, with\nfasting and prayer.  And when their father died they wished to adopt the monastic life; and\nthe angel of God appeared unto them and [commanded] them to go to the monastery of\nAbba Moses, the desert monk; and having gone to him they put on the garb of the monk,\nand they fought the spiritual fight strenuously, and performed signs and wonders.  And\nafter a few [days] Dioscurus was made a deacon [and] priest, and Saklabius a deacon, and\nthen it happened that Diocletian denied the God of heaven, and commanded Arianus, the\ngovernor of Ensena (Esneh) to slay [all] the Christians who would not sacrifice to his\ngods.  And Arianus arrived in Akmim and he seized Peter, the bishop, Abba Bunudyas,\nand he bound him, and came into his city.  And Michael, the angel of God, appeared unto\nDioscurus and Saklabius, and told them that they were to receive the crown of martyrdom\nin the kingdom of the heavens, and on the twenty-eighth day of the month of Tahsas they\nand twenty-four monks went to Arianus.  And when they arrived in the city of ‘Akmim\nthey found the Christians, together with their wives and children, in the church of Christ\nour Redeemer, ready to celebrate the festival of the Glorious Birth and to die for His\nName; and Abba Benudyas (sic) the bishop came with them.   And on the following\nmorning Abba Benudyas read the Liturgy, and when he came to the passage wherein is\nsaid “Holy,” the angels cried out, saying, “Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hosts, Heaven\nand earth are full of Thy glory.”  And the saints saw our Redeemer sitting upon the Tabot\n(tabernacle) and the angels standing round Him raising the Offering, and He placed the\nOffering in the hand of the priest that he might present it to those assembled there.  When\nArianus heard [this] he was filled with great wrath, and he came into the church, and\nseized the two elders of the city whose names were Behwafa and Wenin, and cut off their\nheads with the sword.  And after that he killed the deacons, and the sub deacons, and the\nsingers, and the steward of the church, and he left neither woman nor child alive; and at\nlength their blood ran out of the door of the church, and flowed down the road for a\ndistance of twenty cubits.  Then [the officer] took Abba Bunudyas (sic) the bishop, and\nDioscurus and Saklabius, and the brethren who were with them, and carried them before\nArianus, who persuaded them to worship idols.   And when they refused to do so, he\ncommanded soldiers to beat Dioscurus and Saklabius until their bones were shattered,\n[and they did so], but the angel of God appeared unto the saints, and healed them.  And\nKaryon and Philemon, the chief officers of the guard of Arianus, and the forty soldiers\nwho were with them, saw this miracle, and they believed on Jesus Christ.   And the\ngovernor commanded his soldiers to cast them into a red-hot oven, and they finished their\nmartyrdom on the thirtieth day of the month of Tahsas.  And several of those who were\ngathered together there cast themselves into the oven, without any man compelling them\nto do so, and they finished their martyrdom.  And on the first day of the month Ter, whilst\n\nDioscurus and Saklabius were shut up in prison, Michael the Archangel appeared unto\nthem and made them strong to finish their martyrdom.  And on the following day Arianus\nheld converse with them concerning their worshipping idols, and when they refused to do\nso, he commanded the soldiers to gouge out the eyes of Dioscurus, and the saint took up\nhis eyes and put them back in their sockets, and they were as they had been before [they\nwere gouged out].  And Lucius, an officer, and his company of soldiers believed in Christ,\nand the governor cast them into a pit, and they completed their martyrdom.  And then\nArianus commanded the soldiers to kill the saints, and whilst they were praying the Lord\nJesus Christ appeared unto them and gave them the covenant that whosoever invoked their\nnames, and commemorated them, and wrote a history of their strife should be numbered\nwith the company of the righteous.  Then the soldiers came and cut off the head of Saint\nDioscurus with the sword, and Saklabius they cut in halves, and the four and twenty\nmonks they split in twain, from their heads to their feet, and they were crowned on the\nfirst day of the month Ter.   And Samuel, who was a kinsman of theirs, swathed their\nbodies for burial, and he buried them in the church, which was consecrated in the Name of\nthe Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost.  And the number of the martyrs who were\nslain is eight thousand one hundred and forty.  Salutation to Dioscurus and Saklabius.\nAnd on this day also became martyrs, excepting those who died the day before, whom\nDiocletian killed, sixty priests, one hundred and thirty deacons, fifty-three singers, eighty\nstewards (i.e. vergers) of churches, forty-two judges, one hundred and fifty sub deacons,\neight thousand four hundred and ninety members of the laity, and their elders Ledianus\n(Lydianus), and Tadres (Theodore), and Paul.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

And when he had gone down into the valley\nSatan visited Cain, and he said unto him, “Why art thou sorrowful?”  And Cain said unto\nhim, “Because my father hath commanded me to give my beautiful sister to my brother\nAbel.” And Satan said unto him, “Hear my voice, O my friend, and listen to my\nadmonition.  Rise up and follow thy brother, and thou wilt find him drinking water; smite\nhim on his head with a stone, and when he dieth thou canst marry both thy sisters.”  And\nthe advice of Satan was good in Cain’s sight, and he burned with the lust for fornication,\nfor he was the son of perdition.  And then he took up a stone and smote the head of Abel,\nwho died by the hand of his brother through jealousy of a woman.  This was the beginning\nof sorrow, and the cause of death in the world.  And concerning this God said unto Adam\nand Eve when they were in the Garden, “Ye shall not eat of this tree, for in the day\nwherein ye eat thereof ye shall surely die” (Gen. ii, 17); and these words referred to Abel\nbefore [he was born].  And God said unto Cain, “Where is thy brother Abel?”  And Cain\nsaid unto Him, “Am I my brother Abel’s keeper?”  And God said unto him, “The blood of\nthy brother hath come to Me.   Cursed shall the earth be because she hath opened her\nmouth to drink the blood of thy brother; and do thou tremble, and be terrified all the days\nof thy life.”  And this curse was exceedingly heavy upon Cain, and at length his seed was\ndestroyed from off the face of the earth by the waters of the Flood, because of Abel.  And\nEnoch saith, “I heard the blood of Abel crying out, and accusing his brother.”  And our\nparents, the children of Adam, before the waters of the Flood, used to swear by the blood\nof Abel, and our Lord said unto the scribes and Pharisees, “Which of the prophets did not\nyour fathers kill?  Therefore there cometh upon you the blood of all the righteous which\nhath been poured out upon the ground from the blood of Abel the Just to the blood of\nZachariah the priest, the son of Berachiah, whom they slew in the midst of the sanctuary”\n(Matthew xxiii, 35).  And Paul saith, “The sacrifice of Abel was better than [that of] Cain,\n\nby reason of the faith which he brought to God, and it became a witness concerning him\nthat he was a righteous man, and the sacrifice which he offered to God also testified\nconcerning him; and [although] he is dead it yet speaketh.”  And he saith also, “Jesus, the\nlamp and guide of the new covenant, and the sprinkling of the blood of the prophet, which\nspeaketh better than that of Abel” (Hebrews xi, 4; xii, 24).  And then, when Adam missed\nAbel, his son, he said unto Cain, “Where is thy brother?”  And Cain answered him angrily,\nsaying, “How should I know where by brother is?”  And Adam ran into the valley and\nfound Abel, and he took Abel’s head in his arms, and said unto him, “Who killed thee?”\nand Abel said, “Cain killed me.”  And Adam and his wife wept for Abel for four weeks of\nyears.  And as soon as Abel was dead angels came to Adam and said unto him, “Good\ntidings for thee, O father of the world!  Thy son Abel reposeth in peace among the trees of\nthy Garden, and his soul hath ascended to God as a sacrifice, which hath been accepted. \nAs thou wast the first to [bring in] death, so he is the first to enter into the holy place.” \nWhen Adam heard this he was comforted and he buried Abel in the Cave of Treasures. \nSalutation to Abel the accepted sacrifice.\nAnd on this day also Hellanicus, the bishop [of Weshim], became a martyr.  When the\nEmperor Diocletian, the infidel, heard the report that Saint Hellanicus was teaching the\npeople to reject his gods, he sent envoys to seize him, and to torture him severely.  And\nwhen the blessed Hellanicus heard of the arrival of the envoys of the emperor, he gathered\ntogether the people who were in his city Weshim, and he consecrated the Offering, and\nadministered unto them the Holy Mysteries, the Body and Blood of Christ, and then he\nsaid unto them, “After this time ye will never again see my face.”  And they all wept with\na bitter weeping, and they were unable to hold him back against his will.  Then he went\nout and delivered himself up to the envoys of the emperor, and they took him and gave\nhim to the governor of Antinoe to torture.  And the governor tortured him severely, and\nGod gave him strength and enabled him to endure the torture; and then the governor took\nhim with him to the city of Edku and there also he tortured him severely.  And when he\nwas tired of torturing him he commanded the soldiers to cut off his head with the sword,\nand to cut through his body to the shoulders; and they cut through his head down to the\nshoulders; and the governor took him with him to carry him to the city of Tukh.  And as\nthey were traveling in the boat, the saint, knowing that his death was near, commanded\none of the sailors, who was a believer, saying, “When we arrive at the port (or quay) and I\nam dead, cast out my body on a hill”; and having said this he died.  And they arrived in\nport, and straightway the sailor took the body of the saint and cast it out on a hill.  And\nimmediately certain believers, who had been commanded to do so by the angel of God,\ncame and took his holy body, and swathed it for burial, and hid it among them until the\nend of the days of persecution.  And they built a church, and laid his body therein, and\ngreat signs and miracles took place [therein] through it.  Salutation to Hellanicus whose\nshoulders were cut through.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Theonas, the sixteenth Archbishop of the city of\nAlexandria.  This saint was learned, and wise, and strong in the True Faith, and good in\nevery action of his life; and all men loved him because of his learning and wisdom.  And\nhe built in the city of Alexandria the church of our holy Lady the Virgin Mary; [until that\ntime] the Christians and the believers were only able to pray and to receive the Eucharist\nin cells (or caves) secretly because of their fear of the infidels.  And this saint persuaded\nthe people until they let him build beautiful churches, and he converted many of them, and\nbaptized them with Christian baptism.   At the end of the [last] year of his office he\nbaptized the blessed Peter, who became archbishop after him; in the fifth year of his office\nhe made him a reader, in the twelfth year of his office he made him a deacon, and in the\nsixteenth year of his office he made him a priest.  In the days of this saint there appeared\nin the city of Alexandria the infidel Sabelus, who believed and said that Father, Son and\nHoly Spirit are one Person; and this father anathematized him and brought his evil faith to\nnaught.  And in his days Cosmas, and Damianus, and their mother suffered martyrdom. \nAnd this father finished a good life, and pleased God, and having sat for eight and twenty\nyears he died in peace.  Salutation to Theonas, who baptized Peter.\n\nAnd on this day was consecrated the church of our holy Lady the Virgin Mary, in the\nmonastery of Abba Sinoda.  Salutation to the consecration of thy church, O Mary.\nAnd on this day also nine thousand seven hundred souls became martyrs with Philotheus,\nand Sabela the daughter of Hercules, the interpreter of dreams.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

but then he received from our\nLord power and consolation.  And he went forth to the country, which was his lot, and with\nhim was his disciple Prochorus.  They embarked in a ship, and intended to go to the city of\nthe Ephesians, but the ship was wrecked, and each man clung to a plank of wood from the\nship.  And the waves of the sea washed Prochorus, his disciple, to an island, but Saint John\nremained among the waves of the sea for forty days and forty nights.   At length God\ncommanded, and the sea carried him to the place where his disciple Prochorus was living,\nand he gave thanks to God that they had met again.  And they rose up and went into the city\nof the Ephesians, but they were unable to preach in the Name of our Lord Christ, because the\nmen there were wicked, and perverse, and invented pretexts [to harm them].   And John\nbecame the furnace-man, and tended the fire of the bath of a woman whose name was\nRomna, and Prochorus, his disciple, became a washer of clothes.  And the mistress of the\nbath afflicted them sorely, and treated them with cruelty, and contumely, and she used to beat\nthem with sticks and curse them with many, many curses because of their alien origin and\npoverty.  And she treated them as her slaves, and she wrote labels whereon their prices for\nsale were written, and attached them to their persons.  And they remained with her in great\nwretchedness until the son of the governor of the city came into the bath to wash.  Now there\nhad been in the bathhouse a power of the Satans from the time when it was built, and this\npower strangled the son of the governor, and he died straightway.  And when the men of the\ncity gathered together to see the young man who had died, Saint John came with them, and\nhe stood still and looked on like everyone else.  And when Romna saw him, she cursed him\nand said, “Hast thou come hither to laugh at me, and to rejoice thyself over the death of the\nson of my lord?”  And the saint answered her gently, and said unto her, “Fear not, neither be\nthou sorrowful”; and he drew nigh unto the dead man, and made the sign of the Life-giving\nCross over him, and he breathed on his face, and the young man came to life again\nstraightway.  And the men of the city cried out, and came to worship Saint John, and first and\nforemost among them was his mistress Romna; and she was weeping, and beseeching him to\nforgive her all the faults, which she had committed against him.  And when Dioscorides the\ngovernor heard that his son was dead, he was smitten with fear and died; and when they told\nJohn this, he made the sign of the Cross over him, and raised him up from the dead.  And he\nbelieved on Jesus Christ, and was baptized with all the men of his house in the Name of the\nFather and the Son and the Holy Spirit.  And when John reviled the men of the Ephesians\nbecause of their worship of idols, anger seized them, and they stoned him with stones, but the\nstones came back and broke their idols.   And when they prayed to their god there was a\nnoise, and an earthquake took place, and three hundred men died; but Saint John prayed and\nraised them up from the dead.  And the men of the city believed, and were baptized in the\nName of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.  And a certain woman whose son had\nbeen seized by an unclean spirit, came to him, and asked him [to help her], and he took the\nright hand of the young man and made the sign of the Cross over him, and he rose up, being\nfreed from the unclean spirit, and he glorified God.  And there was another man who had lain\nupon a bed for twelve years, and when he saw John he cried out with a loud voice, saying,\n“Have mercy upon me, O apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ.”   And when John saw his\nconfidence, he said unto him, “In the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ rise up”; and the man\nrose up quickly, and believed on Christ.  And when Satan saw all these signs and wonders he\nwas filled with craftiness and envy, and he took the form of a soldier of the emperor, and\ncame into the city weeping.  And two men who were passing by found him, and they said\nunto him, “Why dost thou weep?”  And he said unto them, “The emperor hath given me two\n\nmen who are magicians, and whose names are John and Prochorus; if ye can seize them for\nme I will give you gold.”  And straightway the two men seized John and Prochorus, and\nwanted to kill them secretly, but when Dioscorides the governor heard of this he delivered\nthem.  And John performed many signs and wonders before them, and all the men of the city\nbelieved on our Lord Jesus Christ, except the priests of the idols, and they did not believe\nand they wanted to kill Saint John.  And Satan stirred them up against him to kill him, but\nGod Who protecteth His chosen ones [saved him].  And Saint John labored hard and suffered\ngreat tribulation until at length he converted them all to the knowledge of God.  And the\napostle Saint Paul is a witness concerning them, and concerning the denseness of heart of the\nmen of Ephesus, and concerning their excessive love for idols.  And with great toil Saint\nJohn brought them all into the True Faith, and he set over them a bishop, and priests, and\ndeacons.  And he went forth to all the cities, and traveled through all the country of Asia, and\nhe converted all the people and brought them into the knowledge of God.  And the blessed\nJohn lived ninety years, and grew very old, and he did not taste death by the sword like all\nthe [other] apostles, but because of his virginity and purity they are all equally to be praised. \nAnd he wrote a Gospel and ‘Abukalamsis (the Apocalypse) which he saw in the island of\nPatmo (Patmos), which is full of mysteries.  And he wrote three Letters, which are written in\nthe Book of the Apostle, and it was he who reclined on the breast of our Lord at the time of\nthe Supper, and he said unto Him, “My Lord, who is he that shall betray Thee?”  And it is he\nwho, at the time of the Crucifixion of our Redeemer, stood with our holy Lady, the Virgin\nMary; and our Lord said unto the Virgin, “Behold thy son,” and to that disciple He said,\n“Behold thy mother.”  And he it was of whom Peter spoke when he said, “And this one, what\nof him?”  And our Lord said unto him, “If it be that I wish him to be [here] until I come, what\nis that to thee?”  And when the blessed John knew that the time of his departure from this\nworld was nigh, he summoned the people, and he brake bread, which is the Body and Blood\nof Christ, and gave it to them so that they might be strong in the True Faith; and he\ncomforted them and blessed them.  And he then commanded his disciple Prochorus, and\nsome of the other brethren to take digging tools, and to follow him.  And he went a short\ndistance outside the city of Ephesus, and he commanded them to dig a pit, [and they did so],\nand he went down into it and stripped off his apparel, leaving upon him only a tunic and a\nnapkin; and he lifted up his hands and prayed.  And he bade the brethren farewell, and sent\nthem away to return to the city, and he told the brethren to be strong in the Faith of Christ,\nand to do good works, because God would assuredly reward each and every man according\nto his work.  And he also said unto them, “I am innocent of your blood, for I have never\nomitted to tell you of the least of God’s commandments, and there is no ordinance of His\nwhich I have not told you.  After this time ye shall never again see my face.”  And when he\nsaid this they wept and they kissed his hands and his feet, and left him in the pit and\ndeparted; and the saint knelt down upon his knees and prayed.  When the people knew of this\ntheir hearts burned and they were exceedingly sorry, and they all went out, but they could not\nfind his grave, only his sandals and a garment; and they glorified God Who had made His\ndisciple to rest in this splendid manner, and they marveled at His work.  Salutation to John.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated George, and Matena the Archbishop, and Theodora\nthe martyr, and Abba Likanos, and Abba Nardos of Dabra Bizan, who killed a serpent by\nmeans of his prayer and did not smite it with a stick, and who stood up in prayer until his feet\ndecayed.\nSalutation to Sabela (Sybil), the interpretress of the dreams of the nine wise men of Rome,\nwhen they made them known unto her.  [Wanting in the Bodleian MS.]\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

for there was no one else in Constantine’s army who dared to mention the\nName of Christ except this holy man.  And when Constantine had conquered his enemies by\nthe sign of the Honorable Cross, he became a Christian in truth, and he lifted up the horn of\nthe Christians and of their Faith.  And this soldier lived on after Constantine, and after the\nson of Constantine, until the days of Julian the infidel, and at that time his days were one\nhundred and ten years.  And one day when he was walking about in the open places of the\ncity of Antioch, he found two men fighting together, and he wanted to separate them and to\nmake peace between them; now he was an old man who was held in honor, and he made joy\nand peace to be between them.   And a certain man went to the emperor and made an\naccusation against this holy man, and he said unto him, “Eusegnius hath become a judge and\ngovernor of his own free will.”  And the emperor had this saint brought before him; and he\nrebuked him and said unto him, “Who hath appointed thee [a judge and governor?”  And\nSaint Eusegnius answered and said unto him], “Why hast thou forsaken the worship of God,\nthe God of heaven, in Whose hand is thy soul, and dost bow down to unclean idols, and dost\nnot follow the kings who were before thee?  I was a soldier under Constantine like thee, for\ntwenty years, and also under his son, and neither of them had the evil habit which thou hast;\nfor thou hast forsaken God and dost worship unclean idols.”   And the emperor was\nexceedingly worth with him, and he commanded his soldiers to hang him up, and to apply\nlighted torches to his sides; and they did all these things, but the saint endured them all\nthrough the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ.  And when the emperor was tired of torturing\nhim, he commanded them to cut off his head with the sword.  And when the soldiers arrived\nto cut off his head, he begged them to wait whilst he prayed, and when he had finished his\nprayer they cut off his honorable head, and he received the crown of martyrdom in the\nkingdom of the heavens together with all the saints.  Salutation to Eusegnius, who interpreted\nthe mystery of the Cross to the Emperor Constantine.\nAnd on this day also died Abba Matthew, the eighty-eighth Archbishop of the city of\nAlexandria.  This father Matthew had parents of the race of Israel, who believed in Christ\nand were perfect in good works.  The name of his father was Simon and the name of his\nmother was Barbara, and God gave them two children, and the name of the elder was Jacob\nand the name of the younger was Matthew.   And whilst this Abba Matthew was in his\nmother’s womb, Abba Peter, Bishop of the city of Abures, met her, and when he saw her he\ngot off his donkey and kissed her belly, and said unto her, “Blessed art thou, O woman, and\nblessed is the fruit of thy belly.  Behold there shall go forth from thee a bright star who shall\nshine in his preaching like Mark the evangelist.”  When Abba Matthew was fifteen years old\nhis father died, and then he went to Abba ‘Abrem, and Komos of the monastery of Saint\n‘Abufana, and he asked him to array him in the garb of the ascetic life; and the abbot said\nunto him, “Obtain the consent of thy brother, who is older than thou art, and come back.” \nWhen Abba Matthew heard this he went back in sorrow of heart, and on the way the angel\nMichael, who was in the form of a monk, met him, and told him that he should become\nArchbishop [of Alexandria], and that signs and wonders should be wrought through him. \nAnd having come to his brother, he urged him to let him become a monk, and when he\nrefused Abba Matthew went to the monastery of Saint Abba ‘Amoni, of the monastery of\nTona, and took refuge in the church.  And when the brethren had entreated his brother, he\n\nallowed him [to become a monk], and he went to the monastery of Saint Abba ‘Abufana, and\nAbba ‘Abrem made him a monk; and he fought the spiritual fight with fasting and prayer\nuntil he attained the power of the monks.  And after a year Abba Peter went out to Abba\n‘Abrem, and he saw Abba Matthew, and his patience and his prudence, and he asked Abba\n‘Abrem to give him to him so that he might be his disciple.  And the bishop took him with\nhim against his will, and he dwelt with him, and he kept vigil all night long from the time of\nsunset to sunrise.  And when it was eighteen years since he was born, the bishop took him\nand made him a priest against his will.  And when Satan observed his vigils he entered into\nthe heart of a certain beautiful woman, who showed him her person, and solicited him with\nevil desire; and Abba Matthew seeing her prayed to God with tears, and even asked for\ndeath.  Then he went in to the bishop and entreated him to send him away to his monastery. \nAnd when the bishop prevented him he came into the Episcopal treasury and took a priestly\nvestment of great price, which belonged to the bishop, and he slit it into strips, every part of\nit, with a razor, and then he restored it to its former place.  And on the following day the\nbishop said unto Abba Matthew, “Bring me the priestly vestment, for I must officiate at the\nEucharist this day”; and when he brought it to him, it fell down before him like wooden\nshavings.  When the bishop saw this he was very wroth, and he said, “Who hath done this\nthing?”  And Abba Matthew said, “I did it, because thou didst prevent me from going away. \nIs doing this a greater sin than falling into fornication?”  And the bishop sent him away in\nwrath, and he wrote an order of excommunication concerning him to the men of the\nmonastery, ordering that he should perform two hundred prostrations each night and day, and\nthat he should dwell neither in a cell nor in a house, but in the church at the time of prayer;\nand Abba Matthew fought this spiritual fight for two years.  When the bishop heard of his\npatient endurance he sent him his blessing and removed the ban of excommunication.  And\nthen his brother Jacob came to him, and became a monk, and he fought until he had\nconquered Satan.  And then Abba Matthew went to the monastery of Abba Anthony, and he\ndwelt there, fighting strenuously.  And there was there a certain righteous monk whose name\nwas Jacob, and he saw a vision in which it seemed that a shining angel came unto Abba\nMatthew, and embraced him, and gave keys into his hands.  And when Abba Jacob awoke he\ntold this to Abba Matthew who straightway, because he hated empty praise, wandered round\nthe country from city to city.  One day whilst Abba Matthew was officiating in the office of\nthe Eucharist, he saw our Lord Christ sitting upon the altar, and He lay in the paten like a\nlittle child.  And at the time when he broke the Offering, he stood up for a long time with his\nhands stretched out and covered with blood, and he continued to weep abundantly, and he\nwas afraid:  and he told this vision to no man.  And his teacher saw him and he marveled at\nhis standing still so long a time, and then he prayed to God to reveal to him this matter.  One\nday when they were consecrating the Offering as usual, our Lord Jesus Christ appeared unto\nthem, lying upon the paten in the form of a child, and He was broken up by the hand of Abba\nMatthew like bread.  And straightway he marveled and said, “Glory be to Thee, O God, Who\nhast given unto us sons of men this great gift.”  When Abba Matthew saw this he fetched\nsome iron nails, and drove them into his knee every Friday until a worm came out there\nfrom.   Thence he departed to Dabra Kueskuam, and he dwelt there, and he fought so\nstrenuously that at length when he gazed upwards he could see our Lord Jesus Christ sitting\non the right hand of His Father; and when he looked downwards he saw Him in the abysses\nin great glory.  When Abba Gabriel the archbishop died they (i.e. the bishops and priests)\nappointed Abba Matthew to succeed him as archbishop against his will, and when he refused\nthey set guards over him, and the following day all the bishops told him that they had seen a\nvision and that he was suitable for the office of archbishop.  When Abba Matthew heard this\nhe knew that they would not let him go, and he took a razor secretly and drew it across his\ntongue and cut if off.  And that night our Lady Mary came to him, and anointed his tongue\nwith oil, and healed it, and it became as it was before [he cut it].  And they took him to the\ncity of Alexandria, and when they were enthroning him on the sixteenth day of the month\nNahase (Aug.-Sept.), the day of the festival of the death of our Lady Mary, a voice was heard\nfrom heaven, saying, “He is worthy, He is worthy, He is worthy.”  And they brought the head\nof Mark the evangelist that they might lay it in his breast, and the head flew up and kissed his\nmouth.  And from that time he never sat upon his throne at the time of the Offering, and he\nnever entered into the house of any man on the Fourth and Sixth Days of the week.  And he\nprophesied that David (i.e. David I, who was abdicated A.D. 1411, and died 6th Oct. 1413)\n\nwould reign as King of Ethiopia though his brother Wedem ‘Asfare (or Germa ‘Asfare, who\nreigned till 1382) was reigning.  And this father performed many miracles in his days, and he\nhealed the sick, and raised the dead by the bandlet, which was on his head.  And in his days\nthere was appointed a deputy governor over Mesr (Cairo) who was a wicked man, and he\nimposed a tax on the archbishop to which he had never been submitted before; and when he\nrefused to pay it he beat the archbishop severely, and carried him into his habitation.  That\nnight Abba Matthew entreated our Lady Mary to received his soul from the torment of this\nworld, and she appeared unto him, and held converse with him, saying, “Be not sorrowful;\nafter eight days thou shalt rest.”  And on the following day Abba Matthew called the bishops,\nand priests, and deacons, and all the people, and he told them about his [coming] death, and\nhe exhorted them about the word of the Faith and blessed them.   And when his sickness\nincreased he took a picture of our Lady Mary, and prayed a long time, and he kissed the\npicture and made the sign of the Cross over his face, and he blessed all the people of the city\nwho believed in Christ, and he died on the First Day of the week.   Salutation to Abba\nMatthew, the doubly blessed.\nAnd on this day also became martyrs Yarewenyos, and many men and women, and Negirus\n(Longinus) of Rome, Alexandra who visited Arsenius, and ‘Awshia.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

now many\nhave imagined that our Lord Christ did not enter the chamber of circumcision, and that He\nwas not circumcised.  If it was as these people thought, would not the Jews have found in\n[His uncircumcision] a greater pretext than that which they put forward [for attacking Him]. \nAnd the Holy Gospel saith, “The Jews searched for men who would bear false witness\nagainst Him, and they found them not.”  Our Lord Christ fulfilled all the Laws of Moses, and\ncame into the chamber of circumcision according to the Laws of the Torah.  And for us He\nhath ordained in its place Christian baptism and the eating of unleavened bread, and for us\nHe hath ordained in its place His Holy Body and Honorable Blood, and the abrogation of the\nSabbath of the Jews, and for us He hath ordained in its place the First Day of the week,\nwhich is the Day of His Holy Resurrection.  And when eight days had passed since our Lord\nChrist was born, that is to say when it was the sixth day of the month of Ter, Mary the pure\nVirgin said unto Joseph, the just man, “Go and bring me a skilful circumciser that he may\ncircumcise my Son according to the Law of Moses, and let us give Him the Name of\n‘Jesus’”; and Joseph went and brought a skilful circumciser.   And when the skilful\ncircumciser came he found our Lord Christ in the bosom of the pure Virgin Mary, and he said\nunto them, “Hold the Child; I shall be able to circumcise Him without wounding Him.”  And\nthe Child Jesus answered and said unto him, “O skilful man, I wish to see thy skill, and thy\npower, and thy work, for how wilt thou circumcise Me?  No blood shall flow from Me in this\nworld, except the blood, which shall flow from My right side.  When one shall pierce Me\nwith a spear in the place of the skull (Golgotha).  When I am on the wood of the Cross, blood\nshall flow from Me, and shall run down upon the earth, and it shall be for the salvation of\nAdam and all the world.”  And when the skilful circumciser heard the words of the Child\nJesus, he gathered together his razors and the iron instruments, and brought them into their\nhouse; and he rose up and bowed down at the feet of the Child Jesus.  And straightway his\nrazors melted and became like water, and he said unto our Lady Mary, “Pure and blessed art\nthou more than [all other] women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.  This thy Son is not\nof the seed of Adam, but He is the Son of God.  If He worketh a miracle like this when He is\na child, what will happen when He attaineth the age of manhood?  Peradventure He is the\nMessiah, Who is called Christ, about Whom the prophets prophesied, saying, ‘Behold a\nvirgin shall conceive, and shall bear a son, and His name shall be called “Emmanuel,” which\nis, being interpreted, “God with us.”’”  And our Lord Christ answered and said unto him,\n“Behold, I am He.  Wilt thou circumcise Me or not?  If thou wilt not I will do as My fathers\nand My grandfathers did.”  And the circumciser said unto Him, “Who was Thy father?  Who\nwas Thy grandfather?”  And our Lord Christ said unto him, “They were Abraham, Isaac and\nJacob, the fathers of the nation, and they lived before God gave them circumcision”; and the\ncircumciser said unto Him, “I am not able to talk with Thee, for the Holy Spirit is upon\nThee.”   And straightway our Lord Christ lifted up His eyes to heaven, and He said, “O\nFather, give me the circumcision which Thou didst give to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the\nearliest times, without the hand of man”; and straightway there appeared in Him\ncircumcision without the hand of man.   And the circumcision of our Lord was an\nincomprehensible mystery, even as was His going forth from the belly of Mary without\ndestroying her virginity, and like His entrance to the Apostles in the Hall of Zion, through\ndoors which were shut, and like the revelation of His power when in the operation of His\nwisdom He wished that not the smallest portion of His Body should be cut off in\ncircumcision.  But it was not so when the blood and water flowed from His side on the wood\nof the Cross, so that He might save Adam, and the blood flowed from Him, without addition\n\nor diminution of its substance, but by His wish so that He might fulfill the Law which He\ncommanded in olden time.  And when the circumciser saw this miracle and heard His words\nhe marveled exceedingly, and he bowed down thrice at the feet of our Lord Christ and said\nunto Him, “Thou art the Son of God and the King of Israel.”  And the circumciser went to his\nhome, and he began to tell the children of Israel what he had seen and heard.  And to our\nLord and God and Redeemer Jesus Christ, be honor and worship with His Good Father and\nthe Holy and Life-giving Spirit, now and for ever and ever.  Amen.\nAnd on this day also died our father Noah who belonged to the tenth generation from Adam. \nThis Noah from his earliest years used to contemplate divine mysteries, and to observe that\nsin was increasing, and evil growing to the full, and the righteous diminishing, and that all\nthat was flesh would be destroyed by the waters of the Flood.  Because of this he lamented,\nand wept, and his face became furrowed, and he preserved his virginity for five hundred\nyears; and he continued to minister to the body of our father Adam, and to keep the\ncommands of his God.  And then God commanded him to marry a wife and He told him that\nHe was going to destroy all flesh by the waters of the Flood, and that there would be left\nupon this earth none except his own seed.   And Noah married a wife whose name was\nHaykol, the daughter of Abu Zir, and he went in to her three times, and she brought forth\nShem, Ham and Japhet.   And then God said unto him, “Cut down trees on this holy\nmountain, and make an ark three hundred cubits long, and five hundred cubits broad, and\nthirty cubits high; and make inside it three stages.  The first stage shall be for the beasts, and\nthe second for the birds and for everything that creepeth, and the third stage for Noah, and his\nsons and their wives.  And he made inside it a cistern for water, and a store-chamber (or\npantry) for their food.  And he made a trumpet of Kashyan wood, the length of which was\nthree cubits, and the breadth one cubit and a half, which was to be blown three times a day. \nThe first time was at dawn to gather together the workmen for their work, the second was to\nassemble the people for their meal, and the third time was to send the people to bed.  When\nthe children of Cain saw Noah making an ark for the water of the Flood, they mocked at him\nand began to say, “Behold this old man is mad, or why would he say that the waters will rise\nabove the tops of the mountains?”   Then Noah took the body of our father Adam and\nembraced it.  And Shem his son took gold, and Ham took myrrh, and Japhet took incense,\nand carried them into the ark with the body of our father Adam.  And [Noah] took in with\nhim clean beasts, and animals, and birds, seven of each kind, and of the unclean beasts, and\nanimals, and birds, two of each kind.  And Noah placed the body of our father Adam facing\nthe east side, and he laid the three offerings upon his breast; and Noah, and his sons, and his\nwife, and their wives occupied the west side.  And then God, by His power, shut the door of\nthe ark on Noah, and He commanded the doors of heaven to be opened, and the storehouses\nof the deep, and the cataracts of the winds, and there went forth storm, and mist, and fog, and\ndarkness, and the sun and the moon and the stars withheld their light, and never before was\nthere such a terrible day.  When the children of Seth, who had committed fornication with the\nchildren of Cain, saw this, they knew that God was angry with them, and that the words\nwhich Noah had said unto them were true.  And they all ran to the ark to ask Noah to open its\ndoor to them, but they were unable to ascend the holy mountain, because the stones thereof\nwere like fire; and the ark was closed and sealed by the power of God.  And the angel of God\nused to dwell in the ark, and he became a chief to Noah and his sons.  And the waters of the\nFlood increased and they began to overpower the children of Cain, who were drowned.  By\nthe force of the water the ark was lifted up above the earth, and every being of flesh that\nlived on the earth perished.  And the waters rose above the tops of the mountains for a space\nof fifteen cubits, and they bore the ark and carried it down to the Garden; and Noah and his\nsons and all who were in the ark worshipped in the holy Garden.  Then the ark sailed over the\nwaters, by the force of the winds, and it continued to go onwards for one hundred and fifty\ndays, and it appeared on Mount Ararat, on the twenty-seventh day of the month of Tekemt\n(Oct.-Nov.).   And the waters being assuaged on the twenty-seventh day of the month of\nGenbot (May-June), on that day, the day on which he went into the ark, Noah came out from\nthe ark; and this day was the First Day of the week.  And God sent His voice to Noah telling\nhim to take large beasts and to offer up an offering on the altar before Him.  And Noah sent\nout the animals from inside the ark, and God promised Noah that He would not destroy the\nearth again, and as a mark of His promise He set a bow in the heavens so that all people\n\nmight see it.  And God blessed Noah and his sons, saying, “Increase and multiply and fill the\nearth”; and He commanded the earth to bring forth grass according to its custom, and the\nbeasts and cattle, and the fowl of the heavens, and everything which moveth [to bring forth\nyoung].  And after Noah had gone out from the ark he planted a vine, and drank of the wine\nthereof, and he became drunk and stripped himself naked.  When Ham has son saw him he\nmade a mock of him, and told his brethren, but they turned their faces from him, and covered\nhim with his apparel.  And when Noah recovered himself, and knew what his son Ham had\ndone he cursed him.  And after he had divided the whole earth among his sons, the day of his\ndeath arrived, and he died in his nine hundred and fiftieth year, and was buried on Mount\nArarat.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated the ascension of Elijah the prophet into heaven, being\nalive in the body.  This zealous prophet lived in the days of Ahab the king, and his soul was\nin travail each day, and all day, because of the deeds of the king and his abominable wife. \nThen his soul became angry, and he stood up before the king and said unto him, “Why hast\nthou forsaken the God of heaven, thou and thy wife Elzabel (Jezebel), in Whose hand is thy\nsoul, and [why] do ye worship the idol Baal?  And why have ye taken the vineyard of Naboth\nthe Jezreelite?  By the life of the Lord God of Israel, I swear that no rain shall descend upon\nthe earth from heaven except at my word.”  And straightway, whilst yet the words were in his\nmouth, the rivers dried up, and the green herb withered, and there was a famine in all the\nland.  And when God saw that Elijah the prophet by reason of his jealously for His honor\nafflicted himself concerning the famine, He commanded him to go to Dabra Karen (?), and a\nraven used to bring him food every day; and God willed to perform the wish of the prophet,\nand He did not permit his word to be made a lie.  And God willed and sent to him a raven\nwith food, but Elijah would not receive the food from the bird, because, according to the Law\nof the Old Testament, the raven was an unclean bird.   Did he perchance spare himself\nbecause of the famine, and command rain to fall?  And the prophet took the food from the\nraven and it defiled him not.  And God commanded the stream from which he used to drink\nto dry up, so that, peradventure, when he was thirsty he might have compassion upon men,\nand command rain to fall.   And in this matter the prophet did not spare himself, and\nmoreover, he came nigh to die through hunger and thirst.  And God commanded him to go to\nSarepta of Sidona where he was fed by widow woman.  And God thought that by [making\nhim do] this he would journey through the cities, and see the bodies of the dead cast out on\nthe road side, and would have compassion on the people in his heart, and command the rain\nto fall.  And when Elijah went to Sarepta of Sidona, he found that widow woman gathering\nfirewood, and he asked for bread from her that he might eat.  And she said unto him, “As\nGod liveth and as thy soul liveth I have only a handful of flour in my house, and I am going\nto make it [into bread] for my son, and we shall eat it and die; and also I have a little fat in a\npot.”  And the prophet said unto her, “Bring me a little water that I may drink, and a little\nbread that I may eat, and afterwards do thou eat.”  And the woman said in her heart, “Even if\nI am to die it is better for me to make it [into bread] for this pilgrim as he wisheth, and I will\nmake merry and think that I have eaten it myself.”  When the prophet knew the beauty of her\nmind and the integrity of her nature, he had compassion in his heart, and he asked God for\nrain.  And God accepted the word of the prophet because he had done this on account of his\njealously for Him.  And Elijah said unto her, “Believe me, and go and do as thou thinkest, but\nmake for me first a cake baked on the ashes, (then make one for thyself afterwards,) and\nbring it to me, and afterwards thou shalt make one for thyself and thy son, for thus saith God,\n“Thy flour barrel shall never become empty, and the fat in thy pot shall never finish until [the\nday] when God shall send rain upon the earth’”; and it came to pass even as the prophet said. \nAnd the woman went and made [the cake], even as the prophet commanded her, and he dwelt\nwith her until the days of the famine had ended.  And the woman had a son who fell sick and\ndied, and she rent her garments and made lamentation, and took the child and carried him to\nElijah into the upper chamber, and she wept and entreated Elijah, in God’s Name, on behalf\nof the child.  And Elijah laid his face upon him, and the child came to life straightway; and it\nis said that this child was Jonah the prophet.  Then Elijah sent his disciple to Ahab, King of\nIsrael, and he said unto him, “Behold the descent of rain from heaven is nigh.”  And the king\nsearched for Elijah and wanted to kill him, because he had shut up the heavens so that no rain\nfell for three years and seven months.   And then Elijah took the prophets of Baal and\n\nslaughtered them with his own hand.  When Elzabel (Jezebel), the wife of Ahab the king,\nheard this she was wroth, and she sent messengers after Elijah and she wished to kill him\nbecause he had killed the prophets of Baal.  And Elijah was very sorry because of this, and he\nsaid, “O God, they have slain Thy prophets, and have overthrown Thy altars, and I only am\nleft, and they wish to kill my soul.”  And God said unto him, “Fear thou not, for I have left\nunto Me seventy men who have not worshipped the idol Baal.  As for thyself, who can take\naway thy soul?  I will take thee up into heaven whilst thou art living in the body.”  When\nAhab the king was dead, his son reigned in his stead, and he did evil before God.  And he fell\nsick of a disease, and he sent messengers to the idol Afron to ask him whether he would\nrecover from his illness or not.  And Elijah the prophet met the messengers of the king, and\nhe said unto them, “Say ye to the king:  Thou shalt died of this disease.”  And when they told\nthe king this, he knew that the man [who spoke this] was Elijah, the prophet, and he sent him\na captain, and fifty soldiers with him.  And Elijah was sitting on the top of a mountain, and\nthe captain said unto him, “O prophet of God, descend and come to the king.”  And Elijah the\nprophet said unto him, “If I be a prophet of God, let fire come down form heaven and\nconsume thee”; and fire came down from heaven and consumed him, and those who were\nwith him.  And the king sent unto him a second captain, and there were fifty soldiers with\nhim.  And he said unto him, “O prophet of God, descend and come to the king.”  And Elijah\nsaid unto him, “If I be a prophet of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume thee”;\nand straightway fire came down from heaven and consumed that captain and those who were\nwith him.  And the king sent a third captain to him, and that captain came to him humbly, and\nhe bowed down before the prophet, when still some distance from him, and he asked him,\nsaying, “Have mercy on my soul”; and Elijah came down and went with him to the king,\neven as God commanded.  And he rebuked the king for his evil deeds, and the king died on\nhis bed.  Then Elijah went to the River Jordan, and with him was Elisa his disciple, and he\nthrew his garment on the River Jordan and divided it into two parts, and passed over.  And\nbehold there came a mist, and an earthquake, and flashes of lightning, and horses of fire, and\nthey carried off Elijah the prophet, and bore him up into heaven.  And then his disciple Elisa\nwept and said, “O my father Elijah, [behold] the chariots of Israel!  Let a double portion of\nthy spirit rest upon me.”  And Elijah rent his garment into two parts, and threw [them] on\nElisa, and the spirit was doubled upon him.  And all the miracles which Elijah performed\nElisa his disciple performed also.  Elijah passed over the River Jordan once, and Elisa passed\nover it twice; Elijah raised from the dead one dead man, and Elisa raised two.  And Elisa his\ndisciple performed many miracles, for the Holy Spirit which was on Elijah was doubled on\nhim.  And Elijah the prophet and Enoch shall come together in the last days, and they shall\nrebuke the false Christ, and they shall kill his people, and their bodies shall be cast out for\nthree days and a half, and then they shall be raised up, and the resurrection of the dead shall\ntake place.   This prophet Elijah was a righteous man, and he was the first to live in the\nGarden in the days of the Old Testament.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Makaryanu (Marcianus), the eighth\nArchbishop of the city of Alexandria.   This saint was appointed Archbishop after the\nAscension of our Lord Jesus Christ; and one hundred years after the second destruction and\npillage of Jerusalem, in the ninth year [of his office].  And he remained in his office for nine\nyears, teaching the people and confirming them in the True Faith; and he converted very\nmany of the infidels and pagans, and brought them into the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ. \nAnd he baptized them with Christian baptism, and illumined them with the knowledge of our\nLord Jesus Christ in the Law of Christianity.  And this father pursued a good course life, and\nwalked prudently, and he pleased God and died in peace.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Basil, Bishop of Caesarea.  The name of the\nfather of this saint was Esderos, and he was a priest, holy and pure, and was a man of the city\nof Antioch.  And he begot four sons, Basil, and Gregory Peter, and Cherion, and Macrinus;\nand they were all holy and perfect men.  And this saint was filled with the Holy Ghost, and\nhe composed the well-known Liturgy which beareth his name.  And God performed very\nmany signs and wonders by his hands, which are written down in the history of his strife, and\nof them are the seven following.  FIRST MIRACLE:  The story of Peter, the brother of the\nBishop of the city of Sebastia, and how he had a wife, and how the people reviled him\nbecause of this wife, and how Basil came to him, and revealed his spiritual fight to the\n\npeople, and the mystery of his relations with his wife, and how Peter and his wife were\nvirgins, and had no knowledge whatsoever of the operation of sin.  And Basil informed the\npeople how he saw the angel of God overshadowing them [in bed], and how the people saw\nSaint Peter, and the blessed woman his wife, with the angel of God overshadowing them, and\nhow the people marveled and glorified God, and bowed down at the feet of the blessed Peter,\nand asked him to forgive them their transgression, and how he forgave all those who had\nslandered him.   SECOND MIRACLE:   Concerned the church which the heretics and\nschismatics seized by violence, but were unable to open the doors thereof; but when the\nbelievers prayed the doors were opened through the prayer of Basil.  THIRD MIRACLE: \nThe story of Saint Abba Ephraim, who saw a pillar of light which reached from the earth to\nheaven; and he heard a voice, saying, “This is Basil.”  And Saint Ephraim came to the city of\nCaesarea, and he saw the virtues and the righteousness of the blessed Basil.  And Saint Basil\nappointed Ephraim a deacon, and prayed over him, and he made him to speak in the Greek\ntongue.  FOURTH MIRACLE:  The story of the wise astrologer, who never made a mistake\nin his computations.  When Saint Basil was sick, and he knew that the time of his death [was\nnigh], he summoned that astrologer and said unto him, “When am I going to die?”  And the\nastrologer said unto him, “Thou wilt die in the evening, and thy soul shall go forth from thy\nbody [at the time].”  And Saint Basil said unto him, “If I remain [alive], and do not die until\nthe morning, wilt thou became a Christian?”  And the astrologer said unto him, “Yea.”  And\nSaint Basil entreated God, and God added three days to his days, and that wise and learned\nJewish astrologer, who was the greatest of his class, believed, and Saint Basil baptized him\nand all the men of his house with Christian baptism, and then he died in peace.   FIFTH\nMIRACLE:  The story of the man who denied Christ, and who wrote his denial of Christ\nwith his own hand upon a paper, and gave it to Satan.  And Saint Basil shut up that man in a\ncertain place, and he prayed to God so earnestly that at length Satan brought back that paper\nwhich the man had written; and thus Saint Basil saved him.  SIXTH MIRACLE:  The story\nof the priest who was a virgin, and his wife, who had with them a man who was sick of dire\ndisease, and how Basil knew of the integrity of the priest and his wife, and how he slept with\nthe sick man that night, and how he prayed to God on his behalf, and how the man was\nhealed of his sickness straightway.  SEVENTH MIRACLE:  The story of the honorable lady\nwho wrote down a list of all her sins on a piece of paper, and sealed it and gave it to Saint\nBasil, and asked him to pray on her behalf to God until all her sins, which were written down\non that sealed paper, were blotted out.  And Saint Basil prayed on her behalf until all the sins,\nwith the exception of one, were blotted out; and the blessed Basil commanded her to go to\nSaint Abba Ephraim, so that he might pray for that sin to be blotted out.  And when she went\nto Saint Abba Ephraim, he spoke to her, saying, “Hasten and get thee back to the blessed\nBasil before he dieth, and he will forgive thee, for he is the chief of priests.”  And when she\nreturned she found that Saint Basil was dead, and the bearers had lifted him up and were\ncarrying him on his bier to bury him.  And the woman wept with a bitter weeping, and she\nlaid that paper upon his body, and that sin which was written on the paper was blotted out\nfrom it.  When all the people who were there saw this miracle they marveled exceedingly,\nand glorified God, Who giveth such grace to those who fear Him.  And Saint Basil performed\nmany signs and miracles besides those which we have written here in this book.  And he\ncomposed many beautiful Homilies and Instructions for monks, and he translated many\nBooks of the Old and New Testaments, and he drew up Canons which are to be found in the\nhands of believers unto this day.\n Salutation to Noah and his wife and sons.  Salutation to Basil.  Salutation to Abba Moses,\nwho dwelt in the desert sixty winters.  He gazed at the hearts of the saints until he became\nstupefied, and his face changed and became coals of fire.   Salutation to Makaryanu\n(Marcianus), the eighth Archbishop of Alexandria.   Salutation to the circumcision of our\nLord.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and Abba Benjamin fled into Upper Egypt, [and\nstayed there] till the end of ten years.   When God had destroyed that heretic Makokas\n(Makawkas), and the churches and the Christians were at rest and in peace, Abba Benjamin\nreturned to his throne, and lived in his own house.  And the chief monks of the holy desert of\nScete came to him, and they asked him to go with them and consecrate the new church, that\nis to say, the church of Abba Macarius; and he rose up and went with them in great joy, and\nhe consecrated the church.  And when he began to anoint the table of the altar with the holy\nMeron oil, the saint saw the hand of God anointing it with him, and he fell upon his face in\ngreat fear.   And one of the Cherubim raised him up and said unto him, “Rise up, be not\nafraid, and write for this place a holy rule, for it is God’s mystery.  And no man shall enter it\nin pride of heart, nor by bribery, but only him that is appointed thereto; and no man shall dare\nto speak a vain word therein, for it is a house of the holy things of God.  This Canon shall be\nthe rule in this sanctuary for ever.  For behold the days shall come when they shall destroy\nthe commandments which their fathers ordained, and they shall not discharge their\nobligations, and the holy place shall become a place of scoffing.”  And Abba Benjamin said,\n“Verily this is the house of God, and this is the door of heaven.”  And as he was holding\nconverse with the Cherub, he looked towards the west of the church and saw an aged man\nwith a beautiful face, and a long beard, and his countenance was shining like that of an\nangel.  And Abba Benjamin was pleased when he saw that [old man], and he said within\nhimself, “If one of the bishops were to die, I should make this old man bishop in his stead.” \nAnd the Cherub said unto him, “O Benjamin, whouldst thou make this old man bishop?  This\nis Abba Macarius, the father of all archbishops, and bishops, and monks, and he hath come in\nthe spirit this day to rejoice with his sons; and not an archbishop who was appointed by him,\nand not one of his sons, will be absent, neither will the spiritual fruits of his monasteries be\nwanting.”  And the Cherub said unto him, “If his sons have kept his commandments, and\nhave followed in his steps, they will be with him where he is in glory; but if they have\ntransgressed his commandments they shall not share [his] inheritance with him.”  And Abba\nMacarius said unto the angel, the Cherub, “My lord, do not decide about my sons in these\nwords; but if there be left in the bunch only a single grape, the blessing of God shall be on it. \nIf there be left in them love for each other I believe that God will not drive them away from\nHis kingdom.”   And the Archbishop Abba Benjamin marveled at the mercy of Abba\nMacarius; and Abba Benjamin wrote a Canon and placed it in the church for a perpetual\nmemorial.  And he asked our Lord Jesus Christ that his death might take place as it were to-\nday, and in consequence he died on the eighth day of the month of Ter.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Andronicus, the thirty-seventh Archbishop of\nthe city of Alexandria.  This holy man was a deacon, and a son of one of the elders of the city\nof Alexandria, and he was a wise and a merciful man, and he was learned in the Books of the\nChurch.   The son of his father’s brother was governor of Alexandria, and because of his\noffice, and the size of his house, this saint did not live in monasteries as did all the\narchbishops his predecessors, but he lived in his nephew’s house in the city of Alexandria all\nthe days of his life and archiepiscopate.  And this father was appointed archbishop in the\ntenth year of the reign of Heraclius, Emperor of Rome, in the nine hundred and thirty-third\nyear of the kingdom of King Alexander (A.D. 621-2).  And in the days of his father Kesra\n(Khusrau), King of Persia, rose up, and he was an infidel and worshipped the sun.  And he\ngathered together his armies, now they were many, and he invaded the country of Rome, and\n\nthe countries of Syria and Palestine, and he laid waste these countries, and carried off their\ngoods.  Then he attacked the country of Egypt and came to the city of Alexandria, [round\nabout which] there were two hundred monasteries, which were full of monks, and also full of\ngoods and possessions wherewith the monks lived lives of pleasure.  And because of this\nGod gave the King of Persia a dominion over them, and he plundered the monasteries, and\nslew all the monks who were in them, and only the few were left alive who hid themselves\nfrom him and escaped; and to this day these monasteries have neither been [re]-built nor [re]-\nconsecrated.   And when the men of Alexandria heard what the Persians had done, they\nopened to them the gates of the city.  And Kesra (Khusrau) the king saw in a dream and it\nseemed as if one said unto him, “Behold, I have given this city into thy hand.  Thou shalt not\nlay it waste, but slay the strong men who are therein, for they are men of violence.  And take\nthe king of the city, and bind him in fetters, and send him away.”  And he ordered the men of\nthe city to bring unto him the strong young men, the days of whose years were from eighteen\nyears up to forty or fifty years, so that he might give each of them twenty dinars in gold, and\nmight enroll them as soldiers to serve in his regiments and armies, and protect the city.  And\nthe people imagined that what he said was the truth, and eighty hundred men went out to\nhim.  And when he began to count all their numbers, they imagined that they were going to\nreceive gold; but as soon as he had finished counting them all, he slew them with the sword. \nAnd then he went up into Upper Egypt, and came to the city Nikyus (Pshati, in the province\nof Menu). and he heard that in the cells, and in the monasteries and religious houses, there\nwere seven hundred monks whose works were evil, and he killed them all with the sword. \nAnd when Heraclius, the Emperor of Rome, heard of what the King of Persia had done, he\ngathered together his army, and marched against him, and slew all his army, and plundered\nall his country.  And the spiritual fight of this Abba Andronicus was exceedingly good, and\nhe sat for seven years, and he pleased God, and he died in peace in the three hundred and\nforty-seventh year of the martyrs (A.D. 631), before the kingdom of the Arabs [was\nestablished] in the country of Egypt.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Benjamin, the thirty-eighth Archbishop of the\ncity of Alexandria.  This was a man of the city of Barset, and the son of one of the wealthy\nmen thereof, and he became a monk, in his early years, with a certain holy man whose name\nwas Tewenas (Theonas), in a monastery to the west of the city of Alexandria.  And he grew\ncontinually in good works, and he became very learned in the Scriptures, and in the Books of\nthe Church.  One night he saw a vision and it seemed as if one said unto him, “Rejoice, O\nBenjamin, for thou shalt pasture the flock of Christ.”  And he told his teacher that he had\nseen a vision, and his teacher said unto him, “Beware of Satans, lest they lead thee astray by\npride.”  And he added to his virtues and to his righteousness, and then his teacher took him\nwith him, and carried him to Abba Andronicus, and told him of the vision which his son\nBenjamin had seen; and Abba Andronicus made him a priest, and delivered to him the charge\nof the church, and he continued to administer the church rightly and well until Abba\nAdronicus died, and then he was appointed archbishop.  And great tribulation fell upon him\nwhile he held office.   And before the great tribulation came upon him, the angel of God\nappeared unto him, and told him what would happen unto him, and commanded him to flee,\nand to take his bishops with him.  And this father consecrated the Offering and administered\nto the people the Holy Mysteries, and he commanded them to be strong in the True Faith, and\nhe made them to know what was going to happen.  And then he sent letters to all the bishops,\nand to all the heads of the monasteries, and commanded them to take to flight. Then he\ndeparted into the desert of Scete, to the monastery of Abba Macarius, and from there he\ndeparted into Upper Egypt.   And Heraclius, Emperor of Rome, had dominion over the\nchurches, and over the believers, and he punished very many of them.  And he seized the\nbrother of Abba Benjamin, whose name was Minas, and he tortured him, and burnt his sides\nwith fire, and afterwards he had him drowned in the river.  And in those days the Emperor\nHeraclius saw in his sleep that one said unto him, “Behold there shall come upon thee many\npeople who are circumcised, and they shall overcome thee, and shall rule over the country.” \nNow he imagined that these people would be Jews, and that he would baptize many of them,\nbut the vision which he saw referred to the kingdom of the Muslims.   And they were\nMuslims, and they came to him from the land of Yatreb which is a district and a kingdom in\nthe land of Syria.  And in those days ‘Amr, the son of As, came to the land of Egypt, and he\n\nruled over it, and dwelt therein for three years.  In the one hundred and nineteenth year (sic)\nof the martyrs ‘Amr came to the city of Alexandria, and he destroyed the fortress thereof, and\nhe burned many churches, and he burned the church of Saint Mark the Evangelist, on the sea-\nshore, which is known to be now under the earth (i.e. submerged).  And he likewise burned\nthe monasteries and the churches which were round about the city of Alexandria, and he\ncarried off as spoil all the goods which were in them.   Then the captain of the soldiers\nbrought ships to the church of the Blessed Mark, and he thrust his hand into the sarcophagus\nand found the body of Saint Mark and carried it to this ship.  And when ‘Amr, the son of As,\nlearned the story of Abba Benjamin, and why he had fled, he wrote his letter and sent it into\nevery district in Egypt, saying, “Come, be not afraid, and govern thy people and thy\nchurches.”  And Abba Benjamin came forth from the place whither he had fled in the tenth\n(?) year of the reign of the Emperor Heraclius, and in the third year of the kingdom of the\nMuslims.   And ‘Amr, the son of As, honored Abba Benjamin with great honor, and he\ncommanded his soldiers to give back the churches, and all their possessions, and all their\nlands to his priests.  And he said unto him, “Pray for me, for I am going to the country of the\nWest, and I will become the king over the Five Cities, and when I come back I will do\nwhatsoever thou desirest.”  And Abba Benjamin said unto him, “God shall make straight thy\npath”; and he told him everything that would happen unto him.  And when ‘Amr wished to\ngo away, they brought nigh the ships so that the soldiers might depart, and outside the port\nthey took all the ships, except the ship in which was the head of Saint Mark the Evangelist,\nfor that would not go out of the port.  And all the sailors gathered together, and tied ropes to\nthat ship, and to these they tied other ropes and hauled, but the ship would not leave the port. \nAnd ‘Amr, the governor, said, “Burn this ship,” but the captain was afraid to do so, and he\ntold ‘Amr that he was afraid, because of the head of Saint Mark the Evangelist which was in\nit, and he revealed the matter to him.  And the governor sent to Abba Benjamin and told him\nabout the head of Saint Mark the Evangelist, and that night Abba Benjamin saw a vision, and\nin it Saint Mark said unto him, “Prepare for me a place with thee.”   And when Abba\nBenjamin heard these words he rose up, and went to the governor, and told him [about the\nvision], and he said unto him, “This is the head of Saint Mark the Evangelist.”  And as soon\nas Abba Benjamin had taken from the ship the head of Saint Mark, that ship left the port\nimmediately.   When the governor saw this he marveled exceedingly, and he gave Abba\nBenjamin much money, and commanded him to build a church for Saint Mark; and Abba\nBenjamin built a beautiful church for him, and laid the head and body of the saint in it.  And\nthis father fought strenuously with the pagans, and he converted many of them, and brought\nthem into the True Faith and confirmed them.  And in the days of this saint God brought a\ngreat and severe famine upon all countries, and no famine which had ever been before it was\nso dire.   And countless people died of this famine, and their bodies were cast into the\nhighways and market-places of the cities.  And Abba Benjamin suffered from a disease in his\nfoot for twenty years, and he died in peace; and all the days of his archiepiscopate were nine\nand thirty years.\nAnd on this day also [died] Melkeyas (Malachi) the prophet and righteous man, whom they\ncall “Malak.”  This prophet was born after the people returned from the Captivity, in a place\nwhich is called Sufas.  When he was a young man he followed a good course of life, and all\nthe people honored him for his righteousness, and for this reason they called him “Melkeyas”\n(Malachi), which is, being interpreted, “angel” (or “prince”), because his appearance was\nexceeding goodly; and he described in his prophecy everything which was to come to pass. \nAnd the angel of God used to appear unto him by night, and hold converse with him, but the\npeople never saw the angel, and they only heard his voice; now some of them were worthy to\nsee his face openly, even as it is written in the Book of Judges.  And being still a young man\nhe died and was buried with his fathers in his own field.  Salutation to Melkeyas (Malachi).\nSalutation to Andronicus, who after living on the top of a pillar for seventy years died before\nthe coming of the Muslim kings into Egypt.\nSalutation to Abba Benjamin who was so learned in the Scriptures that he was made\nArchbishop of Alexandria.\n\nSalutation to the consecration of thy house [O Mark the Evangelist], by Abba Benjamin. \n[These salutations are omitted in the Bodleian MS.]\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and this is ordained in the churches of the\nEgyptians.  And if the day of Bayramum fall on the First Day of the week, or on the Sabbath\nof the Jews, one shall fast on the Fourth Day of the week preceding it until the evening, and\nshall only eat what it is meet to eat during the Great Fast.  And if the festival of the Birth and\nthe festival of the Baptism fall on the Sabbath, or on the First Day of the week, or on the\nsecond day, it is impossible to fast on the day preceding the Sabbath and the First Day of the\nweek, but they shall eat what is eaten during the Great Fast.  And on the night of the festival\nof the Baptism they shall rise up before midnight, and pray over the water and dip\nthemselves in it.  And the reason why they must rise up before midnight is that the young\nmay not be cast away in the water when they are baptized.  And they shall consecrate the\nOffering before the day dawneth, and they shall come into the church very early, even as the\nApostles commanded in the holy Canon.  And the Melchites, if the festival of the Birth and\nthe festival of the Baptism fall on the day before the Sabbath, on the First Day of the week,\nfast on the sixth day of the week preceding the festival until the ninth hour, according to their\nfrequent custom.  And on the day before the Sabbath; and before the First Day of the week,\nthey ordain the consecration (of the Eucharist), at the third hour or earlier, they eat a young . .\n. and drink if they wish.  And then the priests sit in the church, and pray the prayer of the\nhours, and read the prophecy which is suitable for the festival.  And they pray over the water\nat the time of evening on that day, which is the tenth day of the month of Ter.  But this is not\naccording to what the Apostles commanded in the holy Canon, for the pure Apostles\ncommanded them to keep the festival of the Epiphany, which is, being interpreted, the\n“appearance of our God” on the seventh day of the month of Ter.   And the Melchites\ntransgress the command of the holy fathers, the doctors of the Church, and they eat on the\nday of the festival, in the morning if it fall on the Fourth or the Sixth Day of the week, and\nthey do not fast on the day before it instead of it.   As for us, we ask our Lord Christ to\ncleanse us from all our sins, and to reveal the glory of His Godhead in our hearts even as He\nrevealed it in the River Jordan--to Him be glory, etc.\nAnd on this day died Abba Tawbentos (Theopantus).  This saint was brought up from his\nyouth in the house of Abba Tauna (Theonas), Archbishop of Romya, and it was he who\narrayed him in the garb of the monastic life.   And when the archbishop saw that he was\nendowed with wisdom and strength he made him a bishop, and the head of a monastery\noutside the city of Alexandria in a place which is called Tinadiran; and the number of the\nmonks who were subject to his rule was seven hundred.   And after this when Tawbentos\n(Theopantus?), the bishop and preacher and the brethren who were with him, heard of the\n\ncommotion which was taking place through the Emperor Diocletian, the heretic, and\nworshipper of idols, he fled and departed to Dabra Sihat, and took up his abode with a God-\nfearing virgin, and he lived hidden in her house for a long time.  At the beginning of his stay\nhe found that she worshipped idols through fear of the emperor, but he converted her from\nerror to the Faith of Christ.  And from there he went to Dabra Tarnut and Dabra Marmus,\nwishing to hear the histories of the churches of Egypt, and he lived in each monastery hidden\nfor two or three days (?), submitting himself to fasting, and prayer, and many vigils.  And all\nthe brethren testified that the gift of the Holy Spirit had descended upon him, and God\nwrought signs and miracles by his hands, and he even converted many thieves and robbers to\nthe service of Christ, and made them monks.   And having grown very old and grey, and\nknowing that the day of his departure was nigh, he exhorted his children to be strong in the\nTrue Faith, and to keep his commandments, and he died in peace.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Abba Kinaria (Cynarius), and Batrika (Patricia) the\nqueen, and Tomiani the martyr.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

And he gave all his\nmoney in his lifetime to the poor Christians, and to the churches and monasteries, and all his\nmoney came to an end before his death, and he died in debt to his brother’s son.  During the\ndays of his archiepiscopate he never ate bread at the expense of any Christian person, or at\nthe expense of any nobleman, or any poor man; and he never accepted a present (or fee) from\nany of them.  He held his office for eight and twenty years, and he died on the day of the\nfestival of the Baptism (i.e. Epiphany), on the eleventh day of the month of Ter in the nine\nhundred and thirty-second year of the martyrs (A.D. 1216).\nAnd on this day also died Saint Justus, and Saint Fayos.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father and fighter Abba Wakris.  This saint was brought up\nwith Basil the Great, and he made him a priest; and he was of goodly appearance, and his\nface was very pleasing.  As a young man his first act was to desire the governor’s wife, for he\nloved her dearly, and she loved him, and they made a plan together to go to another place\nwhere they could fulfill their desires.   And whilst they were taking pains to arrange this\nmatter Wakris saw himself in a dream bound in fetters, and standing up before the governor’s\ntribune, and there were many bound in fetters with him, and each one of them was being\nquestioned concerning his sins.  And he said in his heart, “What is the meaning of my being\nfettered?   Can it possibly be because of this woman, with whom I wish to defraud her\nhusband, who will lay information against me and have me brought to this serious state?” \nAnd whilst he was feeling disturbed over this matter there came unto him a man in the form\nof an old friend, and he said unto him, “What is the meaning of this thy being fettered?”  And\nWakris wished to hide himself, and was ashamed of his sin.  And when his friend pressed\nhim, he said unto him, “O my friend, thus and thus have I done.  It seemeth to me that so and\nso hath laid an information against me, because of his wife, and because of this I am afraid\nand am troubled.”  And the angel who had come unto him in the form of his friend, said unto\nhim, “O my beloved, swear unto me by the Gospel that thou wilt not do this thing, and [then]\nthou shalt not go back to it a second time; I will be surety for thee.”  And Wakris swore to\nhim by the Gospel.  And when he woke up from his sleep he knew that the vision which he\nhad seen was true, and he therefore left his city and departed to Alexandria, where he found a\ncertain God-fearing woman, whose name was Helani; and when they were holding converse\ntogether he told her everything which was in his heart.   And she said unto him, “Abandon\nthy splendid apparel, and dress thyself in a humble garb, and make thyself a close follower of\nGod.”  And from there he went into the desert, and he dwelt there and lived upon the herbs\nthereof until his belly became dried up, like a stone, and exhaustion seized him, and at length\nour Lord came and healed him.  And the devils used to tempt him and afflict him severely,\nbut he fought strenuously with fasting and with prayer.  And in the winter time he used to\nstand naked under the falling rain, and in the summer he was afflicted by the burning heat of\nthe sun, and by the cold at night, and at length the gift of the Holy Spirit was given unto him. \nAnd the angels used to come unto him and feed him with the bread of heaven, and give him\nto drink out of the heavenly cup, and he was worthy of divine vision so that he might know\nhidden things.  And he composed three homilies, one on those who dwell in the desert, and\none on the company of the brethren, and one on the priesthood.  One day there came unto\nhim a certain dweller in the desert whose name was Bula, and they embraced each other, and\nBula said unto him, “O my brother Wakris, do not live alone.  Make a few of the brethren to\ncome and live with thee, to comfort thee, and thou shalt be delivered from the war of Satan”;\nand he did so.  And one day there came to him three Satans who had taken the forms of the\nheretics of Arius, and Nestorius, and Mani, and he disputed with them about their faiths, and\nhe vanquished them by the words of the Holy Scriptures, and by the doctrine of the Orthodox\nFathers; and he worked many miracles, and his miracles were innumerable.  One day having\narrived at the church he wished to go in, but found it closed, and the brethren searched for the\nkeys and could not find them; and having made the sign of the Cross over the gates they\nopened to him by his will.  And this Wakris is he of whom it is said, that when the brethren\nsaid unto him, “Thy father is dead,” he replied to them, “Ye lie; my father is a heavenly being\nand cannot die.”  And behold his history is written in the narrative of his strife, and in the\n\nBook of the Histories of the Holy Fathers.  And having grown very old and grey, he departed\nto God Whom he loved.\nSalutation to Thy Baptism by which every man is cleansed of his sins.\nSalutation to Thy Baptism which took place at the end of thirty winters.\nSalutation to Justus, and to Guedet.  Salutation to John, who gave twenty thousand dinars in\nsilver and gold to the poor and needy.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

[and he\nwas so greatly feared] that when the Persians said [to their fellows] “Behold Theodore hath\ncome,“ their hearts (i.e. courage) would break, and they would flee.  And some of the men\nwho were there said, “Theodore is the god of the men of Rome, and it is he who raised up\ntwice Nigomidos (Nicomedes), the son of the King of Kuez (Khuzistan), because of whom\nDiocletian denied Christ, and worshipped idols.  Now Diocletian had deposited Nigomidos\n(Nicomedes) with the Archbishop [of Antioch], to be kept in safety, and the archbishop took\nfrom his father gold weighed in a balance, as much as the young man weighed, and he sent it\nback to his father.  And Saint Theodore was fighting on the river which is called Bunabesi;\nand he had a friend who was called Lavendius.  And one night he saw, as it were, a ladder\nwhich reached from earth to heaven, and at the head of the ladder was our Lord sitting upon a\ngreat throne, and there were round about Him thousands of thousands [of angels], and tens of\nthousands of angels were standing before Him.  And he saw under the ladder a great serpent,\nwhich was Satan.  And he who was sitting upon the throne said unto him, “O Theodore, the\nAnatolian, Dost thou wish to become a son to Me?”  And Theodore the Anatolian said unto\nHim, “Who art Thou, my Lord?”  And He said unto him, “I am Jesus the Word of God, and,\nas for thee, needs must that thou shalt shed thy blood for My Name’s sake.”   And then\nTheodore saw one of those who were standing there take him and dip him in the Lake of Fire\nthree times, and his whole person became like fire, and he was like unto those who were\nstanding round the throne.  And Theodore the Anatolian said unto our Lord, “My Lord, I do\n[not] wish to be separated from my friend Lavendius.”  And our Lord answered and said unto\nhim, “Not Lavendius only, but Banikoros, the captain of the army of Kuez (Khuzistan) also.” \nThen Theodore the Anatolian saw those angels seize Lavendius and [Ba]Nikoros, and dip\nthem into the Lake of Fire; and they gave them to Theodore the Anatolian, and he rejoiced\nwith great joy, and they embraced each other.  Then the might of God carried them to the\nplace where was [Ba]Nikoros, the captain of the army of Kuez (Khuzistan), and he\nwelcomed them, and embraced them, as if he knew them; now they had never seen him\n[before].  Then Banikoros described to them that vision, even as they had seen it, and they\nmarveled exceedingly.   And Banikoros said to Theodore the Anatolian, “Know, O my\nbrother, that they have given me and my brother into thy hand.”   Then they rose up\n\nstraightway, and came to their soldiers, and they all rose up and made an agreement together\nto shed their blood for the Name of our Lord Christ.  And it came to pass that at this time the\nemperor sent and summoned Theodore the Anatolian to him, and he informed him that he\nhad made peace with the King of Kuez (Khuzistan).  When the Emperor Diocletian denied\nour Lord Christ and worshipped idols, the King of Kuez (Khuzistan) rejoiced exceedingly. \nAnd Saint Theodore the Anatolian said unto them, “He who wisheth to save his soul from the\nsword, let him depart; and he who wisheth to fight for the Name of Christ our Lord, let him\ndwell with us.”  And they all cried out with a loud voice, saying, “The death which thou diest\nwe will die with thee, and thy God is our God.”  And the blessed Theodore the Anatolian said\nunto them, “If that which ye say be true, get ye all down into the river and dip yourselves in\nthe water thereof, in the Name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.”   And\nstraightway they stripped off their raiment, and went down into the river, and they dipped\nthemselves therein thrice, even as he told them.  And as they were coming up out of the water\nthey heard a voice from heaven saying, “Be ye strong, O My martyrs, and be ye conquerors,\nfor I will be with you.”   And when Theodore the Anatolian drew nigh unto the city of\nAntioch, he left the soldiers outside, and he went in with his two friends Lavendius and\nBanikoros, and the emperor welcomed Theodore the Anatolian with gladness, and he asked\nhim questions about the war and about the army; and Theodore told him everything that had\nhappened.  And after this the emperor reminded him to worship Apollo in his presence, and\nSaint Theodore the Anatolian rebuked the emperor; and the emperor cursed him and his\nfriend Lavendius and his companion Banikoros, and they cursed the emperor.  And Sidrakos,\nthe father of Saint Theodore the Anatolian, died.   And the emperor was wroth, and he\ncommanded his soldiers to carry away the saints Lavendius and Banikoros to the country of\nthe Menadaweyan, so that they might be tortured there; now Diocletian was afraid of the\nPersians, because Banikoros was captain of the Persians.  And they tortured Lavendius and\nhis friend Banikoros, and they received crowns of martyrdom on the twelfth day of the\nmonth of Ter.  And as for the Anatolian, the emperor commanded the soldiers to drive one\nhundred and fifty-three great long nails into his body, and they laid him upon a komol tree,\nand drove those nails into his body.  And God sent His angel Michael the Archangel to him,\nand he comforted him and strengthened him in his tribulation.  And at that time our Lord\nChrist appeared unto Saint Theodore the Anatolian, and He said unto him, “Peace be unto\nthee, O My chosen one, Theodore the Anatolian!  Bear thou patiently all this suffering.  And\nnow, dost thou wish Me to take out all these nails from thy body, and to heal thee, and to put\nto shame this perverse emperor?”   And Theodore the Anatolian said unto our Lord Jesus\nChrist, “Behold, it is better for me to die for Thy Name’s sake.”  And our Lord Jesus said\nunto Theodore the Anatolian, “Behold, I have prepared three crowns for thee:  one for thy\nvirginity, and one because thou hast labored for My beloved, and one for thy death for My\nName’s sake.  If a man be in grief and sorrow which is very grievous, and tribulation hath\nfallen upon him, and he pray to Me in thy name, I will relieve him, and will deliver him, and\nwill make him glad and will bless him.  And if a man be in tribulation at sea in respect of his\nship, and he pray to Me in thy name, I will deliver him.  And if a man go into the battle, or go\ninto a fight, and he call upon thy name, I will deliver him, and will be his helper.  And if a\nman build a shrine for thee, or write a book of thy strife, or commemorate thee, or bring a\ngift in thy name, I will receive him and make him to be glad in the kingdom of the heavens. \nAnd if a man give alms to the poor and needy, or to the orphans, or to the prisoner, or to the\npilgrim, I will forgive him his sin, and I will reward him in the kingdom of the heavens. And\nhim that doeth a good deed on the day of thy commemoration and for thy name’s sake, I will\nreceive.”  And after this our Lord Jesus Christ gave Theodore the benediction of peace, and\nwent up into heaven.  And Theodore saw three angels who gave him three crowns, and then\nhe died, and he delivered up his soul into the hand of God, and he received the crown of\nmartyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  And after his death the Emperor Diocletian sent\nto the soldiers of Theodore heathen priests carrying idols, and a herald went round\nproclaiming thus:  “Whosoever loveth the emperor let him worship the glorious gods.”  And\nall the soldiers cried out, saying, ”There is no king except our Lord Jesus Christ, the King of\nkings and Lord of lords.”  And when the emperor heard this he sent his soldiers and they cut\noff the heads of these men with the sword, and they were in number two hundred and fifty\nthousand.  And the air was filled with beings of light who placed crowns upon their heads.\n\nSalutation to Thy loving going, O Lord, into the house of the marriage-feast to make water\ninto wine.\nSalutation to Michael the Archangel who went to help Theodore.\nSalutation to thee, O Theodore, thou shoot from the country of the East.\nSalutation to the two hundred and fifty thousand men who suffered with Theodore. \nSalutation to Lavendius and to his companion Banikoros.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Julian the martyr, and Daniel the monk, the son of\nIsaac.  [Omitted in the Bodleian MS.]\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

this miracle was the first which the Lord wrought in\nGalilee.  And by His Divine command He changed water and made it into sweet wine, and\nnot thin wine, but wine sound and good to the taste, and of pleasant perfume.  To this fact the\nmaster of the feast testified, when he called the bridegroom, and said unto him, “Every man\nmaketh the wine which is good to be drunk first of all, and when [the priests] have drunk\nfreely, he giveth them wine which is inferior to drink; but thou hast kept back the good till\nthe last, even unto this moment.”  And in that place His glory appeared, and His disciples\nbelieved on Him.\nAnd on this day the Seven Children whose names are ‘Arsalidas, Duamedos (Diomedis),\nEugenius, Demetrius, Bernatius, Stephen and Irakos (Cyriacus); these men were sons of\nnobles of the city who were strong in the Faith of Christ.   And it was reported unto the\nwicked Emperor Decius that they were Christians, and he had them brought to him, and he\npressed them to worship his idols; and when they refused to do so he appointed them a time\nwherein they could take counsel together about the matter, and Decius went to his palace. \nAnd these Seven blessed Children went to their houses, and they distributed all their goods\namong the poor and needy, and the dinars which were left they took with them for their\nnecessities, and they [went and] hid themselves in a cave to the east of the city.   And\nDuameyosis, a young man of wisdom and understanding, used to go on errands for them in\nthe city, and buy their food for them, and he told them the talk which he heard.  When the\nEmperor Decius returned to the city he sought the Seven Children, and when the people told\nhim that they were in a cave, he commanded the soldiers to block up the mouth of the cave\nwith stones.  And when these holy Children fell asleep in the evening God took their souls\nand made them to rest in the Garden, and they slept for three hundred and seventy-two years. \nAnd there were two faithful servants of the emperor whose names were Therodore and\nMacedonius, and they took two tablets of lead and wrote upon them the memorial of the\nsaints, and placed them at the mouth of the cave.  And after the Emperor Decius died, many\nemperors reigned.  And in the days of Theodosius, the spiritual emperor, there rose up certain\nheretical men who denied the resurrection of the dead.  And there was a certain nobleman\nwhose name was Aldius, and he wanted to build a pen for his sheep, and he commanded the\nworkmen to bring stones for this purpose.  And they opened the cave, and those saints woke\nup, and they sent Duamedos (Diomedis) to buy food for them.  And when the men of the city\nsaw that the dinar was inscribed with the name of Decius, they seized Duamedos (Diomedis),\nthinking that he had found a buried treasure.  And they brought him before the magistrates\nand the bishop, and when they examined him he told them about the young men; and when\nthey had gone there they found them seated and sending forth rays of light like the sun.  And\nthe bishop took the lead tablets and read their history which was written upon them, and\nwhen [the magistrates] heard that they had fallen asleep in the days of Decius they marveled\nand glorified God.  And they sent a message to Theodosius the emperor, and when he arrived\nhe saluted the saints, and was blessed by them.  And having conversed with him, and blessed\nhim, they fell asleep on the ground and delivered up their souls to God; and the Emperor\nTheodosius wept over them and buried them in that place.  Salutation to the Seven Sleepers.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Karnos (Carinus) the martyr, and Minas of the cell\n(i.e. the anchorite).\nAnd on this day also died Abba Nakaro.  This holy man was a spiritual fighter, but no man\nknew it.  He used to put thorns under his shirt so that he might not sleep soundly, and he kept\n\nvigil by day and by night, and because of his excessive humility they made him a\ndoorkeeper.  And there was in that monastery a certain monk, an anchorite, who was able to\nsee hidden things by the spirit.  One night in his sleep he saw that he was standing on a high\nplace, and below him was a garden [filled with] fruits of all kinds, and streams of water ran\nround about through it, and in the midst of them was Abba Nakaro, watering this plot and\nthat.   And that monk said unto him, “O my brother Nakaro, Unto whom belongeth this\ngarden?”  And Nakaro said unto him, “I planted it.”  And the monk said unto Nakaro, “I wish\nthee to give me some of the fruits thereof.”  Then Nakaro cut off three pomegranates, and\ngave them to him, and he tied them up in his garment; and when he awoke from his sleep he\nfound the fruit.  And he went to Abba Nakaro and he found him standing in the doorway, and\nhe said unto him, “O my brother, hast thou seen me this [past] night?”  And Nakaro said unto\nhim, “Yea, I saw thee, and I gave thee three pomegranates.”  And when the monk went into\nthe monastery he told the monks and the abbot everything which had happened, and he\nshowed them the pomegranates, and the brethren marveled at the holiness of Abba Nakaro,\nfor it was then summer time, and not the season for pomegranates.  And the monks were\nsorry that they had appointed Abba Nakaro to such a lowly position as that of doorkeeper,\nand they wanted to give him a higher position; but when they went to him they could not find\nhim, and they sorrowed for him with a great sorrow.  And the pilgrims told them that he died\nas on this day.  Salutation to the blessed Abba Nakaro.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

her father was a priest and his\nname was John, and [the name of] her mother was Hilaria.   They had no children, and\nbecause of this were very sad, and they prayed to God, and after they had waited some days,\nHilaria was rewarded with a beautiful daughter, whom she named “Mehrael.”  And when the\nmaiden was twelve years old she began to work many signs and wonders, by the grace of the\nHoly Spirit, which dwelt upon her.  And then when the wicked Diocletian was reigning she\nwent out one day to the river bank, and she found a ship and she embarked in it, and she\ndeparted with those who were going to martyrdom.  When she arrived at the city of ‘Ensna\n(Esnah), they set her before the governor, whose name was Philipianus.  And when he saw\nher, he had pity on her for her tender body, and he wanted to set her free; but as soon as she\nknew that he was going to release her, she cursed him with great boldness, and reviled his\nunclean gods.   Therefore was the governor wroth, and he commanded her to be tortured\nseverely.  When he could not persuade her to abandon the True Faith, he commanded the\nhunters to collect all kinds of serpents, and scorpions, and vipers, and reptiles which sting,\nand to throw them into a corn sack and to put the saint into the sack with them; and the\nsoldiers did so.  Thereupon the angel of God appeared, and gave her a promise; and after this\nshe delivered up her soul, and finished her martyrdom, and received her heavenly crown. \nThen they took her out of the corn sack and buried her in that place.  When her father and\nmother heard of it, they set out with very many natives of their city, and when they arrived at\nthe place where her body was, they took it up, and made it ready for burial with great honor,\nand they built over her a shrine, inside the house, in a secret place, and many miracles were\nmade manifest there.\nAnd on this day also four and forty soldiers of the company of Saint Cyriacus [and Julitta]\nbecame martyrs.  [The Bodleian MS. has five thousand four hundred and thirty-four.]\nAnd on this day also died the holy father and spiritual fighter Archilides.  This holy man was\none of the patricians of Rome; the name of his father was John, and that of his mother\nSandalika.  And they both were righteous before God, and they walked in the commandments\nof God without blemish.  And when the days of Saint Archilides were twelve years, his father\ndied, and his mother wanted to marry him to a wife, but he did not wish this.  And his mother\nadvised him to go to the emperor, so that he might receive the office which his father had\nheld, and she sent two of his servants with him, and also many gifts to give to the emperor. \nAnd when they were on the sea a mighty storm of wind broke on them, and the waves rose\nhigh, and the ship was broken in pieces, but Saint Archilides hung on to one of the planks of\nthe ship and it carried him to dry land.  And when he was going up from the sea he found the\ndead body of a man which had been cast into the sea, and he sat down and wept over it and\nremembered the transience of the world.  And he rebuked his soul, and said unto it, “What\nhave you and I to do with the goods of this fleeting world?  After I am dead I shall return to\ndust.”  And straightway he rose up and prayed, and entreated the Lord Christ that he might\ngo in the right way, and then he walked on and arrived at a monastery of the country of Syria,\nwhich was built in the name of Saint Romanus.  And he gave to the abbot the two hundred\ndinars in gold which he had left, and he begged him to array him in the garb of the monastic\nlife; now the Holy Spirit had told the abbot about Archilides before his arrival, and when he\ncame he rejoiced in him with a great joy.  And he gathered together all the holy brethren and\nmonks in the church, and the abbot prayed over Saint Archilides, and he arrayed him in the\ngarb of the monk, and the brethren rejoiced in him with a great joy, because, manifestly, the\ngrace of God was upon him.  And Saint Archilides, having become a monk, devoted himself\n\nto the narrow way, and he fought a great fight.  And he always fasted seven days at a time,\nand he prayed day and night, and God gave him the gift of healing the sick; and the people\nbrought unto him all those that were sick, [and he prayed] over them and healed them.  And\nhe made a covenant with our Lord Christ that he would never look upon the face of a\nwoman.  And being without information concerning him for a period of twelve years, and not\nknowing what had become of him, his mother sorrowed for him, and thought that he was\ndead; and she mourned for him greatly.  And she built a fine house for receiving strangers,\nand she added to it a house wherein the pilgrims, and the poor, and the needy, might lodge;\nand she herself lived in an upper room of the house for strangers (i.e. her guest house).  And\none day she heard certain travelers talking among themselves about the fame of Saint\nArchilides, and his holiness, and his spiritual fight, and the grace of God which was upon\nhim, and they also described his miracles and the beauty of his appearance.  And when she\nheard them talking, her heart burned like fire, and she knew that they were talking about her\nson, and they told her all about him, and she knew that her beloved son was alive.  And she\nrose up straightway and traveled until she came to the monastery of Saint Romanus, and she\nsent a message to her son Archilides and said, “Behold, I have arrived, and I wish to see thy\nface; I am thy mother.”  And he sent a message unto her, saying, “I have made a covenant\nwith my Lord Jesus Christ that I will never look upon the face of a woman again, and I\ncannot break the covenant which I have made with my Lord Jesus Christ.”  Then she sent a\nsecond message unto him wherein she begged and entreated him that she might see his face,\nand she said unto him, “If thou dost not show me thy face I will go into the desert, and the\nwild beasts shall devour me.”  And when Saint Archilides knew that she would not leave\nhim, and he, on his part, was unable to break his covenant with God, straightway he prayed\nto God and asked Him to receive his soul.   And he said unto the gatekeeper, “Go to my\nmother, and let her come in to me”;  now God had accepted his prayer and heard his petition,\nand had taken his holy soul.  And when his mother came in she found that he had delivered\nup his soul, and she cried out with a loud voice and wept; then she asked God to take her\nsoul, and He heard her petition also and took her soul.  And when the monks wanted to make\nthem ready for burial they tried to separate the body of Saint Archilides from the body of his\nmother, but a voice came from the body of Saint Archilides, saying, “Bury my body with the\nbody of my mother in one grave; I did not give her heart’s desire; let her see me.”  When they\nheard this voice they marveled exceedingly and glorified God, and they buried the two of\nthem in one grave.  And God made manifest from his body a great power for the healing of\nall sick folk.\nAnd on this day also Saint ‘Emrais became a martyr.  This blessed maiden had honorable\nparents who held firmly the Faith of Christ, and she was brought up in the fear of God.  And\none day when she was going down to the river to draw water, she saw the bishops, priests,\nand deacons who were bound in fetters for Christ’s sake.  And she asked the scribe to write\nher name down with theirs, and they brought her to Quilquilianus the wicked governor, and\nhe persuaded her with many words to worship idols.   And when she refused to do so he\ncommanded the soldiers to cut off her head, [and they did so,] and she finished her\nmartyrdom with all those who were her companions.\nAnd on this day also died Maximus, the brother of Saint Damatheus.  And behold we have\nwritten the account of his strife with that of his brother in the section for the seventeenth day\nof the month of Ter.\nSalutation to the blessed Mehrael who finished her martyrdom in a corn sack; and salutation\nto her brother.\nSalutation to Archilides who was buried with his mother.\nSalutation to ‘Emrais, who left her water-jar, and joined the company of fettered men who\nwere to become martyrs.\nSalutation to Maximus who fought the spiritual fight from his youth up.\nSalutation to ‘Abdeyu, the follower of Elijah.\n\nSalutation to the four thousand and thirty and four soldiers who asked that they might be\nbeheaded outside the city.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and\nhe made strong the people of Israel, and rebuked them often.  And he was the third captain\nwhom Ahab sent with fifty men to summon Elijah to him.  Now, fire having come down from\nheaven, and burnt up the two captains who preceded him, and the men who were with them,\nat the word of Elijah the prophet, when ‘Abdeyu (Obadiah) came to him he did not behave\nwith arrogance or show himself proud like the two captains who came before him.  But he\nwas humble, and he came to Elijah the prophet, and knelt down upon his knees before him,\nand he asked him not to destroy him, like the two captains and the men who came before\nhim, and those who were with him.   And when he said this Elijah the prophet had\ncompassion upon him, and he came down and went to Ahab with him.  And after Elijah came\ndown and went with him [to Ahab], this just man knew within himself that the service of\nElijah was greater and more honourable than the service of the kings of the earth, and that the\nservice of Elijah appertained to the service of the King of heaven; and he forsook the service\nof King Ahab and followed Elijah the prophet, and ministered unto him.   And the grace of\nGod descended upon him, and prophecy, and the power to prophesy; and all the days of his\nprophesying were twenty years and more, and he prophesied nine hundred years before the\ncoming of our Lord.  And he died in peace and was buried in the tomb of his fathers in the\nfield which was known as Bet Kherum.\nAnd on this day also the Christians of the country of Syria celebrate the festival of the death\nof Saint Gregory.  This father Gregory was perfect with his fathers in every virtue, both of\nmind and body.  He learned all science and doctrine, and he was very wise, and he was well\nacquainted with the language and writings of the Greeks, and he was exceedingly zealous in\nthe True Faith.  And all these things being perfect in him, and being of a good disposition,\n[the bishops and priests] elected him against his will, and made him Bishop of the city of\nNaksesa, which is Daset.  And he protected the flock of God over which he was set, and he\nillumined their souls and minds with his discourses, and his wise exhortations, and his\nrebukes; and he translated (or, interpreted) the Old and New Testaments.   And when the\nEmperor Theodosius assembled the Council of One Hundred and Fifty Bishops in the city of\nConstantinople because of Macedonius, the infidel, who was Archbishop of the city of\nConstantinople, this father was one of those who gathered together to the Council.  And he\nput to shame the infidels Sabellius, and Macedonius, and Apollinarius; and behold their\ndenial is written in the section for the first day of the month of Yakatit.   And this father\ndestroyed the schism of those infidels, and he cut through with the sword of his eloquence\nthe devices of the heretics.  And he departed in peace with the General Council, and with\nthose vanquished men and those infidels who had been put to shame.  And he arrived at a\ngood old age and he pleased God and died in peace.  And behold, we have written the rest of\nhis history in the section for the twenty-first day of the month, which is the day of his death\naccording to the Egyptians.\nAnd on this day also died Peter, and Sophia, and ‘Admira, and Isaac.\nAnd on this day also were martyred Saint Cyriacus and Julitta his mother, and eleven\nthousand four hundred and thirty-four men in the days of Alexander, the governor.   And\nJulitta was a God-fearing woman from her youth, and hearing that a persecution had broken\nout, she took to flight through fear of the governor, and she came to the country of Terses, in\n\nCelicia, and she dwelt there.  And the governor came into that city seeking for Christians,\nand the guards seized her and took her to the governor, and told him that she was a\nChristian.  And the governor, said unto her, “Offer sacrifice to the gods.”  And she said unto\nhim, “I will not offer sacrifice to unclean gods, but only to my Lord Jesus Christ.”  And the\ngovernor said unto her, “O woman, tell me of what nation thou art, and where thy city is, and\nwhat thy name is.”  And Saint Julitta said unto him, “As for my nation (or, people) [my father\nwas] Isawiros, the chief of the people of the city of Nikyos, I am a rich and noble woman,\nand my name is ‘Julitta.’  Behold I am in thy power now, but assuredly I will not sacrifice to\nunclean [gods].”  And the governor said unto her, “Offer sacrifice so that thou mayest not die\nunder severe torture.”  And she said unto him, “If thou art pleased to do this, send men into\nthe city, and let them search there for a boy three years old, and let them bring him to thee,\nand he shall tell us whom we are to serve and worship.”   And the governor sent men to\nsearch for a boy three years old, and they found the boy Cyriacus, who was three years old,\nless three months.  And they took him to the governor, saying, “We think that this boy will\nnot fail to speak, for his is of Christian origin.”  And when the governor saw that the boy was\nhandsome, and of goodly appearance, he said unto him, “O handsome boy, rejoice!”  And the\nboy said unto him, “Joy is with me, but joy is not with thee.  God saith, There is no joy for\nthe wicked.”  And the governor said unto him, “What is thy name?  Tell me that thou mayest\nnot die.”   And the boy said unto him, “I am a Christian, and my baptismal name is\nCyriacus.”  And the governor said unto him, “Sacrifice to the gods, so that I may honor thee,\nand give thee money.”  And the boy said unto him, “Get thee far from me, O messenger of\nSatan, and enemy of Righteousness.”   And when the governor heard this he became\nexceedingly angry, and he commanded the soldiers to carry him away and to beat him with\nfifty stripes; [and they did so] until his blood flowed like water.  And when Saint Julitta saw\nthe endurance of her son she gave thanks to God.  Then the governor commanded them to\nbring salt and mustard, and to open the nostrils of the boy and thrust these things into them. \nThen the boy cried out and said, “Thy word is sweeter to my throat than honey and sugar,\nyea, sweet to my mouth.”  And the governor then commanded them to bring fourteen sharp,\nred-hot rods, and to thrust seven of them into the body of his mother, and seven into the body\nof Cyriacus, two in his ears, two in his eyes, two in his nostrils and one in his heart; but by\nthe Will of God the fire was extinguished and the rods became like frozen snow.  Then the\ngovernor commanded them to shut him up in the prison house and to be bound with fetters. \nAnd as Cyriacus was praying there, Satan came unto him in the form of an angel to lead him\nastray; but when the boy made the sign of the Cross over him Satan disappeared like smoke. \nThen the governor commanded a blacksmith to make terrifying instruments of torture\nwherewith to torture the boy and his mother.  When Satan knew that Cyriacus was eager to\nreceive the crown [of martyrdom], he entered into the heart of the governor and made him\ndumb.  Then the boy said unto the blacksmith, “Couldst thou make for me some instruments\nof torture which are more hurtful than those wherewith they have been torturing me?”  And\nthe blacksmith said unto him, “I can.”  And the boy said, “Make me two knives as sharp as\nrazors, each a cubit long, and make me instruments to break the head, and twist the neck, and\npierce the ears, and [separate] the members, and scrape the sides; and [make me] a brass\ncrusher, and an instrument for pulling out the sinews and muscles; and make me three\npointed stakes, as long as I am high, and write on them, saying, ‘The Holy Trinity, which is\nneither divided nor separated from those who call upon it.’ And make me an instrument for\ntwisting [the neck], and a saw, and a frying-pan, and a cauldron, and a wheel, and a roller,\nand a bender of the neck; and an iron hook wherewith to draw out what is in the belly.  These\nare the instruments wherewith I would be tortured.”  And when the blacksmith heard these\nthings he marveled, and was silent, and he and his disciples (i.e. workmen), the blacksmiths\nof the city, finished them in forty days (?).  And the governor commanded his servants to\nshave the head of Cyriacus with a razor, and to pour red-hot coals upon it, and they did so. \nAnd they drove four rods through his shoulders and straight down his body, to the soles of\nhis feet.  And the angel of God came and removed from him the pains of the tortures.  And\nthey also cast him into a [boiling] cauldron and kept him there from dawn to the seventh\nhour, but they were unable to cause him pain; and then our Lord appeared unto him, and\ncomforted him.  And the governor said unto the boy, “If thou wouldst perform a miracle take\nup my sandal, and make it to live.”  And when the boy had prayed, the sandal turned into a\ngreat bull, out of the neck of which went forth a kid, and they killed it, and eleven thousand\n\nand four men ate of it.  And the governor was wroth, and he ordered the soldiers to cut out\nthe boy’s tongue, [and they did so] and brought back to him the tongue.  And the governor\ncommanded them to bring a red-hot cauldron and to cast him into it; and when Julitta saw\nthis she was afraid.  And her son prayed, and God gave him divine power to such a degree\nthat she and her son went into it and came out there from alive and uninjured.   And the\ngovernor also commanded the soldiers to cast them into a machine, and to drag them about\nwith ropes so that the flesh might be torn off their bodies, [and they did so], until the angel of\nGod came and delivered them.   And when the governor found that he was unable [to\nvanquish] them, he commanded the soldiers to cut off their heads with the sword.  And our\nLord Jesus Christ came down from heaven, and said unto the boy, “[Tell me] the things\nwhich ye wish for.”  And Cyriacus said unto Him, “Let not my body be buried on earth.  And\nwhosoever shall call upon my name, or celebrate my commemoration, or build a martyrium\nfor me, or write the book of my strife, or read it, or bring an offering into my church, or shall\npray therein, grant such their desires and forgive them their sins.”  And our Redeemer said\nunto him, “Everything which thou hast asked of Me I will give thee, and thou shalt be with\nMe on My right hand, and I will set thy body in the chariot of Elijah.”  And when the boy\nheard this he rejoiced greatly, and he gave thanks to God and was crowned with his mother\nduring the night, and our Redeemer crowned him with incorruptible crowns, and took his\nsoul up with Him, in glory which is indescribable and inexplicable.  Salutation to Cyriacus.\nSalutation to Gregorius who was present at the Council of One Hundred and Fifty Bishops in\nConstantinople.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

And he cursed the infidel emperor, and his unclean gods, until they smote\nhim on the mouth, and cut out his tongue and broke his teeth; and when they had done all\nthese things to him he would not hearken to the voice of the emperor.  Then the emperor\nbegan to persuade him, and to use words of blandishment and flattery to him, but Saint\nPhilotheus laughed at him, and promised that he would worship that idol; and the emperor\nrejoiced at this and imagined that he would really do so.  And he commanded his servants to\nbring Apollo, and the men and priests of the idols, and a herald went through the city who\ncried out, saying, “Come, O all ye people, so that ye may see Philotheus worshipping\nApollo”: and all the people gathered together about the tribune.  And as they were bringing\nthe idols along the road, Saint Philotheus asked our Lord Christ that the earth might open her\n\nmouth, and swallow up the idols and their priests.  And straightway the earth opened her\nmouth and swallowed up the idols and their priests, and there was a great outcry round about;\nand when the people saw this, many of them believed on our Lord Christ.  And the emperor\nwas wroth, and he commanded the soldiers to cut off the heads of them all with the sword,\n[and they did so,] and they received the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens,\nand entered into life everlasting.  As for Saint Philotheus, when the emperor was tired of\ntorturing him he commanded them to cut off his head with the sword, and he received the\ncrown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.\nAnd on this day died the holy father Palladius, the fighter.  This saint lived for fifty years in\nhis cell without going outside of it, and he never looked upon the face of a woman.  And the\ngift of prophecy and the power to work signs and wonders were given unto him in such a\nremarkable degree, that his fame was heard all through the country.  And there was a certain\nmerchant in the city of Mesr (Cairo), and he departed to make a journey in a ship, and the\nwaves rose up and were about to sink the ship.  And when hope failed, this merchant cried\nout, saying, “I take refuge in the prayer of Abba Palladius; if ever I escape from this death I\nwill give him one hundred dinars”; and straightway he saw Saint Palladius steering the ship\nwith his cross, and he brought it into port.  And when the merchant arrived in the city he took\none hundred dinars, and hired a horse and set out to go to Abba Palladius.  And when evening\nfell upon him he arrived at a certain city, and he took up his abode in the guest house, and he\nfound there a man whose name was Morik, and he told him everything which was in his\nheart.  And Morik said unto him, “I know his place, and I will bring thee to him.”  And on the\nfollowing day the two of them set out, and they came to Abba Palladius, and saluted him, and\nthe merchant gave him the gold which he had brought with him, and spread it out before\nhim.  And Abba Palladius looked at it and blessed him; and said unto him, “I have no need of\nthis gold.  Go and distribute it among the poor and needy so that thou mayest gain usury\nfrom it before God.”  When the merchant heard this he fell down at his feet and begged and\nentreated him to accept it as a gift.  When Saint Palladius saw that he made most earnest\nentreaty to him, he took one dinar, and said unto him, “I will accept this from thee as a\nblessing; as for the rest, do as I command thee, and distribute it among the poor.”   And\nhaving taken the gold the merchant buried it in the ground.  And when he came to the river,\nSatan entered into the heart of Morik, and he wanted to take the merchant’s money; and he\nleaped upon the merchant in anger and killed him.  Then he carried away the dead body by\nnight, and cast it down at the door of Abba Palladius.  And on the following day he went to\nthe governor and told him about the murder.   When the governor came, he bound Abba\nPalladius in strong fetters, and he questioned him about the dead man, and Palladius said, “I\ndid not kill him.”  And when they brought him to the coffin containing the body, he took hold\nof the body and prayed for a long time, and he said, “I command thee, O dead body, in the\nName of God to rise up and to declare who it was that killed thee.”  And the dead man rose\nup and said that Morik had killed him for his money.  When the governor saw this miracle he\nbowed down before Abba Palladius, and he was dismayed because he had entreated him\nevilly; and intending to kill Morik he released Palladius.   And having fought strenuously\nPalladius died at a good old age.\nAnd on this day also fifteen hundred soldiers [or, ten thousand five hundred] and their three\nprefects who were companions of Saint Philotheus became martyrs.\nAnd on this day also two thousand and four soldiers [or, ten thousand four hundred] who\nwere companions of Saint Cyriacus, and his mother Julitta became martyrs.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated the blessed Saint Sahma, one of the Nine Saints, who\nfought a good fight, and pleased God.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father, the pure virgin, John, the forty-eighth Archbishop\nof the city of Alexandria.  This father became a monk in his early years in the church of Saint\nAbba Macarius, in the desert of Scete; and he fought a great fight and devoted himself to\nfasting, and prayer, and vigil, and God elected him, and the Archbishop Abba Michael made\nhim a priest in the church of Saint Minas the martyr, and he gave to him all his money and\nhis land as a gift, and the votive offerings which the people brought to the church, and he\n\nfollowed peacefully a right course in that church.  When Abba Minas, the archbishop who\npreceded him, died, the bishops, and priests, and learned men gathered together in the city of\nAlexandria to elect an archbishop, and they wrote down on pieces of paper the names of\nseveral men.  And a certain righteous man said, “Why did ye make Saint John administrator\nof the church of Saint Minas?”  And they all said, “Verily he is worthy of this office.”  And\none wrote his name on a piece of paper, which was thrust in among the other pieces of paper,\nand they laid them on the altar; and they continued in prayer and the singing of hymns for\nthree days and three nights.  And they brought a child from the church, and he drew a paper\nfrom among the papers, and they found that the name of this saint was written upon it.  Then\nthy took that paper and thrust it in again among the other papers, and they brought another\nchild, and he also drew that paper; and when a third child was brought he drew that same\npaper, and the name of this saint was found to be written upon it.  Then straightway they\nknew that God had chosen him for his office, and they seized him and against his will they\nmade him Archbishop of the city of Alexandria.  And having been appointed he protected his\nflock, and he read to them frequently the Books of God, and he confirmed them in the doing\nof good in the True Faith, and his charities and alms to all men were very many.  In his days a\ngreat famine took place in the land of Egypt, and they sold one measure of grain for two\ndinars in gold, and each day many poor folk of every nationality gathered together at the door\nof his house, asking for food.  And he put his disciple Mark in charge of the money of the\nchurch, and he gave to all the poor what they needed both morning and evening, until God\nremoved His wrath from men.  And this father built many churches, and adorned them with\nsuitable adornments.  And because of the numerous works of charity which he carried out,\nand his alms and his gifts, this father was called “John the Merciful.” and indeed he was\nmerciful to the poor, and the wretched, and the widows and the orphans.  When the day of his\ndeath drew nigh, he told the priests the day whereon he would die.  And he said unto them, “I\nwas born on the sixteenth of Ter, and I was named archbishop on that day, and on that day I\nshall die”; and when he told the bishops this they wept, and they said unto him, “Our father,\nwho will be appointed archbishop over us after thee?”  And he said unto them, “Mark the\npriest, my servant, for our Lord Jesus Christ hath elected him to this office.”  And on the\nsixteenth day of the month of Ter this father died, having sat as archbishop for twenty-three\nyears.  In his days died David who had been made Archbishop of the city of Antioch by\nforce, and his predecessor George, having passed ten years in prison, was appointed.  When\nthis father was appointed Abba John wrote to him an Epistle on the True Faith, and when\nAbba George died a certain just man whose name was Yarikos was appointed in his stead. \nAnd he wrote a letter and sent it to Abba John, who received him in the Holy Spirit, and\nrejoiced in his letter, and sent to him an answer to the same.\nAnd on this day also died Mar Daniel, the Syrian, of the city of ‘Amed.  The father of this\nsaint was rich in gold and silver, and when his father died Abba Dionysius, Bishop of the city\nof ‘Amed, brought him up, and taught him the Books of the Church, and then made him a\ndeacon and priest, and arrayed him in the garb of the monastic life.   And Mar Daniel\ncontinued in fasting and prayer, and he never ate food between one Sabbath and the next, and\nat length the gift of healing was bestowed upon him; and he made a vow to himself that he\nwould never look upon a woman.  When his mother heard of the report of him she came to\nhim, and wished to see him, and when she sent a message to him he said unto her, “I have\nmade a vow that I will never look upon a woman.”   And she said unto him, “I am thy\nmother.   Why dost thou treat me like other women?”   When he refused [to see] her, she\npulled off her veil and cursed him, saying, “God maketh me to see thee laughing, and two\nwomen wrapped up in a single garment shall look upon thee.”  After a few days a certain\nman took three hundred dinars of gold to give them to Mar Daniel, and in the evening, when\nhe arrived at the gate of the cell of the saint, his companion rose up against him, and slew\nhim through his love of money.  When the King of ‘Amed heard the story about a dead man\nbeing found at the door of Mar Daniel, he commanded [his soldiers] to bring the saint before\nhim.  And when the women who were bathing in the bath-house heard the story about Mar\nDaniel, two of them rushed out to see him, and because of their great haste they had only a\nsingle garment to cover them both.   And Abba Daniel laughed when he knew that his\nmother’s curse had come upon him.  When the king questioned him about the dead man Saint\nDaniel said unto him, “I did not kill him”; and through the prayer of Abba Daniel the dead\n\nman rose up and declared who had killed him.  When the king and all the people saw this,\nthey worshipped the God of Saint Daniel and they killed the murderer.  Then the king gave\nunto Abba Daniel much money, and when he refused to accept it he built a monastery for\nhim, and many monks gathered together therein.   And then growing old and fighting\nstrenuously, he became a little sick, and he died in peace.  Salutation to Daniel who vowed\nthat he would never look upon a woman.\nSalutation to Julitta, the mother of Cyriacus.  Salutation to the five thousand martyrs who\nsuffered with Cyriacus.\nSalutation to Philotheus.  Salutation to the fifteen hundred soldiers and their three prefects,\nthe companions of Philotheus, who suffered martyrdom.\nSalutation to Palladius, and two-fold salutation to his disciple Theophilus.\nSalutation to John, the revealer of mysteries.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

And they came to Saint ‘Agabius, and revealed to him their minds, and he\narrayed them in the garb of the monastic life, and they lived with him until he died.  Before\nhis death he spoke unto them, and told them that he had seen a vision wherein Saint Abba\nMacarius the Great came to him, and said unto him, “Command these two young men\nMaximus and Dumatheus to come to me in the desert of Scete, and they shall be my sons\nbefore thy death.”  And Abba ‘Agabius told them what he had seen, and he said unto them,\n“O my sons, I have long had the desire to see this father Macarius in the flesh, and behold, I\nhave seen him in the spirit.”  And he said, “After my death go ye to him.”  And when he was\ndead they dwelt in the land of Syria, and God gave unto them the gift of healing the sick. \nAnd the report of them was heard in all countries through the merchants who traveled by sea\nand by land.  And the saints learned to make the roofs (i.e. awnings) of ships, and they lived\nupon a small part of what they earned by the labor of their hands, and the rest they gave away\nto the poor and the needy.  And by reason of the multitude of the signs and wonders which\nGod performed by their hands, many of those who were possessed by many [evil] spirits,\nwere cured immediately they heard the names of Saints Maximus and Dumatheus, by the\nmight of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And there was a very large snake which lived near the high\nroad, and it destroyed very many men, and some of the men of the city came to Saints\nMaximus and Dumatheus, and asked them to deliver them from that venomous serpent.  And\nAbba Maximus took a sheet of paper and wrote upon it as follows:  “In the Name of Jesus\nChrist, our Lord, the Word of the Father, God of hosts, the God of Abba Macarius, the\nblessed, and our honourable father ‘Agabius, who was indued with the Spirit, the holy priest,\nwhen this paper cometh to the door of thy cave, thou shalt go forth and shalt die, and the\nfowls of heaven shall devour thee.”  And a certain man took that paper and laid it at the door\nof the den of that serpent, and straightway it came forth and died; and all the people marveled\nexceedingly and they glorified God.  And God performed very many signs and wonders by\nthe hands of Maximus and Dumatheus.  One day a certain nobleman went out to his father,\n\nwho was near the sea-shore, and looking up at the awning of one of the ships, he saw written\nthereon the names of Maximus and Dumatheus, and he asked the captain of the ship, saying,\n“What are these names?”  And the captain answered and said unto him, “These are [the name\nof] two holy monks and brothers, and because of my confidence in them I have written their\nnames upon the awning of my ship, so that God may save me from sinking in the sea through\ntheir prayers.”  And the nobleman said unto him, “What are they like in person?”  And the\ncaptain said unto him, “One is perfect, and the other hath no beard”; and then the nobleman\nknew that the young men were the sons of the emperor.  And he took that merchant and\nbrought him to the emperor, the father of the saints, and he asked him about his sons; and the\ncaptain told them what they were like, and everyone knew that they were indeed his sons. \nAnd he sent their mother and their sister to them, and when they came to them, with many\nsoldiers, and saw them, they cried out and wept freely and embraced them; and their mother\nasked them to come to her and to their father the emperor.  And they said unto her, “We\ncannot destroy [our] covenant with God, for we have vowed ourselves to God, and we pray\nfor thee and for our father, by night and by day, that God will deliver you from all harm.” \nAnd with these words they consoled her, and she left them and returned sad and sorrowful,\nand she wept because she was to be separated from them; and she told the emperor and the\nsoldiers what had happened to them.  And the emperor said unto his wife and his soldiers,\n“Let them alone so that they may become treasure with our God and Lord Jesus Christ, and\nmay make entreaty to Him for us in their prayers; for everything which is in this world, and\nthe glory thereof, passeth away like a dream, and they will gain a kingdom which doth not\npass away.”  And in those days the Archbishop of the city of Rome died, and the bishops and\nall the priests gathered together so that they might take counsel and appoint an archbishop. \nAnd they remembered the blessed Maximus, and they said, “Verily this man is well fitted for\nthis office, for God hath given unto him the great gift of healing the sick, and God hath\nwrought many signs and wonders by his hands.   And although he is young in days, still\nChrist dwelleth in him, and he is perfect in knowledge and in good works, and in all the Law\nof the Church.”  When his father and mother heard this they rejoiced exceedingly, and they\nsent certain officers together with their troops, and they sent with them a letter which they\nhad written to the governor of the country of Syria commanding him to send Maximus and\nDumatheus to the city of Rome.  When the saints heard this they were exceedingly sorry, and\nthey remembered what their father, the monk Abba ‘Agabius, had commanded them.  And\nthey rose up straightway, and they changed their apparel, and they departed, not knowing\nwhere they were going, and they wandered to the shore of the Red Sea.  And being athirst\nGod changed that bitter water and made it sweet for them, and He sent forth power from\nHim, and it carried them from the country of Syria and brought them to the desert of Scete;\nand they came to Saint Abba Macarius, and told him that they wished to dwell with him. \nAnd when he saw that they were sons of grace, he thought that they would not be able to live\nin the desert, and he told them about the difficulty of the desert, saying, “Ye will not be able\nto dwell here.”  And they answered and said unto him, “O our father, if we cannot live here\nwe will go away.”  Then he taught them how to plait palm fiber, and he showed them a valley\nwherefrom they could obtain the palm leaves, and he helped them until they had built a cell\nfor themselves.  And he brought to them a certain native to buy from them the objects which\nthey made with their hands, and he brought them bread.  And they lived in this way in the\ndesert for three years, and they held converse with none, for they would go into the church\nholding their peace, and received the Holy Mysteries, and return to their cell.  And our father\nSaint Macarius wondered at their behavior and why they had neither come to him nor visited\nhim during this period of three years; and he asked God to reveal the matter of them to him. \nAnd he rose up and went to them, and they rejoiced in him exceedingly, and he dwelt with\nthem that night.  And when he rose up to pray he saw Saints Maximus and Dumatheus rise\nup to pray, and when they prayed he saw as it were a rope of fire which went up from their\nmouths to heaven.  And Satans thronged about them like flies, and the angel of God drove\n\nthem away from them with a sword of fire.  When the morning had come he arrayed them in\nthe garb of the angels, and he departed from them, saying, “Pray for me”; and they bowed\nlow before him, saying, “Bless us, O our father, and pray for us.”   And when they had\nfinished their fight, and God wished to give them rest from the labor and sorrow of this\nworld, Maximus fell sick of fever and his body became like fire.  And he sent a message to\nAbba Macarius asking him to come and see him, and when Macarius arrived he found him\nsick.  And Maximus said unto him, “Bless me, O my father”; and he blessed him, and said\nunto him, “Fear not, for this illness shall depart from thee.”  And Maximus said unto him, “O\nmy father, I know that this day I shall depart from this poor body of mine; I ask thee to pray\nfor me, and I shall find help”; and having said these words he wept bitterly.  And at that\nmoment Abba Macarius saw the Company of the Saints, Prophets and Apostles, and John the\nBaptist, and the Emperor Constantine, and they came and surrounded Saint Maximus, until\nhis soul went forth in honor and glory.  And Abba Macarius wept and said, “Blessed art thou,\nMaximus.”   And Dumatheus wept bitterly for his brother, and he asked Abba Macarius,\nsaying, “Pray for me that God may take my soul and bring me to my brother.”  And three\ndays after Saint Maximus was buried, Dumatheus fell sick, and one told Saint Macarius\nabout him, and he rose up to go to him.  And as he was journeying along the road, he saw the\nsaints, and he saw the Company, who came and received the soul of Saint Maximus, take the\nsoul of his brother Dumatheus, and carry it up to heaven.  And when Abba Macarius arrived\nat their cell he found Dumatheus dead, and he took him and buried him with his brother\nMaximus, in the same grave.  The death of Maximus took place on the fourteenth day of the\nmonth of Ter, and that of his brother on the sixteenth day of the month of Ter.  And Saint\nAbba Macarius commanded that monastery to be called by their names, and similarly that\nmonastery is called to this day Dabra Barmos (Baramas).   And they have everlasting\nremembrance in the kingdom of heaven, and in all the ends of the world.   Salutation to\nDumatheus and his brother Maximus.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and\ngreat tribulation came [upon him] and persecution for the Name of Christ.  And having\nfinished his fight he died at a good old age, and he pleased God and inherited the kingdom\nof heaven and everlasting joy.\nAnd on this day ‘Aklog (Eclogius) the priest became a martyr.  This saint was a man of the\ncity called “El-Neft,” in the country of Egypt, and his father’s name was Dioscorus, and\nhis mother’s name was Euphemia; they belonged to a noble family and were very rich in\ngold, and silver, and cattle, and sheep, and horses, and camels, and lands.  And they had no\nson, and were therefore very sad, and they prayed to God continually to give them a son;\nand God heard their prayer and gave them this holy son, and they called him “’Aklog”\n(Eclogius), which is, being interpreted, “pleasant to God.”  When he was eight years old\nhis parents gave him to a teacher so that he might instruct him in the Law of God, and each\nday he went to the church, and heard the praises and prayers before he went to his teacher. \nOne day he left is teacher to ride his horse, and two servants followed him.  As he was\nriding along he saw many men and women gathered together, and uttering cries, and he\nwent up to them to see [what the matter was], and he found that a child whom a serpent\nhad bitten had fallen down in their midst, and was night unto death.  And Abba ‘Aklog\n(Eclogius) cried out, and he remembered the words of the Holy Gospel which said that\nthose who believed on our Lord should make miracles manifest, that they should cast out\ndevils in His Name, that they should take up vipers in their hands and that they should not\nharm them in any way, and that they should lay their hands on the sick and heal them. \nAnd straightway he took hold of the child’s hands, and made over him the sign of the\nCross in the Name of the Father and the Son [and the Holy Spirit], and said, “O child, I tell\nthee to be healed of the bite of this wicked, lying reptile.  For our Lord saith with His pure\nand righteous mouth, ‘Behold, I have given you power to tread upon serpents and\nscorpions, and every power of the Enemy, and they shall in no wise injure you.’”  And\nstraightway the child recovered and became like one on whom no evil whatsoever had\ncome.   When the people saw this miracle they marveled exceedingly, and they praised\nGod, the Worker of miracles, by His saints; and the report of this miracle was heard in\nevery city.  And when Abba ‘Aklog (Eclogius) had arrived at his twelfth year and was still\nunder his teacher’s care, he knew by heart the Four Gospels, and the Fourteen Epistles of\nPaul, and the Seven Apostolic Epistles, and the Book of the Acts of the Apostles, and the\n\nOne Hundred and Fifty Psalms of David.  And he read each of these every night of the\nFirst Day of the week, and he devoted himself strenuously to fasting and prayer.  When the\nmen of his city saw his spiritual fight, after his parents’ death, they asked the bishop to\nappoint him their priest so that he might pray for them.  He fasted two, or three, or seven\ndays at a time, all the days of his life; and he prayed day and night; and he wore hairy\nsackcloth under his apparel next to his flesh.  And the grace of God called the blessed\n‘Aklog (Eclogius) to be a priest.  And the bishop seized him against his will, and made\nhim a priest.  And when he was being appointed the people heard a voice crying out and\nsaying, “Abba ‘Aklog (Eclogius) is worthy, is worthy, is worthy of the office of the\npriesthood”; and the people glorified God.  And after those days a great persecution of the\nChristians broke out in all the land of Egypt under Diocletian the infidel, who destroyed\nthe churches; and many people became martyrs.   And God summoned Abba ‘Aklog\n(Eclogius) to become a martyr, and he stood up and looked up into heaven, and cried out,\nsaying, “My Lord, and my God, and my Redeemer, Jesus Christ, the Sustainer of the\nUniverse, let Thy mercy and peace be over the people who are in my city everywhere, and\nbless them and deliver them from Satans, and send an angel unto me to strengthen me until\nI have finished my fight for Thy Name’s sake; for Thine is the glory and the power for\never and ever, Amen.”  When Saint ‘Aklog (Eclogius) had said this he turned to the people\nwho were round about him, and said unto them, “Whosoever loveth [me] let him come and\ngo with me”; and there followed him his own family, and slaves, and people of the city,\nthree hundred and forty men; and they stood upon a high place and they cried out loudly\nand boldly, saying, “We are Christians.”  When the captain of the emperor’s soldiers heard\nthis he was sorry, and he bound Abba ‘Aklog (Eclogius) in fetters and sent him to Arianus\nthe governor.  And Arianus said unto him, “Worship the gods of the emperor so that thou\nmayest received great honor”; and ‘Aklog (Eclogius) said unto him, “I will never worship\nunclean idols, and I will only worship my Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom belongeth glory,\nand power, and majesty.”   When Arianus heard this he condemned Saint Abba ‘Aklog\n(Eclogius) to severe torture in a red-hot oven, but God sent His angel and made the fire [as\ncool] as dew; and the saint stood up in the red-hot oven and prayed.  Then Arianus the\ngovernor said unto the hundred and forty men, “Come ye and worship the gods.”  And\nthey answered and said unto him, “We will not worship the gods, but only Jesus Christ.” \nAnd Arianus commanded the soldiers to cut off their heads with the sword, and they did\nso, and the saints received the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  And in\nthose days the son of Arianus the governor died, and he mourned for him greatly.  And\nAbba ‘Aklog (Eclogius) said unto him, “If I do good for thee, and pray to the Lord my\nGod on thy behalf that He may raise up thy son alive, what honor wilt thou bestow upon\nme?”  And Arianus said unto him, “I will make thee captain over one hundred soldiers, and\nI will send thee to thy city with great honor.”  And Saint Abba ‘Aklog (Eclogius) said unto\nhim, “I do not wish for this thing, but I want thee, when thou hast tortured me, to send my\nbody to my city; if thou wilt do this for me I will raise up thy son for thee.”  And the\ngovernor swore to him that he would do all that he wished.  And Saint ‘Aklog (Eclogius)\nprayed unto God, saying, “I beseech Thee, O my Lord Jesus Christ, to hear my petition\nthis day, and to raise up this boy from the dead, that he may glorify Thy Name for ever and\never, Amen.”  And having said this, he made the sign of the Cross over him in the Name of\nthe Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, and straightway the child rose up alive.  And\nwhen the people saw this they all cried out together, saying, “We are all Christians, and we\nbelieve in the God of Saint Abba ‘Aklog (Eclogius).”  When the governor heard this he\nwas exceedingly wroth, and he commanded the soldiers to take them outside the city, and\nto dig a large pit, and to light a large fire therein, and when the flames reached to a great\nheight, to cast them into it; and the soldiers did so, and the men finished their martyrdom\nin the peace of God.   Now they were in number eight hundred and nine souls.   And\nArianus the governor commanded the soldiers to torture Abba ‘Aklog (Eclogius) severely,\nand to send to his own country his head [after it was cut off with] the sword.  When the\nsaint heard this he rejoiced greatly, and he stood up and prayed, saying, “How [long], O\nmy Lord Jesus Christ, wilt Thou hearken unto the petition of me, Thy servant?  Let Thy\nmercy come upon my city, and upon all the men who dwell therein.  Bless the work of\ntheir hands, and bless their women, and their children, and their cattle, and their fields, and\ndeliver them from all trials and tribulations, by Thy Divine Power, O my Lord Jesus\n\nChrist.  Give Thou grace to my body, and grant that every sick person who shall come to\nmy church, and shall intercede before my body in Thy Name shall be healed of his\nsickness.  And he who writeth the book of my strife and celebrateth my commemoration,\ndo Thou write his name in the Book of Life.  When a man giveth an offering on the day of\nmy commemoration, or incense, or unguent, or oil, or wine, give Thou him his reward in\nthe kingdom of the heavens.  Whosoever shall swathe my body for burial in clean cloth, do\nThou array him in the apparel of light, for Thine is the glory and the power for ever and\never, Amen.”  And when he had said this, behold our Lord appeared unto him and said\nunto him, “Peace be unto thee, O my elect and beloved, and beloved of the Father and of\nthe Holy Spirit, Abba ‘Aklog (Eclogius), I have come unto thee, and I will give thee the\nreward of thy labor, and I will make thee to rest in My kingdom.  Three crowns have been\nprepared for thee:  one for thy virginity, one for thy torture, and one because thou hast\nrejected the world for My Name’s sake.   Come unto Me, O My beloved Abba ‘Aklog\n(Eclogius), so that I may give thee the reward of thy labor, and that I may take thee up into\nMy kingdom, and that I may do for thee everything which thou hast asked of Me this day,\nin return for what they have made thee to suffer for My Name’s sake.  I will give thee an\nabode in the kingdom of the heavens.  I will make the angel hosts to serve thee, and thou\nshalt rejoice with all the saints at My table in the life, which is forever.  Verily I say unto\nthee, O My chosen one Abba ‘Aklog (Eclogius), whosoever shall make intercession by thy\nbody, and shall seek for thine intercession because of the labor which thou hast performed\nfor My sake, if he be in tribulation, or in sickness, or in any trial and sorrow, I will deliver\nhim.   And whosoever shall call his son by thy name, that child will I bless, and rear\nhappily, and preserve from evil.  Whosoever shall give an offering to the church on the day\nof thy commemoration in thy name, to him will I bring the Bread of Life in the kingdom\nof the heavens.  Whosoever shall give a cup of cold water to a thirsty man, him will I make\nto drink from the cup of the Water of Life.  Whosoever shall plant a vineyard or sow fields\nwith grain, and pray to Me for them in thy name, I will make him grow old, and multiply\nhim, and bless him.”   And when our Lord Christ had finished His converse with the\nblessed Abba ‘Aklog (Eclogius), He made the sign of the Cross over his body, and\ndelivered it from all his toil, and He embraced him, and blessed him, and went up into\nheaven in great glory, whilst the saint was looking at Him. After this the saint turned to the\nsoldiers, and said unto them, “O my brethren, finish that which the governor hath\ncommanded you to do.”  And the soldiers, seeing that his face was shining like the sun,\nfeared greatly his majesty and his light, and they were unable to approach him.  But one of\nthem, a man dense of heart and unmerciful, stretched out his hand to the saint, and smote\nhim on the neck with the sword and cut off his holy head; and the saint finished his\nmartyrdom on the twentieth day of the month of Ter.  And the angels took his soul and\ncarried it up into heaven singing as they went.  And the soldiers left the body of the saint\non the riverbank, and they embarked in their ship and departed.  And certain young men\nwere there, and they went into the city and told the people why, and how, the martyrdom\nof Saint Abba ‘Aklog (Eclogius) took place.   And the people and the priests gathered\ntogether, and went and carried his body, with great honor and with singing of psalms and\ndirges, until they brought it to the city and laid it in a good resting place.  And great signs,\nand miracles, and healings of the sick took place through it.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Saint Behnu, the martyr; and the consecration of\nthe church of John, the possessor of the Golden Gospel, in the city of Rome, and the\ntranslation of his body thereto.  Salutation to John.\nAnd on this day the strife and martyrdom of Abba Noha (Noah) took place, and the\nmanifestation of his miracles.  And on this day also are celebrated the consecration of the\nchurch of Mar Mehnam, and also ‘Alvanus (Silvanus), and Abba Nabyud (or Nabdeyu) of\nSihat (Scete), and Anna Benwah, the martyr.\nSalutation to ‘Abrokoros (Prochorus).\nSalutation to Abba Kaluz, the martyr, of the city of Fant.\nSalutation to Abba Nabyud.\n\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

the\nHoly Spirit made known to her that she was to depart from this fleeting world, and then\ntold the virgins who were with her from Dabra Zayt, even as our Lord told them.  Then\nour Lady Mary prayed, saying, “O my Lord Jesus Christ, hearken Thou unto me, and\nunto my prayer at this time, and unto my petition, and bring unto me thy disciple, John\nthe evangelist, and likewise all Thy disciples, both those who are living and those whose\nsouls Thou hast taken, for Thou art the God of the living and of the dead, and unto Thee\nbelongeth glory for ever and ever, Amen.”  and behold a cloud straightway took up John\nin the spirit from the city of Ephesus, and brought him to our Lady the holy Virgin\nMariyam; and when he stood before her she glorified our Lord Jesus Christ.  And John\nsaid unto her, “Rejoice, O thou who art full of grace, who didst bear our Lord Jesus\nChrist.”  And the Holy Spirit spoke by his mouth, saying, “Thou shalt go forth from this\nworld with great honor and glory, and after many great signs and wonders which our\nLord and God shall make manifest by thee.”  When our holy Lady the Virgin Mariyam\nheard these words, she rejoiced exceedingly, and she prayed, saying, “Glory unto Thee, O\nmy Lord and God Jesus Christ, Who hast granted unto me what I asked.  And now, honor\nme by Thy coming with Thine angels, so that they may take my soul and bear it up with\nThee into the heavens.”  And straightway the voice of the Holy Spirit from heaven was\nheard, saying, “At this time all the angels shall come from heaven, and the Apostles from\nall the ends of the earth, riding upon the clouds, and they shall come to Bethlehem, for\nthe sake of the holy and blessed Virgin Mariyam, the mother of our Lord Jesus Christ.” \nAnd straightway all the Apostles came, for those who were dead rose up from their\ngraves, and they stood before our holy Lady the Virgin Mariyam, and said unto her,\n“Rejoice, O thou who art full of grace, for our God was born of thee.  He shall take thee\nout of this fleeting world with great glory even as He promised thee.”  And straightway\nour Lady Mariyam sat down upon her bed, and said unto the Apostles, “Now do I know\nthat my God and your God, Jesus Christ, will come to me, and that I shall see Him as I\nsee you, and then I shall depart from this world.  And now I desire you to tell me whence\nye knew that I was to depart from this world, and so hastened your coming to me.”  And\nPeter and all the Apostles said unto her, “The Holy Spirit commanded us to come unto\nthee, and straightway we mounted upon a cloud of light, and we arrived where thou art in\nthe twinkling of an eye.”  When our Lady Mariyam heard this from the Apostles, she\nlifted up her voice and said, “I praise and hymn Thy Holy Name, O my Lord Jesus Christ,\nmy God, because Thou hast seen my suffering, and hast revealed unto me wonders, for\nThou art Almighty; henceforth all generations shall hold me blessed.”   And when the\nVirgin had finished her prayer and supplications, she said unto the Apostles, “Bring me\nincense and a censer, and summon our Lord Jesus,” and they did as she commanded\nthem; and straightway our Lord Jesus Christ came.  And thousands of thousands, and tens\nof thousands of tens of thousands of angels, surrounded Him, and archangels, and our\nLord Jesus Christ comforted her, and told her of the rest and joy which were prepared for\nher.  At that moment many miracles took place; the blind received their sight, and the\ndumb spoke, and the lame stood up straight and walked, and the lepers were cleansed,\nand from those who were possessed of devils the evil spirits went forth quickly.  And all\nthose who were suffering from sicknesses of divers kinds, as soon as ever they came to\nthe place where was our holy Lady the Virgin Mariyam, were healed straightway of their\nsicknesses, no matter of whatever kinds they were.   Then our holy Lady the Virgin\nMariyam said unto her beloved Son, “O my Lord Jesus Christ, I am afraid of the awful\n\nand terrifying angels who are in the air of the Land of Fire.”  And our Lord said unto her,\n“Which of them can have dominion over thee?”  When the time for her to depart from her\nbody drew nigh, the Apostles and the virgins who were there weeping asked her to bless\nthem, and she laid her hands upon them, and blessed them.  And straightway our Lord\nChrist took her pure soul in His Divine Hands, and He wrapped it up in a cloth of light,\nand took it up with Him to the habitation above.  And her Son, our Lord, commanded the\nApostles to bury her body in a fitting manner, and they carried it to Gethsemane.  And\nbefore her soul departed, our Lady looked and saw a great light, which it is impossible for\nthe tongue of man to describe.  And our Lord Christ said unto her, “Henceforth thy body\nshall depart to the Garden of Delight, and thy soul shall dwell in the abode of joy,\nwherein the angels shall praise [God] before thee.”   And our Lady said unto Him, “I\nbeseech Thee, in the operation of Thy wisdom, to hearken unto my petition.  Whosoever\nshall pray unto Thee in my name do Thou in Thy mercy receive his petition.  Whosoever\nis in tribulation and shall pray to Thee in my name, deliver Thou him from all his\ntribulation, for Thou art Almighty in heaven and on earth.  Bless everywhere those who\nshall celebrate the commemoration of my name, and accept the offerings of all those who\nshall offer gifts in my name.”  And our Lord Jesus answered and said unto her, “Behold, I\nhave done for thee all which thou didst ask of Me.  Rejoice, for every gift and every\nhonor I will give thee from my holy Father.  And everyone who shall pray unto Me in thy\nname henceforward shall never perish, neither in this world nor in that which is to come,\nfor I will be to him a kindly intercessor with My heavenly Father.”  After our holy Lady\nthe Virgin Mariyam was dead the Apostles prepared her for burial, and they carried her\non a bier so that they might take her to Gethsemane, as our Lord commanded.  When the\nJews heard of this and they knew that it was our Lady Mariyam [on the bier], they went\nout to her, and one of them seized her bier with his hand in order to throw her off from it\non the ground; and the angel of God smote him with a sword of fire, and cut off his\nhands, and they remained hanging on the bier.  And then the Jew believed on our Lord\nChrist, and he entreated our Lady Mariyam with tears and repentance for what he had\ndone, and he wept bitterly, saying, “Verily, O pure Virgin, thou art the mother of our Lord\nJesus Christ, Thou God in truth, I beseech Thee to have compassion upon me.”  And\nthrough the prayers of the holy Apostles his hands were restored to their former\npositions.  When the Apostles had buried her they remained there three days; now her\ndeath took place on Sunday, the twenty-first day of the month of Ter.   And our Lord\nJesus sent angels of light, and they carried her body away from the grave, and laid it\nunder the Tree of Life, which is in the Garden of Delight.  Now Thomas the Apostle was\nnot present at the time of her death, but as he was coming on the cloud, he found her\nbody with the angels.  And one of the angels said unto him, “Make haste and salute the\nbody of the mother of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mariyam”; and he made haste and\nsaluted her.  And when he came to the Apostles they told him how our Lady Mariyam\nwas dead, and he said unto them, “I did not know it until I saw her body, even as ye made\nme to know when I doubted the Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And when he\ncame to the grave to see the body of our Lady Mariyam, and they opened the grave, they\ncould not find her body; and they were amazed and marveled exceedingly.   And\nstraightway Thomas told them how he had saluted her holy body as the angels were\ncarrying her up [to heaven].  And the Holy Spirit said unto them, “God doth not wish her\nbody to lie in the earth.”  And God made a covenant with the Apostles that even as He\nhad shown Himself, so He would show her to His servants a second time, and He bade\nthem wait until the seventeenth day of the month Nahase (Aug.-Sept.); and He fulfilled\nthe covenant.  And all the days of her life were sixty years; twelve years she lived in the\nTemple, three and thirty years she lived with Joseph, and after the Resurrection of our\nLord Christ she lived for fifteen years in the house of John the evangelist, even as our\nLord commanded her when He said unto her, “Behold thy son,” and to John, “Behold thy\nmother.”  Salutation to the going forth of thy soul from the body without fear of death. \nSalutation to the going forth of thy soul, and to thy death, which was like unto a\nmarriage.\nAnd on this day also died the righteous woman Hilaria, the daughter of the Emperor\nZeno.   Her father was of the True Faith, and he loved the Church.   He begot two\n\ndaughters, namely this saint, and another, but he had no son.  This saint, from her earliest\nyears, used to love to sit by herself, and she determined in her heart to adopt the ascetic\nlife and to wear the garb of the angels.  And she went forth from the palace, and changed\nher apparel, and put on a man’s attire, and departed to the land of Egypt, and thence to the\ndesert of Scete.  And she found there a certain righteous elder whose name was Abba\nBamu, and she told him her mind, and informed him that she was a woman, and he hid\nher secret, and brought her into a cell, and he visited her frequently for twelve years.  And\nshe dwelt in her cell, and as no beard appeared upon her face, the holy elders thought that\nshe was a eunuch, and they called her “Hilarion (sic) the eunuch.”  And an unclean Satan\ntook possession of her sister, whom she had left with her father, and her father gave much\nmoney to the physicians, but they were unable to cure her of her sickness.   And his\nfellow-nobles advised her father to send her to the desert of Scete, to the holy elders, for\nthe report of their holiness had reached the country of Rome.  And her father sent her off\nwith nobles, and officers, and slaves, and handmaidens, and he wrote a letter to the holy\nelders, saying, “O my holy fathers, I will tell you what hath happened to me.  God gave\nme two daughters, and one of them hath fled and I know not whither she hath gone, and\nof this one, her sister, an unclean Satan hath taken possession.  I have always thought that\nshe would be a comforter to me.  I beseech your holinesses to pray on her behalf so that\nGod may heal her of her sickness.”  And when the saints had read the emperor’s letter,\nthey prayed that God would heal her of her sickness; and the holy elders continued to\npray on her behalf for many days, but she was not healed of her sickness.  Then they\ncalled “Hilaria the eunuch.” who was her sister, and said unto her, “Take this daughter of\nthe emperor and pray over her.”  And Saint Hilaria said unto them, “I am a sinner and I\nam not able to do this difficult thing,” but they urged her until she took her.  And Hilaria\ncarried her off to her cell, and prayed for her, and she was healed in a few days and that\nunclean Satan fled.   Now Saint Hilaria knew that the maiden was her sister, but the\nmaiden did not recognize Hilaria, and she embraced her, and kissed her.  And Hilaria\nwent outside [her cell] and wept, and then she brought the maiden to the holy elders, and\nsaid unto them, “Behold, through your prayers I have healed her sickness.”   And the\nsaints rejoiced, and they sent her to her father in peace; and when she arrived and stood\nup by him he rejoiced in her greatly; and all the people in the palace rejoiced, and gave\nthanks to Christ.  And the emperor asked her, saying, “What manner of life didst thou\nlead with the holy elders of the desert of Scete?”  And she told him about Saint Hilarion\n(sic), who healed her of her sickness, and she said unto him, “He loved me very much\nand kissed (?) me.”  when the emperor heard this his mind was greatly disturbed, and he\nsaid unto her, “Is it seemly for a monk to kiss a woman?”  And straightway he sent a\nletter to the holy elders in the desert of Scete, saying, “Send hither to me Saint Hilarion,\nwho healed my daughter, so that I may be blessed by him.”  And the saints called Hilaria\nand commanded her to go to the emperor, and she wept bitterly and prostrated herself at\nthe feet of the desert monks, and said unto them, “I am unable to go there.”  And they\nsaid unto her, “This righteous emperor is a lover of the Church, and it is not seemly for us\nto transgress his commandment, even as the Holy Scriptures command us”; and they\nurged her, and she departed to the emperor her father against her will.  And when she\narrived he saluted her, and all those who were with her.  When the people had gone, and\nthe emperor was left alone with Saint Hilaria, he asked her, saying, “I have been\ndisturbed in my mind because I heard that thou didst kiss my daughter, and I wish thee to\nexplain the matter to me”; now only the emperor and empress were there with Hilaria.\nAnd she said unto them,, “Bring me the Holy Gospel, and swear unto me that if I tell you\nye will not prevent me from departing to the desert of Scete”; and they swore to her even\nas she asked.  Then she spoke unto them, saying, “I am your daughter Hilaria.”  And she\ntold them how her going forth took place, and how she had changed her apparel, and put\non a man’s attire, and she showed them the marks on her body.  And straightway they\ncried out loudly, and all wept [bitterly], and there was a very great outcry in the palace,\nand [her parents] said unto her, “We will never let thee go.”  And Hilaria said unto them,\n“Remember the oath which ye swear to me on the Holy Gospel”; and she passed the\nGreat Fast of forty days with them, and [then] went to the desert of Scete.  And from that\nday the Emperor Zeno, her father, commanded the [governors] to give to the holy men\nwho dwelt in the desert of Scete the tax of the land of Egypt for one year, and after this\n\nthey gave the monks what they needed according to the emperor’s command.  And the\nmonks rejoiced, and they became numerous, and they built nine hundred churches near\nthe monastery of Abba Macarius, and seven hundred churches near the monastery of\nAbba John, and five hundred churches near the monastery of Abba Besoy (‘Ebsoy).  And\nSaint Hilaria lived in the mountain of Scete for five years after she came from her father,\nand she died [in peace], and none knew that she was a woman until she died.  Salutation\nto thy going into the desert of Scete, O Hilaria.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Saint Gregory, the brother of Basil, Bishop of\nDasyat.  Now behold we have mentioned the commemoration of his father and of his\nbrother in the section for the seventh day of the month of Ter.  This blessed man Gregory\nwas appointed Bishop of the city of Dasyat, and he was a most honorable and learned\nman; and behold, we have written a little about his strife in the section for the fifth day of\nthis month Ter.  It is said of him that when he was consecrating the Offering, he used to\nsee the Holy Spirit descending from heaven upon the altar, and then he saw one of the\nCherubim embrace his head, and clasp him to his bosom; and then Gregory would come\nout of this sleep, and rest himself on the altar; and all the people used to think that this\nwas merely the sleep of the body.  When he had completed three and thirty years in his\nEpiscopal office, Saint Basil his brother came to him to visit him, for he was sick of a\ngrievous sickness which was caused by excessive fasting; and Gregory welcomed him\nand rejoiced in him.  And when Saint Gregory welcomed him and rejoiced in him.  And\nwhen Saint Gregory went up to the altar to consecrate the Offering, according to his\nwont, our holy Lady the Virgin Mariyam appeared unto him, and she said unto him, “This\nday thou shalt come with me.”  After he had finished the Liturgy, he asked his brother\nBasil to admonish the people to keep fast hold upon the True Faith.  And he became like\none who was asleep, and when [they tried] to rouse him they found that he was dead. \nAnd Basil commanded them to make a coffin for him, and they did so, and he buried him\nwith many prayers, and psalms and dirges.  Salutation to Gregory.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Nicolaus the martyr, and Abba Victor the bishop.\nAnd on this day also Paul the governor, and Silas the priest became martyrs in the days of\nMarcion, the Emperor of Rome, the Melchite heretic.   When all the faithful were\ngathered together at Gethsemane, on the festival of the death of our Lady, Julian the\ninfidel came and surrounded them, and killed them, leaving not one of them alive.\nOn this day also Bakhayla Maryam became a martyr in Dabra Matmak.\nSalutation to Jeremiah, who prophesied and was rebuked, when Israel loved to worship\ngods of wood and stone.  He destroyed wild beasts and fierce lions by the power of his\nprayer, and therefore his festival is celebrated in Egypt.\nSalutation to Paul the governor, and to Silas the priest.  Salutation to John, whom the\nVirgin Mariyam promised should depart from this world without seeing the terrors of\ndeath.\nSalutation to Kawestos.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and when he was a little older, he bowed before his parents, and obeyed\nthem, and when he was seven years old he learned the Books of the Church.  Now at that\ntime the office of Archbishop of Alexandria was held by Abba Theonas, and when he\nheard the report of Abba Anthony’s childhood, he sent a messenger and had him brought to\nhim, and he blessed him and prophesied concerning him, saying, “This child shall become\ngreat before God, and the report of him shall go up into all countries”; and he laid his hand\nupon him and made him a deacon.  Then his parents died and they left him a little sister. \nSix months after his parents died he went to the church according to his custom, and the\nlove of the Holy Spirit entered his heart, and he said, “Consider how the Apostles forsook\ntheir business and followed our Lord and Redeemer Christ.  They sold their possessions,\neven as it is written in the Acts of the Apostles, and they brought the price thereof and\nplaced it at the feet of the Apostles, so that they might give it to those who were needy, and\nthat the hoped-for things which God had prepared for them in the heavens might be\ndoubled.”  And he was always meditating upon this in his heart.  And then he went to the\nchurch and heard our Lord saying to the rich man in the Holy Gospel, “If thou wishest to\nbe perfect, go and sell all thy possessions, and give [their price] to the poor, and lay up for\nthyself treasure in heaven, and come, follow Me.”  And Anthony derived his holy mind\nfrom the Lord, for he thought that those words had gone forth for him; and forthwith he\nwent out from the church.  Now his father possessed good broad lands, and these he gave\nto the men of the city, and the goods which his parents had left him he gave to the poor\nand needy, and he took his sister and deposited her with the virgins.  And he loved fasting\nand prayer, and the life of self-abnegation, and the spiritual fight.   Now the word\n“monasticism” had not appeared in those days, and if any man desired to devote himself to\nGod he went a little way outside the city, and dwelt by himself, and lived an ascetic life. \nEven thus did the great saint Abba Anthony.  And Satan, who fighteth by means of the\n[sinful] impulse of the flesh, and the committal of sin, used to bring a woman’s person to\nAnthony in a dream, in such a way that she seemed to be sleeping with him; but he\novercame all these things by the help of God, which was with him.  Then he departed to a\ntomb on the seashore, and he dwelt therein and closed the doors of the tomb on himself,\nand fought a great fight [therein].  And his kinsfolk and acquaintances used to visit him\nand bring him food.  When the Satans saw Saint Anthony fighting in this way, they were\njealous of him, and they came to him and beat him with very severe beatings, which\ncaused him great pain, and then they would leave him prostrate.  When his kinsfolk came\nto visit him they would find him lying on the ground like a dead man, and they would lift\nhim up and carry him to the church, and God would heal him of his sickness.  When his\nsoul awoke he would command them to lift him up, and take him to his own place, and\nthey would do so.  And when Abba Anthony had conquered the Satans there came to him\nfrom below a multitude [of fiends] in the form of wild beasts, and lions, and wolves, and\nserpents, and scorpions, and each one of them would rear itself up against him to terrify\n\nhim.  But Abba Anthony would laugh at them, and say unto them, “If there be any among\nyou that hath dominion over me, let him conquer me”; and straightway they would be\nscattered before him like smoke.  And God gave him victory over the Satans, and He gave\nhim rest from the suffering and temptations, which they caused him.   Twice a year he\nmade bread for their (i.e. the monks’) food, and the sun dried it.  He allowed no one to\ncome into his cell to him, but [his visitors] stood outside, and he hearkened to their words;\nand he continued to devote himself to the ascetic life and the spiritual fight for a period of\ntwenty years.  Then God commanded him to comfort the people, and to teach them the\nperfect fear of God and His holiness.  And he departed to the district of the Fayyum, and\nmade monks of many of the brethren who were there, and he confirmed them in the Law\nof God (now there were there many religious houses that were [full of] monks and\nspiritual fighters), and then he returned to his mountain.   At that time the days of\npersecution came, and many men received crowns of martyrdom.   And he wished to\nbecome [a martyr], and he forsook his mountain and departed to the city of Alexandria,\nand confessed the Lord Christ; but no man seized him; and he used to visit the believers\nwho were in prison for the Name of Christ, and comfort them.  When the governor saw\nthat Anthony was not afraid of him, he commanded that no monk should ever be allowed\nto approach the governor’s tribunal.  But Anthony appeared there continually, and spoke to\nhim often so that he might exasperate him, and make him angry, and cause him to beat him\nand torture him, so that he (i.e. Anthony) might become a martyr.  But the governor would\nnot talk to him, and he did no harm to him whatsoever, for God preserved Anthony for the\nbenefit of many.   And when the time of persecution was ended, the blessed Peter,\nArchbishop of the city of Alexandria, the perfection of the martyr, became a martyr, and\nAbba Anthony returned to his mountain, according to the Will of God.  Now the apparel,\nwhich he wore, was made of hairy sackcloth, and he never washed himself with water all\nthe days of his life.  And many sick folk came to him, and he prayed over them and healed\nthem.  And when the many people who came to him heard his doctrine, they would not let\nhim live by himself as he wished, and he feared that he would become arrogant of heart\nbecause of what God performed through him.  And he determined in his heart to go to\nUpper Egypt, and live in a place where none knew him; and he took a little bread from the\nbrethren, and he sat down by the side of a stream of water to wait for a ship on which to\nembark and depart.  And whilst he was thinking thus, a voice came to him from heaven,\nsaying, “Anthony, whither wilt thou go?   What dost thou wish for here?”   And he\nanswered and said, “Many people come here, and they prevent me from living in solitude,\nand therefore I wish to go to Upper Egypt.”  And the voice answered and said unto him,\n“If thou wishest to go to Upper Egypt, [go, and thou wilt find] that thy annoyance will be\ndoubled.  But if thou dost indeed wish to live alone, go a journey of three days into the\nInner Desert.”  And having seen certain Arabs who themselves wanted to travel that road,\nAnthony went to them, and asked them that he might go with them into the desert, and\nthey welcomed him with joy.  And he journeyed with them for three days, until they came\nto a very high mountain, where there was clear, sweet, and very cold water, and palms, and\ndate-palms, and fruit trees in abundance; and Anthony loved the place which God had\nprepared for him, and to which He had called him from the sea-shore.  And he dwelt in\nthat place, and the Arabs used to bring him bread.  And there were in that place many\nnoxious beasts, but through the prayer of Anthony God drove them away, and they\nreturned not again to that desert.  And he used to go to his mountain, which was beyond\nthe seashore from time to time, and visit the brethren who were there, and comfort them,\nand then he would return to his mountain in the desert.  And the report of Anthony was\nheard of by Constantine the righteous emperor, and he wrote to him a letter praising him,\nand asking him to remember him at the time of prayer; and the brethren rejoiced at the\nemperor’s letter.  Now Saint Anthony did not send back a written answer to the emperor’s\nletter, but he said unto the brethren, “Behold, the letter of the King of kings is read to us\n\nevery day, but we neither submit to its commands nor hearken to it.”  And the brethren\nanswered and said unto him, “This righteous emperor is a lover of the Church, and it is\nmeet for thee to comfort him.”  And he wrote a letter to him, and comforted him, and\nblessed him, and his kingdom, and all his soldiers.  And the report of Anthony was also\nheard by a Frankish king, namely the King of the country of Barkinon, which was situated\nat a distance of seven months’ journey from the country of Egypt.  And the Frankish king\nsent unto Saint Abba Anthony, saying, “I beseech and entreat thee, by the Passion of our\nLord Christ, to come to us, and bless us, and all our city, and our army.”  When Anthony\nheard these words he was exceedingly sorry because the king said, “by the Passion of our\nLord Christ.”  And Anthony stood up and prayed, saying, “I beseech Thee, O my Lord\nJesus Christ, to do Thy Will in me.  If Thou wishest me to go to the Frankish country of\nBarkinon, give me a sign of Thy Will.”  Whilst he was saying these words, behold a cloud\nof light appeared, and it carried him and brought him during the night to the Frankish\ncountry.  And the king rejoiced in him with a great joy, and all his soldiers and people\nlikewise rejoiced, and they brought to him those who were sick and the blind and the lame,\nand he healed them by his prayer forthwith.  And he dwelt with them for seven months,\nteaching them the way of righteousness and life, and he arrayed many thousands in the\ngarb of the monastic life.  And each Sunday the cloud of light bore him away and brought\nhim to his monastery, and he went among his sons and comforted them, for on the\nfollowing day that cloud would bear him away, and take him back to the Frankish land. \nAfter this, by the Will of God, he returned to his monastery, riding upon the cloud.  One\nday laziness (or inertness) came upon him and there came unto him a voice which said,\n“Get thee outside the city so that thou mayest see.”  And he went outside [the city] and he\nfound there the similitude of an angel who wore the garb of the monastic life, and the\ngirdle, and the cord of the cross, and on his head was a skullcap like a helmet; and he was\nsitting down plaiting palm leaves.  Then he rose up and prayed and sat down again, and\ncontinued to plait palm leaves.  And a voice came unto Anthony, saying, “O Anthony, act\nin this wise, and thou shalt have rest from war against Satans.”  And Anthony took the\nangel who was dressed as a monk as an example, and from that day neither inertness, nor\nthe war of the Satans attacked him.  And our Lord Christ appeared unto him many times,\nand comforted him and strengthened him, and said unto him, “Verily, I say unto thee, O\nMy chosen one Anthony, because of thy labor, and thy fighting, and thy devotion to God\nalone by thyself in this desert, and because of thy love for Me, I will magnify thy name,\nand will exalt thy horn in all the ends of the earth.  And I will make the desert places and\nthe monasteries like the habitations of doves, and they shall be full of monks, especially\nthine own monasteries, which shall endure until the end of the world.  Whosoever shall\ncelebrate thy commemoration, and shall give alms or incense, or an offering in thy name, I\nwill blot out all his sins and he shall never see punishment.  And I will exalt exceedingly\nthe monastery wherein thy body shall be buried, and I will place therein-righteous monks\nlike angels. and they shall never lack a head until the end of the world.  And I will make\nthe kings, and judges, and rulers of the earth to bring gifts, and to give them to thy\nmonastery, and to thy children the monks who shall keep thy commandments.”  And when\nour Lord had said this He went up into heaven with great glory.   And Abba Anthony\nrejoiced with great joy.   And he prophesied concerning the spoliation of the Church,\nsaying, “Those who doubt the Faith (i.e. heretics) shall have dominion over it, and then it\nshall return to its former state.”   And he prophesied concerning the monks, how they\nwould be many, and would become exceedingly numerous, and how they would abandon\nthe houses and monasteries in the desert, and would dwell in the towns and villages among\nthose who were in the world.  It was Anthony who arrayed Abba Macarius in the garb of\nthe monk, for he was his disciple and son, and he comforted him and confirmed him, and\nmade him to know what would happen unto him.  And he went to Abba Bula (Paule) the\nGreat, the first of the dwellers in the desert, and it was he who buried him in the garment\n\nof Athanasius the Apostle.  When Saint Abba Anthony knew that the time of his death had\ndrawn nigh, he commanded his sons to hide his body, and to give his staff to Abba\nMacarius his son, and his head cloth to Abba Athanasius, and his sheep-skin cloak to Abba\nSerapion the Bishop, his son.  And he lay down on the ground and delivered up his soul\ninto the hand of God.  And all the companies of the holy angels came to it, and they met it\nwith great joy, and they took it up to everlasting rest in the heavens.   And Anthony’s\nchildren hid his body as he commanded, for he used to rebuke those who showed the\nbodies of the holy martyrs with the object of getting much money and possessions thereby,\nand of keeping these possessions for themselves.  This holy and blessed Anthony lived to a\ngood old age and became very old indeed, but his body, and strength, and power remained\nunchanged, and nothing fell from his shoes(?).  And he never washed in water all the days\nof his life.  And he departed to Christ, Whom he loved, and all the days of his life were one\nhundred and twenty years.  Salutation to Anthony the solitary.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and the barbarians came and slaughtered\nall the nine and forth elder monks.  And the son of the messenger of the emperor turned\nback from the road, and he saw the angels laying crowns upon the heads of the elder\nmartyrs; now the name of that young man was Deyas.   And he said unto his father,\n“Behold, I see the angels of the spiritual beings laying crowns on the heads of the elders. \nAnd now, I myself will go and receive a crown like them.”  And his father answered and\nsaid unto him, “I will go with thee, O my son,” and they went back and revealed\nthemselves to the pagan barbarians, who slew them, and they received crowns of\nmartyrdom.  After the barbarians had departed the monks came down from the fortress,\nand they collected the bodies of the saints, and they made them ready for burial and laid\nthem in a cave.  And they prayed before them each night, and sang psalms and hymns, and\nwere blessed by them.  And certain men came and stole the body of Saint Abba John, and\ntook it to the city of Bitanun; and the saints waited a few days, and then took him and\nbrought him into his place, and the others [they took] to the Fayyum.  And they stole the\nbody of the young man, [the son of the emperor’s messenger,] and when they brought it to\nthe Fayyum, the angel of God snatched it up, and brought it back to the body of his father. \nMany times did the monks try [by night] to separate the body of the young man from that\nof his father, but in the morning they found the two bodies together again.  At length one\nof the elders saw the messenger in a vision, who said unto him, “Glory be to God!  When\nwe were in the flesh we were never separated, and why should we be separated when we\n\nare with our Lord Christ?”  From that day none separated them.  When the barbarians\npillaged the desert of Scete the monks were afraid for the bodies of the holy elders, and\nthey removed them from their places to the pit of the church of Saint Macarius.  And they\nmade for them a large shrine there [in the form of] a cave, and they built over it a church in\ntheir names in the days of Theodosius the archbishop.  And when Abba Benjamin came to\nthe desert of Scete he established for them a festival on the fifth day of the month of\nYakatit, the day when his body and theirs appeared.  And the church, which existeth to this\nday, is well known, and its name in Coptic is “Behama Bakasit,” that is to say, “nine and\nforty martyrs.”  Salutation to the nine and forty martyrs.\nAnd on this day also died Saint Anastasia.  This holy woman was a daughter of the palace\nof the city of Constantinople, and she was exceedingly beautiful.  The Emperor Bastianus\nwished to marry her, but she did not wish this, and she never imagined it in her heart, for\nthe emperor already had a wife living; on the contrary she made known to the wife of the\nemperor that the emperor wanted to marry her.  And the wife of the emperor sent this holy\nwoman out of the palace secretly, and she caused her to be taken by ship to the country of\nEgypt, and she built her a religious house outside the city of Alexandria, and that house\nwas called by her name.  And when the emperor knew that Saint Anastasia had departed to\nthe land of Egypt, he sent after her and searched for her.  And when Anastasia knew this,\nshe put on a man’s dress, and disguised herself as a judge (or officer), and fled to the\ndesert of Scete, and took refuge with Abba Daniel, the abbot, to whom she revealed her\nsecret.  And he took her and placed her in a cell by herself and no one knew that she was a\nwoman, but Saint Daniel commanded a righteous elder to draw a vessel of water for her\nonce a week, and to set it down by the door of that cell.  And she lived there for eight and\ntwenty years, fighting the fight, and leading the ascetic life with fasting, and prayer, and\nprostrations, and vigil.  And when the elder died who used to draw water for her, Abba\nDaniel commanded his disciple to do as the elder used to do.  And the holy woman used to\nwrite her will on a tile and set it down by the door of her cell, and the disciple of Abba\nDaniel would take the tile to his teacher knowing nothing whatsoever about what was\nwritten upon it.  One day he brought the tile to his teacher, and when Abba Daniel had read\nit, he wept, and said unto his disciple, “Rise up, O my son, let us go and bury the body of\nthis saint, for he wished to be free from his body.”  And they went and came to the cell,\nand they received a blessing from Anastasia, and she said unto Abba Daniel, “For God’s\nsake do not wrap me up for burial in anything except this garment which is on me”; then\nshe prayed and said, “I commit myself to the keeping of God,” and she lay down on the\nground and died.  And they wept over her, and took thought for burying her.  When the\ndisciple of Abba Daniel drew near to her to swathe her, he saw that her breasts were like\nunto dried fig leaves; (now they became like this through excessive ascetic practices,) and\nAbba Daniel marveled, and was silent.  When they had buried her they returned to their\ncell, and his disciple fell down at the feet of Abba Daniel, and he entreated him, saying,\n“For God’s sake, tell me the story of this saint, for I saw that she was a woman.”  And\nAbba Daniel began to tell him how she belonged to a noble and royal family of the city of\nConstantinople.  And how she gave herself to Christ, and how she abandoned the glory of\nthis fleeting world, and how this woman fought the great fight which she fought against\nSatan, and how she cast aside a woman’s weakness, and overcame the might of strong\nmen, and pleased God, should serve as admonitions to us who are men.\nSalutation to the nine and forty monks who became martyrs, and the emperor’s messenger\nand his son, and to Anastasia.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Mesratius (Masterius), and Sernius (Sorenus), the\nmartyrs, and Joseph, who loved the poor.  Salutation to Joseph, who was like unto Tabitha,\nand gave away all his possessions.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and the governor shut Sarabyos (Serapion) up in prison.  When the men of\nthe city heard of this, they gathered together with the soldiers, and they came to the\ngovernor, bringing their weapons of war with them, and they wanted to kill the governor\nand to take the saint from him.  And the saint prevented them, and said unto them, “I came\nof my own free will to shed my blood for the Name of Christ, our Lord.”   And the\ngovernor embarked on a ship and departed, and the saint went with him, and when they\narrived at the city of Alexandria the governor commanded the soldiers to torture the saint\nseverely on the wheel, [and they did so].  And they cast him into a red-hot furnace, and\nboiled him in a cauldron of pitch and bitumen, and they cut the tendons of his body, and\nthey laid him on a [red-hot] iron bed, and they drove iron nails through his body.  And the\nsaint bore all these tortures patiently, for the angel of God sustaineth him that is tortured. \nThen they hung him upon a tree, and shot at him with arrows, but the angel of God\nbrought him down, and he bound the governor with fetters, and hung him up in the place\nof the saint and shot at him with arrows, whilst the governor cried out, “I am Romanus the\ngovernor.”  And Saint Sarabyos (Serapion) said unto him,  “As God liveth I will not bring\nthee down from this tree until thou hast set free all those who are in prison; and thou shalt\nwrite an account of their strifes, and thou shalt command the soldiers to cut off their\nheads.”   [And the governor did so,] and they received crowns of martyrdom in the\nkingdom of the heavens; now they were in number five hundred and thirty souls.  And\nRomanus commanded a certain nobleman, whose name was Harneus to take the saint with\nhim to his city, and to torture him there and, if he would not turn from his unclean opinion,\nto kill him; and the nobleman took the saint with him in the ship.  When night came they\narrived in port, and they slept, (now, by the Will of God the ship came to the native city of\nthe saint,) and when the sailors woke up in the morning and found that the place where\nthey arrived had been changed, they marveled exceedingly.  And a voice came to Sarabyos\n(Serapion), saying, “Behold, this is thy city.”  And they brought him out of the ship, and\ntortured him severely, and they cut off his head with the sword, and he received the crown\nof martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  And Romanus brought down his apparel,\nand swathed him for burial, and gave him to his kinsfolk.   Salutation to Sarabyos\n(Serapion) the martyr.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated the translation of the body of Saint Timothy, the\nApostle, from the city of Ephesus to the city of Constantinople; it was translated by the\nrighteous Emperor Constantine who translated many of the bodies of the holy apostles and\nmartyrs to the city of Constantinople.  When he heard that the body of Saint Timothy was\nin the city of Ephesus, he sent certain faithful priests, and they translated it to the city of\nConstantinople, and they laid it in the Sanctuary of the Holy Apostles.  Salutation to the\ntranslation of thy body, O Timothy.\nAnd on this day also is celebrated the festival of Suriel, who is called “Safori,” who was\nwith the righteous man Ezra, and told him hidden mysteries.  He prayeth always on behalf\n\nof sinners.  Salutation to Suriel.\nAnd on this day also Saint Abba Bifamon became a martyr.  This saint was a virgin from\nhis youth, and he loved God, and he was merciful to the poor and the needy; and he\nabandoned this fleeting world.   His father, whose name was Anastasius, belonged to a\nnoble family, and his mother’s name was Sosna (Susannah); and they were Christians, and\nthey loved almsgiving, and they kept the festivals of our Lord Christ, and of our Lady\nMary, and of the holy martyrs; and they gave to the poor whatsoever they needed.  And\nthey lived in the city of Wesim in the district of Mesr (Cairo).  And God gave them this\nsaint, whose form was exceeding goodly, and they rejoiced and added to their good works\nand benevolence.  When he was grown up, and his days were nine years, they handed him\nover to a certain God-fearing priest that he might teach him; and the priest took him and\ntaught him literature, and philosophy; and he admonished him, and made him strong in the\nknowledge of the Books of the Holy Church.   And he attended church devotedly, and\nfasted, and prayed, and kept vigil, and made prostrations; and God wrought many signs\nand wonders by his hands, of which the following are examples:  There was a certain poor\nman who was sick of a disease in his hands and feet, and he begged the saint to give him\nalms, and the saint stretched out his holy hands to give the beggar money, and straightway\nhe was healed of his disease, and he became whole and without a blemish, and all his\nlimbs became sound.  And on another occasion when he was reciting the Psalms of David,\na certain man there, whom an unclean spirit had thrown down, cried out, saying, “O saint\nof God, let me destroy him, for his parents oppress men”; and the saint prayed, and made\nentreaty to God, and the man whom the Satan cast down was healed.  And the angel of\nGod appeared unto the teacher of the saint, (now he was a righteous man,) and he\ninformed him about all that would happen to the young man Bifamon, and said unto him,\n“He shall become a martyr”; and the priest and his mother Sosna (Susannah) paid him\ngreater honor than before.  And as he grew up he continued to do the works of excellence,\nand works of the spirit, without ceasing, and at length the report of him was heard in all\ncountries.  And our Lord Jesus Christ used to appear unto him with His holy angels, and\nour Lady Mary used to comfort him.  And he lived with his teacher for eight years.  And\nhe used to remain without eating for seven days and seven nights at a time, and he ate once\na week only.  And his parents spoke to him about marrying a wife, and he said unto them,\n“What is the good of a wife to me in this fleeting world, for it shall pass away and all the\ndesire thereof?”  And his parent rejoiced in him, and they added to their good works from\nthat day onwards.  Six months after this his parents died, and the saint gave alms to the\npoor, and he devoted himself to the Church, and strove to fulfill all the commandments of\nthe Holy Gospel.  And in those days certain men of the Persians rose up against Rome and\nthey slew Numerianus, the king, in battle, and the empire of Rome remained without an\nemperor; now Numerianus left only two daughters and one son, whose name was Justus,\nand who became a martyr.  And the chiefs of the palace gathered together, and they took\ncounsel together, and they sent messengers into every country to collect for them strong\nmen for the war.  And when the messengers came to Upper Egypt, they found a strong and\npowerful young man, with a bold heart, pasturing sheep, and his name was “’Agripada”;\nand he had been a habitation for Satan from his youth up.  And the messengers rejoiced\nexceedingly, and they took him with them to the city of Antioch, and when ‘Agripada\narrived the officer, who was captain of the royal horses, rejoiced in him.   One day\n‘Agripada took a couple of reeds tied together and played upon them like a flute, and\nSatan entered into the horses, and they capered about and cried out with loud cries.  And\nthe daughter of the king who had arrived at woman’s estate, heard the noise, and she\nlooked out of her window in the upper room of the palace, and ‘Agripada pleased her with\nhis playing.  And Satan thrust into her heart the desire for fornication, and she summoned\nhim to her, and she married him, and arrayed him in [royal] apparel, and called him\n“Diocletian,” for they used to change the names of men when they became kings.  And\nwhen the younger daughter of the king saw what the elder had done, she became jealous,\nand she married an officer whose name was Maximianus, and she arrayed him in royal\napparel, and made him a king; and Maximianus and Diocletian were equals in the\nkingdom of the city of Antioch.  And Satan appeared unto them and said, “I am he who set\nthe idea of fornication in the hearts of the king’s daughters, who have made you kings.  If\n\nye will obey my commandment, I will make all men on the earth to submit to you. \nHenceforward bow down, and worship me.  Make models [of men and women] in gold\nand silver, and call them gods, Apollo, Artemis, and the like, and command all men to\nperform the ceremony of incense before them.  Shut the churches, and open the houses of\nidols, and command ye all the men who are in the palace to do this.  Whosoever will not\nobey you and worship the gods shall die an evil death; cut off his head with a sharp\nsword.”  And they answered and said unto Satan, “We will obey thee, and will do as thou\ntellest us.”  And they worshipped him straightway, and they did all that Satan commanded\nthem to do in every country of their kingdom.  And they appointed a certain nobleman,\nwhose name was Romans, governor over the city of Alexandria, and all the region round\nabout, and they made Arianus governor over the city of Antinoe and Egypt, and they\ncommanded them to carry out these orders in all the towns and villages.   When Abba\nBifamon heard this report, he was exceedingly sorry, and he hid himself until he knew\nwhat was going to happen.  And he called his friend Theodore, and they talked together for\na day about what they had heard, and they were exceedingly sad.  And they multiplied\ntheir prayers, and entreated God to save them from evil.  And Saint Bifamon increased his\ngood works, and report of him was made to the infidel king, and to Maximianus, by the\ndeniers of Christ.  And they told them, saying, “A certain man whose name is Bifamon, of\nthe city of Wesim, on the border of Mesr (Cairo), is a Christian magician, and he\ntrangresseth the commands of the kings, and he curseth the gods.”  And straightway the\nking wrote a letter and sent it to Arianus, and commanded him to take the saint and to\ntorture him until he worshipped Apollo and Artemis, and if he would not obey, to cut off\nhis head with the sword.  And the angel of God appeared unto Saint Bifamon and told him\nwhat had taken place, and he informed him that he and his mother would become martyrs. \nAnd he showed him the crowns, which were prepared for himself and his mother, and he\ncommanded him to depart, and to take with him his slave Diganes.  And straightway Saint\nAbba Bifamon rose up and came to his mother, and told her all that he had seen, and she\ntold him how she had seen the same vision; and the saints Abba Bifamon and his mother\nrejoiced together.  And the saint went to his abode and prayed until the morning.  When the\nmorning had come he sent again to his friend Theodore, who came to him, and Bifamon\ntold him what he had seen.  And he said unto him, “After the days of the persecution have\npassed by thou shalt be appointed bishop of this city”; and he commanded to build a\nchurch for him, and then they embraced and bade each other farewell.  After a few days\nArianus the governor came to the city of Wesim, and he had the head men of the city\nbrought to him, and he questioned them concerning Bifamon, the judge, and said unto him,\n“This man curseth the gods”; and the head men of the city were sorry on account of Saint\nAbba Bifamon, for he was beloved by them.  At that time Abba Bifamon rose up, and put\non beautiful apparel, and prayed for a long time, and then he embraced all the men of his\nhouse, and mounted his white horse, and he went to the place where all the head men of\nthe city were gathered together; and when they saw him they paid him honor and went\nwith him to Arianus the governor.  And when Arianus saw Abba Bifamon, he rejoiced in\nhim, and he rose up and embraced him and said unto him, “Peace be unto thee.”  And the\nsaint answered, “Why dost thou say ‘peace’ to me? for the interpretation of ‘peace’ is\n‘joy.’   Verily I rejoice, and am glad, because I am going to the Lord my God and\nRedeemer, Jesus Christ.”  As for thee, however, the Book saith of [such as] thee, “There is\nno joy for the wicked” (Isaiah xlviii, 22).  And Arianus said unto him, “I did not come for\nthee to speak words of insult to me, but I came to thee with an order from the emperor\ncommanding thee to offer sacrifice to the gods.”   And the saint said unto him, “God\nforbid!  But it is right that I should worship the True God, and not the work of the hand of\nman, as the prophet saith: ‘The gods of the nations are of gold and silver, the work of the\nhands of the children of men.  Mouths they have and they speak not, hands have they and\nthey handle not, feet have they and they walk not, eyes have they and they see not, ears\nhave they and they hear not, noses have they and they smell not; they speak not with their\nthroats, and there is no breath in their mouths’ (Psalm cxv, 4 ff.).  May all those who make\nthem become like unto them.  I will worship none save my Lord Jesus Christ.”  When\nArianus heard these words from him he was exceedingly angry with him, and he tortured\nhim with every kind of torture; and he tied him to the back (tail ?) of a horse, which he\nmade to gallop through all the city.  And when his mother and his servants heard of this\n\nthey all came [to him], (now his servants were five hundred [in number,]) and the saint\nrebuked them and spoke unto them, and his mother with them, many words from the Holy\nGospel.  But they all cried out, saying, boldly, “We are Christians,”  and they overturned\nthe throne of Arianus the infidel.  And the governor commanded the soldiers to dig a large\npit, and to fill it with fire, and to cast them all into it alive; and they did as he commanded\nthem; and Saint Abba Bifamon encouraged them, and exhorted them, and made them to\nendure [their sufferings] until they finished their martyrdom.  And the mother of the saint\nasked him to pray for her, and he made the sign of the Cross over her, and said unto her,\n“Depart in peace”; and straightway they cast her body into the fire, and she received the\ncrown of martyrdom with those martyrs.  And Arianus sent the saint to Maximianus the\nemperor, and straightway the emperor said unto him, “Art thou Bifamon the sorcerer? \nThou hast transgressed our command, and hast not worshipped the gods.”  And the saint\nsaid unto him, “I will not worship thy gods.  Only Jesus Christ our Lord will I worship; as\nfor thee, thou canst go to Ghannum.”   And the emperor was wroth, and tortured him\nseverely, and when he was tired of torturing him he sent him to Romanus, who sent him to\nArianus.  Now the saint neither ate nor drank the whole time he was on the journey.  And\nArianua took the saint, and drove sharp nails through his hands and his feet, and he said\nunto him, “If thou wilt not worship the gods I will destroy thee”; and the saint reviled him\nand his gods, and cursed them.  And Arianus commanded the soldiers to drag him through\nthe city, and to burn him outside the city of Antinoe, and they did so, but our Lord Jesus\nChrist took him out of the fire uninjured.  Now when the saint was standing in the fire\nmuch blood flowed from his feet.   And there was standing there among the people a\ncertain blind leper, and he took some of the blood and smeared it on his eyes and on his\nbody, and straightway he became able to see, and his body was cleansed from his leprosy. \nAnd he cried out, and confessed our Lord Jesus Christ, and said boldly, “I am a Christian, I\nbelieve on my Lord Jesus Christ.”  And Arianus commanded them to cut off his head with\nthe sword, and they did so, and he received the crown of martyrdom.  And Saint Bifamon\ncalled his servant Diyoganos (Diogenes) and commanded him secretly to anoint his body\nand to swathe it with fine linen, and to relate the story of his fight to the believers who\nwere in the city of Wesim, and to tell them that the days of persecution would pass; and he\nmade over his body the sign of the Cross, saying, “In the Name of the Father, and the Son,\nand the Holy Ghost, One God.”  And the saint approached the soldiers and said unto them,\n“Do ye what the governor hath commanded you [to do].”  And the soldiers took him away\nfrom the governor to a place where they would be with him alone, and they cut off his\nhead, and he received the incorruptible crown of martyrdom.  And much blood flowed\nfrom his neck, and his servant Diyoganos (Diogenes ?) spread out the fine linen napkin\nwhich he had laid up by him, and caught the holy blood therein, and so sweet a perfume\nfilled that place that the soldiers marveled, and were dismayed, and great fear fell upon\nthem.   And when the soldiers departed many believers came, and they and his servant\nprepared the body of the saint for burial in a splendid manner, and they brought sweet-\nsmelling unguents ad anointed it, and sang many psalms and dirges over it.   And\nstraightway they carried it outside the city to the west, and they buried it there, and many\nmiracles were made manifest at his grave.  And the servant of the saint took that napkin\nand laid it upon him.  And when he wished to depart to his city he fell into doubt and\nwondered what he should do.  And Saint Bifamon appeared unto him, and told him to\nmake known his story to his friend Theodore, and to the men of his city.  And God sent\nunto him certain believers who carried him with them in the ship, and whilst he was with\nthem in the ship God made manifest many miracles through that napkin.  And his servant\nDiyoganos (Diogenes ?) told them all that had happened to Saint Bifamon, and they\nmarveled exceedingly and glorified God.  Then he came to his city Wesim, and he told his\nfriend Theodore everything, which had happened to Saint Bifamon, and he gave him the\nnapkin through which very many signs and wonders took place.  And this napkin was kept\nby them until the infidel Diocletian died, and Constantine the righteous reigned.  And the\ndays of persecution came to an end, when the Christian people enjoyed rest and peace in\n[all] the cities.  And God wished to reveal the body of Saint Bifamon, so that it might be a\nhope to the believers, and a consolation, and strength.  Now he became a martyr in the city\nof Kaw, in Upper Egypt, in the district of Tema, on the twenty-seventh day of the month of\nTer.  And God made manifest from his body signs and wonders, and great healings, and\n\nespecially in the church in the city of Demonu, on the twenty-seventh day of the month of\nTer.  On that day many people assemble therein, and God maketh manifest in them great\nhealing through the martyrdom of Bifamon.  Salutation to Abba Bifamon.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Theophilantus and Sarnis (or Sosa), the martyrs.\nAnd on this day they [angels] carried away Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel,\nthe son of Cainan, the son of Henok (Enos), the son of Seth, the son o Adam, with the\nrushing of stars, and of lightening and of winds, and they took him up above the heavens\nand seated him between two spiritual beings.  And he is called the scribe of the\ncommandments of God.  And he said, “I will answer on behalf of the righteous, and of him\nthat goeth forth, holy and great, from the habitation of God.”  And thence he treadeth upon\nMount Sina, and appeareth with the armies and mighty powers from heaven, and everyone\nfeareth him when he is on the waters.  He judgeth Dan, which is on the right hand of the\nArabs, and he reciteth the memorials of their petitions until the sleep of a dream calleth\nhim, and visions of all are upon him; and they revile the watchers of heaven.  And he drew\nnigh a house which was built upon a stone of crystal, and the walls whereof were inlaid\nwith slabs of stone.  And he saw another house which was larger than this, and all its doors\nwere open, and it was built on a tongue of fire, which uttered praise and glory.  And he\nlooked and saw a high throne, and the appearance thereof was that of ice, and the circle\nthereof was like the sun; and the voice of a cherub was going forth under the throne.  And\nhe saw seven mountains, three facing the east and three facing the south, and the middle\none projected upwards into the heavens.  And he saw one hundred and forty wings, and the\nlord of the winds, and he saw four other faces.  And he prophesied concerning Christ,\nsaying, “With the Head of Days was going another, and His face was like the face of a\nman, and it was fitted with grace like one of the holy angels.”  And he also saith\nconcerning Christ, “And in that day the Son of man shall be called before the Head of\nDays, when as yet the sun shall not have been created, nor the stars made.”  And he also\nsaith, “He shall be a staff to the righteous, and a lights of heaven and described them, one\nby one, each to its people, each to its dominion, and each by its name.  And he spoke\nconcerning the doors of heavens; one in the west, one on the right hand, and one on the\nleft.”  And he spoke concerning Adam, “Behold, a bull went forth from the earth, and this\n[bull] was white.”  And he spoke concerning Eve, saying, “There went forth a calf, a\nfemale.”  And he saith concerning the Temple:  “I saw them overturning this ancient\nhouse, and they brought out all the pillars, and all the plants (?) and beauty of this house.” \nAnd concerning the Church he saith:  “God brought sheep into a new house, which was\nlarger and higher than the one before it, and He set them in the front one, which was\nveiled, and all the pillars thereof were new, and the beauty thereof was new, and greater\nthan that of the former house which was rejected, and all the sheep were in the midst\nthereof.”  And he speaketh concerning the believers:  “These sheep were all white, and\ntheir wool was abundant and pure, and all those who were scattered and the wild beasts of\nthe desert, and the fowl of the heavens, were gathered together into this house, for they\nwere all chosen, and they returned to his house.”  Salutation to Enoch, who was caught up\ninto heaven.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

but God raised him up whole\nand uninjured, even as he was at first.  Third martyrdom:  And when the governor was\ntired of torturing him, he sent him to Maximianus in the city of Nicomedia, and he tortured\nhim severely, but God put him and all his enemies to shame, and raised him up whole and\nuninjured.  Fourth martyrdom:  When Maximianus was tired to torturing him he sent him\nback to the governor of Kiras, the city in which he had been reared, and the governor\ntortured him very severely.   Fifth martyrdom:   The governor of Kiras sent him to the\nEmperor Tatianus, and the saint found many confessors there, and he comforted them, for\nthe saint was perfect in his speech, and the grace of God was upon him; and the emperor\ntortured him severely.  Sixth martyrdom, by the hand of Maximianus:  And when they took\nhim there, the saint found Ganikalawos, and many martyrs, and Maximianus tortured him\nseverely.   Seventh martyrdom by the hand of Lucian the governor, who tortured him\nseverely, and then cut off his head; thus the saint received the crown of martyrdom.  And a\ncertain believing woman whose name was Sophia came and took his body, and prepared it\nfor burial and buried it.  Salutation to Clement.\nAnd on this day also Saint Abba ‘Akaweh became a martyr.  This holy man came from the\ncountry of the Fayyum, from a city the name of which is Bamay, and he fought a great\nfight in the ascetic life.  And Satan appeared unto him boldly, and the saint seized him by\nthe hair of his head, and punished him very severely; and Satan adjured the saint, saying,\n“By the Passion of Christ, release me.”  And the saint sent him away and he disappeared in\nthe form of smoke.  Then the saint went to the governor’s house during the time of the\npersecution, and he cried out boldly, saying, “I am a Christian,” and the governor tortured\nhim severely, and after this he cut off his head with a sword; and the saint received the\ncrown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  And his body is at the present day in\nthe monastery of Naklon, and many signs and miracles appear through it.  Salutation to\nAbba ‘Akaweh.\n\nAnd on this day eight hundred (sic) men of the company of Saint ‘Akaweh became\nmartyrs.  Salutation to you, O ye eight hundred martyrs.\nSalutation to you, O ye company of men who pleased God, from among whom sprang\nClement.\nSalutation to Abraham, the servant of God, and Isaac, His friend, and Israel, His beloved.\nAnd on this day also died Saint Joseph, son of the Jew Mahawe,   This saint was an\nIsraelite, and he grew up in the Jewish Faith, and learned the Books of the Jews.  One day\nhe saw the Christian children learning from a book, and he asked his mother to let him join\nthem, and she permitted him to do so, and he learned all the Christian Books, and the Faith\nof Christ entered his heart.  One day he met a young man who was a Christian, who loved\nhim greatly and taught him the Christian Law at the time of the Eucharist, and Joseph\nreceived the Holy Mysteries.  And on the following day [the children of] the readers, and\nthe psalm-singers gathered together to Joseph, and they made with their apparel the\nsimilitude of a tabernacle and a shrine, and they brought bread from their parents’ houses,\nand they appointed an archbishop and bishops from among their number.   Then they\namused themselves, and celebrated the sacrament of the Offering, and then they went and\nate and drank in the house of the priest, and he taught them and they remained thus.  When\nthe father of Joseph heard of this he was filled with wrath, and he bound the arms of his\nson behind him, and he took him into the tavern, and cast him into the red-hot oven which\nwas there, and shut the door upon him; but the angel of God extinguished the fire and\ncooled [the oven].  And the mother of Joseph missed her son, and she wept and lamented\nand she did not know what to do.  And after seven days and seven nights had passed, a\ncertain John heard the story of Joseph, and how he was in the oven, and he went with his\ncompanions, and they wept for him, and cried out to him by his name.  And Joseph said\nunto them, “Weep ye not, O my brethren, I am alive by the help of our Lady Mary, the\nmother of our Lord Jesus Christ, for it was she who hid me in her apparel in the red-hot\noven.”  When they heard this, they told the archbishop, and he went with the priests, and a\nBook of the Gospel, and a Cross, and censers, and he came into the oven, and made a\nprayer, and brought out Joseph unscathed from the midst of the fire, and untied his bonds. \nAnd Joseph asked him for Christian baptism.  And when his father Mahawe heard of this,\nhe fell down at the feet of the archbishop, and he believed on Christ, together with the men\nof his house.  And Joseph continued to fast seven days at a time until he was eight and\ntwenty years old, when he entered his cell.  When he knew that his departure was nigh, he\ncame into the church of Saint George the martyr, and he stood before the picture of our\nholy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and entreated her to make intercession for him with her Son.\nAnd she spoke to him from out of the picture, saying, “Rejoice, O Joseph, on the third day,\nat the third hour of the day, thou shalt die.”  Salutation to Joseph.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Tabela and her three sons.\nAnd on this day also God blessed seven (sic) loaves, and a few fish, even as it is said in the\nGospel [Matthew xiv, 19].\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

(Xenae), which is, being interpreted, “stranger.”  This holy\nwoman was the daughter of rich and noble parents of the city of Rome, and she was their\nonly child.  And she fought the spiritual fight from her youth up, and she fasted and prayed\nfrequently by day and by night, and she went to a certain house of virgins in the city of\nRome, and devoted herself to them.  What food the servants used to bring her from her\nfather’s house she gave to the poor and needy, and she ate the food, which the virgins ate. \nAnd she was always reading the histories of nuns, and she made many petitions to God\nthat He would made her a companion to them.  And her father betrothed her to a certain\nnobleman of the city of Rome, and they arrayed her in glorious apparel, and adorned her\nwith jewels of gold and silver.  And when the day of the marriage-feast and the marriage\narrived, he said unto her mother, “O my mother, when ye have given me in marriage, for\nsome time I shall not be able to go to the nunnery.  I wish to go to visit them now, and to\nembrace and salute them, and I will return quickly.”  And her mother said unto her, “Go,\nmy daughter, and tarry not.”  When her mother said this to her, ‘Aksani (Xenae) took all\nher ornaments of gold and silver, and her royal apparel, and with her two handmaidens she\ndeparted and went to the sea, where she found a ship which was sailing for the island of\nCyprus, and she with her handmaidens embarked in the ship and arrived in the island of\nCyprus.  And she called herself ‘Aksani (Xenae), which is being interpreted, “stranger.” \nAnd she went to Saint Epiphanius, and told him all her business, and he sent her to the city\nof Alexandria.  And when she arrived there the Apostle Paul appeared unto her in a dream\nand told her everything, which she was to do, and called her by her name.  And on the\nfollowing day she visited Saint Theophilus, the archbishop, and she shaved off the hair of\nher head, and he arrayed her in the garb of the men.  And she sold all she had with her,\nboth her silver ornaments and her apparel, and she built a church in the name of Saint\nStephen the Protomartyr.  And she and certain of the principal virgins and nuns all lived in\nthat church, and this holy woman fought a great spiritual fight.  She ate nothing else except\nherbs.  She slept upon the bare ground and had no mattress, and she lived in this way, and\ncarried on her good fight, and the working of righteousness for a period of more than eight\nyears.  Then she fell sick a little and died, and on the day of her death God, the Most High,\nrevealed that she was blessed by the grace of heaven in the following manner:  At the time\nof her death, at noon, the people saw a cross of light, and the brilliancy thereof exceeded\nthat of the sun, and brilliant stars surrounded the cross like a crown, and it continued to\nshine in this wise until they had laid the body of the saint with the bodies of the virgins,\nand then it disappeared.  And the people who were there knew that the cross and the stars\nhad appeared because of the holy woman.  And straightway the two handmaidens told the\narchbishop and all the people about the strife of this saint, from the beginning until the day\nof her death, and how she changed her name and called herself ‘Aksani (Xenae), and how\nshe conjured them to conceal her and her secret, and how she always behaved towards\nthem as their sister and not as their mistress.   And the archbishop and all the people\nmarveled at this, and they wrote an account of her strife from the beginning unto the end\nthereof.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated Cyriacus, the martyr and fighter.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated the pure women of Rome, and Philemunma, and\nJuliana, and Sarabamon, and Abba Gabra Nazrawi of Kawat, and the righteous men of\nDabra Dagi (Degua Me’Elaa).\n\nAnd on this day also is commemorated the festival of the Birth of our Lord Jesus Christ by\nour Lady Mary, the holy Virgin.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated Abba Stephen Falasi (the “stranger”) of the desert\nof the Fayyum.  This holy man was a fighter, and he sought after the manner of the saints\nwho were in the desert.  One day whilst he was wandering about in the desert, he found a\nskull, which had been cast out, and this lay by itself, and it had no flesh on it.  When Saint\nStephen saw it he asked God to make it to inform him concerning the history of the man to\nwhom it belonged, and what kind of faith he had.  And straightway there came forth a\nvoice from the skull, saying, “I was a merchant, but did not travel to make money, I knew\nnothing about alms, and I was satisfied with the multitude of possessions which I had. \nOne day as I was traveling on a journey to a far country I came to a desert place wherein\nthere was no water, and as the heat of the place became very great the camels died, and the\nservants fled, and I was left alone.  On the third day mine eyes became heavy, and I heard\nas it were a whistling sound, and my spirit went forth from me, and took me into a place of\npunishment to be rewarded according to my works.  And I said unto the judges ‘grant me\npermission to tell you of my doings,’ but they would not listen to me.  And now I pray that\nthou wilt pray to God to have mercy upon me for thy sake.”  And the saint prayed to God\nfor him, and that he might not return to the place of torment.  And he heard a voice, which\nsaid unto him, “I have spared him for thy sake.”  When Abba Stephen heard this he went\ninto his cell weeping, and beating his breast, and he continued his fight until he died. \n[This text is faulty in several places.]\nSalutation to Thy Birth, O Lamp of

and the interpretation of the name of their mother is “Wisdom.”  And when the\nmaidens had grown a little, she took them to the city of Rome, and taught them goodness,\nand piety, and the fear of God, and the doctrine of the Church.  And when the report of her\ncame to the Emperor of Rome, Arianus, the wicked, he commanded [the soldiers] to fetch\nthem and to drag them to him by the hair of their heads; and the soldiers did as the\nemperor commanded.  And their mother exhorted them, and taught them, and urged them\nto endure patiently, and she encouraged them in the Faith of Christ, and said unto them,\n“Take good heed to yourselves, O my daughters, that your hearts become not weary\nthrough considering the honor of this fleeting world, so that ye may not be far from the\nglory which is everlasting.   Endure, O my daughters, so that ye may be with your\nBridegroom Christ, and may enter with Him to the heavenly marriage-feast.”  Now the\ndays of Pistis, the eldest daughter, were twelve years, and the days of Elpis were ten years,\nand the days of ‘Agapis were nine years.  And when they had brought the maidens before\nthe emperor, he commanded them to make Pistis the eldest come near to him, and he said\nunto her, “Hearken unto me and I will give thee in marriage to one of the nobles of my\nempire, and I will show thee much favor; worship Apollo.”  And Pistis reviled him and\ncursed him.   And he commanded the soldiers to beat her with rods, and to cut off her\nbreasts, and to boil pitch and bitumen in a cauldron and to cast her into it; and they did this\nto her.  And she stood up praying in the cauldron, and the fire never touched her, and the\ninterior of the cauldron became like the dew in the mouth of the morning.  And the people\nwho were there marveled, and many of them believed on our Lord Jesus Christ, and the\nsoldiers cut off their heads as they praised God.  Then the governor commanded them to\ncut off the head of Pistis with the sword, [and they did so,] and she received the crown of\nmartyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  And her mother took away her body.  Then\nthey brought forward the second daughter whose name was Elpis, and the soldiers\nscourged her and beat her very severely, and cast her into the boiling cauldron, but the\nheart of the flame became like snow.  Then the emperor commanded them to take her out,\nand to cut off her head, and they did this to her, and she received the crown of martyrdom\nin the kingdom of the heavens; and her mother took away her body.   And Sophia was\nafraid for her youngest daughter lest she should become terrified at the torture, and she\nencouraged her to endure.  And the governor commanded them to torture her on the wheel,\nand they did so, and she cried out to our Lord Jesus Christ to strengthen her and enable her\nto endure; and God sent an angel, and he smashed the wheel.   And the emperor also\ncommanded them to cast her into a red-hot oven, and she made the sign of the Cross over\nher face, and she threw herself into the oven, and straightway it became as cool dew.  And\nthose who were there saw two men in white apparel going about her, and they marveled\nexceedingly; and many of them believed on our Lord Jesus Christ, and the soldiers cut off\ntheir heads and they became martyrs.  Then the governor commanded then to make iron\nrods red-hot in a furnace and to lay them upon her, and God strengthened her to endure\nand the fire did not touch her.  Then he commanded them to cut off her head, and they did\nso, and she received the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  And their\nmother took the bodies of her three daughters, and made them ready for burial, and\nbrought them to a place outside the city, and she sat down and wept over them; and she\nbesought them to ask God to take away her soul, and God received her petition and took\nit.  And certain believers came and made her ready for burial, and they took her body, and\n\nthe bodies of her three daughters, and buried them.  And as for the wicked emperor, God\nsent upon him a disease, and his eyes protruded, and his flesh split open, and his bones\nappeared, and his hands dropped off, amid blood and pus, and worms fell [from him], and\nall his body rotted, and he died an evil death, for God slew (?) him because of the virgins.\nAnd on this day died Abba Minas, the forty-seventh Archbishop of the city of Alexandria.\nGreat tribulation came upon this holy man during the period of his office.  He finished a\ngood fight, and he endured many tribulations, and he pleased God, and he protected his\nflock for nine years and died in peace.  Salutation to Minas.\nAnd on this day also Saint Thecla, and the four virgins who were with her, became\nmartyrs.  And with them there was a certain sinful man, a priest, whose name was Pola,\nand one reported to the governor that he was a rich man, and he commanded [the soldiers]\nto seize his riches.  And Pola came to the governor, and entreated him to restore to him his\npossessions, but he refused.  And he brought the holy virgins to the governor who ordered\nthem to worship the sun, and when they refused the governor said unto Pola the priest, “If\nthou wilt eat a dead body, and drink blood, I will give back to thee thy possessions.”  And\nPola did as the governor commanded him, and he denied Christ.  And when pretexts to kill\nPola were wanted by the governor he said unto him, “If thou wilt make the virgins deny\ntheir Faith I will give back to thee thy possessions.”  And Pola talked to the virgins, and\ntold them what the governor said unto him, and they reviled Pola, saying, “Thou son of\nSatan, thou enemy of righteousness, seeing that thou art out teacher, how canst thou advise\nus to deny Christ?”  When the governor heard their words he commanded the soldiers to\nbeat them with whips, but they neither made answer to the governor, nor did they fear his\ntortures.  And the governor spoke again unto Pola, saying, “If thou wilt kill the virgins I\nwill give back to thee thy possessions.”  When Pola heard this, he worked up his courage\nand he went to kill the virgins, for his heart was filled with love for gold, like that of Judas\nIscariot.  And the virgins said unto him, “O wicked shepherd, how canst thou destroy thy\nsheep because of thy love of money?   We have received from thy hand the Body and\nBlood of Christ.”  And whilst they were saying these words, he cut off their heads with the\nsword, after the manner of a man who is killed in war.  And the governor saw madness of\nPola, and he slew him with the sword and he died, having lost his money and his Faith. \nNow the names of the virgins were Thecla, and Maria, and Martha and her handmaiden,\nand Abeya.  Salutation to Thecla and to the four virgins who were with her.\nAnd on this day also Saint Irene became a martyr.  The father of this saint was Emperor of\nRome, and his name was Marcianus, and he worshipped idols; and her mother was a\nChristian woman.  And having begotten this holy woman her parents built a tower for her,\nand they brought her there with twelve virgins, who wore ornaments of gold and silver;\nand they sent up with her ninety-seven idols for her to worship, and they sealed the door\nupon her, and she remained inside for seven years and seven months.  One day when she\nlifted up her eyes towards the east she saw a dove with an olive branch in her mouth, and\nshe threw the branch on the table; and the saint lifted up her eyes again towards the west,\nand she saw a raven with a serpent in his mouth, which he threw on the table; and she also\nsaw a hawk with a crown in his mouth, which he threw on the table.  And the vision being\nfinished she marveled.  And when her teacher, whom her father the emperor had given her,\ncame and she had related to him the vision, he said unto her, “The dove is the wisdom of\nRome, and the olive branch is the seal of baptism; and the hawk is a strong king, and the\ncrown is good works, and the raven is a weak king; needs must that thou shalt suffer for\nthe Name of Christ.”  When the saint had grown up her father and mother went up to her,\nand they talked with her concerning the matter of her marriage; and Saint Irene said unto\nthem, “Wait for me [to answer] seven days.”  And then she prayed to God that He would\ndirect her into the way, which was right.  And the angel of God came and said unto her,\n“Be strong, and of good courage, and put on strength, for Timothy, the apostle of Paul,\nshall come unto thee, and he shall baptize thee with Christian baptism, and thou shalt\nbecome a martyr.  And Timothy came, and having rent the walls of the house, entered her\npresence, and taught her all the commandments of the Gospel.  Then he brought water, and\nprayed over her, and baptized her in the Name of the Father and the Son and the Holy\nSpirit; and he departed from her.  And having risen up Saint Irene smashed all the idols of\n\nher father.  After seven days her father and her mother came unto her and talked to her as\nbefore, and Saint Irene answered and said, “I have been called by the heavenly King, Jesus\nChrist, and I have been baptized in His Name.”  When her father heard his daughter’s\nwords he was wroth, and he took her down from her upper room and dragged her away,\nand her mother followed her, scattering ashes upon her head as she went.   And he\ncommanded his servants to bring four houses that were bound in chains, and to tie her to\nthem by the hair of her head.  And one of the horses shied because one of the chains cut\nhim, and he cut off the right hand of the emperor, who fell down and died.  And Irene\nhaving risen up and prayed, lifted up the dead, and she made his hand to be as it had been\nformerly.  And when the people saw this they and her father believed on the Lord Jesus\nChrist, and three thousand souls were baptized by her hands.  When the Emperor Decius\nheard of her he came into that city and seized Saint Irene, and he commanded the soldiers\nto hang her up by her hair, and they did so.  Then he commanded them to cast her into a\ndeep pit filled with serpents and scorpions; and by the power of God they all died.  And he\nalso commanded them to saw her in halves with a saw, but the saw broke and the wicked\nemperor died.  And when the son of the emperor heard this he attacked the city, and he\nseized Saint Irene, and he commanded the soldiers to drive sharp nails through her hands\nand her feet, and to heap up a great quantity of sand on her back, and to tie her to the tails\nof four horses, in order to destroy her body; but they were unable to vanquish her with all\nthese tortures.  As for that wicked man, the angel of God killed him with a spear of fire. \nAnd Saint Irene healed the sick, and even raised the dead.  And a fourth emperor who\nheard about her, had her brought into his presence, and he pressed her to offer to the gods;\nand when she refused to do so he commanded them to cast her into the fire, and she came\nout of the fire and cursed the emperor.  And when he saw the miracle he himself believed\non Christ.  And the King of Persia came to the city, and he seized Saint Irene, and drove\nhis spear into her with his own hands, and she died; and the angel of God came and raised\nher up, and she came into the city preaching in the Name of Christ.  And after a few days\nshe was caught up into the Garden of Delight.  Salutation to Irene.\nAnd on this day also died Gregory the Theologian.\nAnd on this day also died Abba ‘Akresteros (Christopher) the fighter.  This saint lived in\nthe desert of the Jordan, and one of the monks bowed before him and entreated him,\nsaying, “O my father ‘Akresteros (Christopher), do me an act of grace, and describe to me\nall thy manner of life and work so that I may profit thereby.”  And the elder said unto him,\n“O my son, when I became a monk I was a young man, and I used to go by night to the\nsanctuary (or, church) of Saint Theodosius to pray there.  In it were eighteen steps, and on\neach step I used to make one hundred prostrations until they blew the horn.   Then\nstraightway I would go into the church, and finish my Rule with the brethren, and I\ncontinued to do this for ten years.  One day after I had finished my usual prayers, my mind\nwas carried away captive, and I saw two men in white raiment trimming the lamps; one\nhalf of them they left lighted and the other half they extinguished.  And I said unto them,\n‘What is this thing?’ And these fathers said unto me, ‘The lamp of the man who loveth his\nbrother burneth.’  And I said unto them, ‘Of which kind is my lamp?’ And they said unto\nme, ‘Thou lovest thy brethren, and we keep thy lamp alight.’”   Then ‘Akresteros\n(Christopher) went into the monastery of Sina by himself, and he dwelt there for fifty\nyears, the whole time fighting the spiritual fight.   And a voice came unto him, saying,\n“Return to thy monastery so that thou mayest be with thy fathers”; then he returned to his\nmonastery, and died in peace.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated the righteous who fled.\nSalutation to ‘Akresteros (Christopher).\nSalutation to the many thousands of souls who looking on at Irene believed on the Lord\nJesus Christ.  [The Bodleian MS. gives the number as 130,030.]\nHere endeth that which is to be read during the month of Ter in the peace of God, to\nWhom be glory forever and ever.  Amen.\n\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and another reason was Apollinarius, the infidel,\nwho said, “The only flesh which the Son took was the flesh which appertaineth absolutely\nto the animal, and which is without a rational and understanding soul, and His Godhead\nwas to Him instead of soul and heart (understanding).”  And these three having made this\nshameful denial, the fathers gathered together to the emperor, and asked him to convene a\nCouncil to consider the denial of these three infidels, and he assented to their words.  And\nstraightway he sent a letter to Damalis, Archbishop of the city of Rome, and Meliton,\nArchbishop of the city of Antioch, and to Cyril, Bishop of the city of Jerusalem, and he\ncommanded them to bring with them the bishops who were associated with them in their\ncountries.   And these fathers, namely One Hundred and Fifty bishops, came and their\nassembly took place in the city of Constantinople.   Now the Archbishop of the city of\nRome did not come, but certain learned men came in his stead, and they brought with them\na letter written with his own hand.   The head and chief of this Council was Timothy,\nArchbishop of the city of Alexandria, and he called Macedonius, and commanded him to\nexpound his unclean Faith.  And that infidel said, “The Holy Spirit is a created thing, like\nall other created things.”  And Timothy answered him and said, “With us the Holy Spirit is\nthe Spirit of God, and is uncreated, and we do not consider the life of God to be a created\nthing; he who saith this hath no life in him.  And thou sayest that He is created.  Now, it is\nbetter for thee to turn from this shameful denial, before thou art punished in Gahannum\nand everlasting fire.”   But Macedonius would neither hearken nor repent, and Timothy\nanathematized him and excommunicated him, and he cut him off from his office, and\ndrove him forth.   Then Timothy said unto Basilius, “Declare thy opinion, O evil and\nunclean man!”  And he said, “The Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit are One Person,\nand One Being.”  And Abba Timothy answered and said unto him, “If it be that the Three\nHoly Ones are One Being, as thou sayest in thy madness, behold the mention of the Three\nis destroyed, and thy Christian baptism is destroyed, for thou wast baptized in the Name of\nthe Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, and thou hast denied the Holy Three, as thou\nsayest in thy madness.  Did the Holy Three become incarnate, and suffer and die?  Are the\nwords which are in the Holy Gospel to have no effect which say, The Son stood in the\nJordan, and the Spirit descended upon Him overshadowing Him, and the Father cried out\nfrom heaven, saying, This is My Son, Whom I love, hear ye Him?  It is best for thee to\nrepent of thy evil denial.  Arius denieth the Son, and Macedonius denieth the Holy Spirit,\nand thou art a partner with them, for thou deniest both the Son and the Holy Spirit.”  But\nSables would not repent, neither would he hearken unto him, and Timothy anathematized\nhim and excommunicated him, and cut him off [from his office], and drove him forth. \nThen Timothy said unto Apollinarius, “Expound thy evil and shameful opinion.”  And he\nsaid in his madness, “The only flesh which the Son took was the flesh which appertaineth\nabsolutely to the animal, and which is without a rational and understanding soul, and [His\nGodhead] was to Him in the place of a heart and soul [understanding].”  And Timothy\nanswered and said unto him, “God the Word took flesh of our nature, and He became one\nwith us, so that He might deliver us; and if it be that the only flesh He took was that which\nappertaineth absolutely to the animal, and is without a rational and understanding soul,\n\nthen it followeth that He cannot save the children of men, but only animals, according to\nwhat thou sayest in thy madness.  For the children of men shall not rise up in the day of\nthe resurrection, except as rational and understanding souls, and with them shall rise their\nbodies, according to their deeds, whether it be for punishment, or whether it be for joy. \nAnd, according to thy madness, shall the operation of His wisdom, and His Incarnation, be\ndestroyed?  And how did He say concerning Himself, that He was not one with a rational\nand understanding soul?  It is better for thee to repent of this evil counsel, and this polluted\ninfidelity.”   But Apollinarius would not turn, and he would not hearken, and Timothy\nanathematized him and excommunicated him, and cut him off [from his office], with these\nthree (sic) others.  And he excommunicated these three infidels by the mouths of all the\nOne Hundred and Fifty holy bishops of the Council, and he excommunicated those who\nfollowed them, and those who believed their words.  And then they added to the prayer of\nthe Faith the words, “We believe in the Holy Spirit,” on to the end. Now the Three\nHundred and Eighteen fathers had drawn up [the prayer of the Faith] without [these\nwords], as far as the place where it saith, “And there is no end of His kingdom.”  And at\nthe place where they made the prayer of the Faith to end, these One Hundred and Fifty\nfathers added the words “And there is no end of His kingdom.”  Then they drew up at this\nGeneral Council a Canon, and subscribed it with their hands, and to this day all Christian\npeoples observe their Law.  Now the assembling of these One Hundred and Fifty fathers\nand bishops took place in the five thousand eight hundred and eighty-second year since the\ncreation of the world.  Salutation to the General Council of Constantinople.\nAnd on this day also is celebrated the festival of the consecration of the church which was\nbuilt in the name of Saint Peter, the archbishop, who excommunicated Arius.  Now he\nbecame a martyr in the city of Alexandria, at the end of the reign of Diocletian, the\ninfidel.   When Constantine began to reign he destroyed the houses of idols, and built\nchurches, and the believers built a church to the west of the city of Alexandria in the name\nof Saint Peter; and it was consecrated as it were this day; and many signs and miracles\ntook place therein.  And the church existed until the Muslims ruled in the land of Egypt. \nAfter they had ruled for many days, the church of the west [of the city] became well\nknown, and then it was pulled down and laid in ruins; but the church of the blessed Peter,\nwhich is in the heavens, is strong, and no injury shall ever come upon it.  Salutation to the\nconsecration of thy church, O Peter.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated the deaths of ‘Askenafer and his wife.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and God wrought many signs and\nwonders by their hands, and they received praise and honor from men.   And Saint\nLonginus went forth from his teacher, by his advice, and came to the country of Egypt, and\nwhen he arrived at the monastery of Zegag, the monks welcomed him with joy, and he\ndwelt in that monastery until its abbot died.  When the monks knew of the spiritual fight of\nthe saint, and his good qualities, and virtues, and righteousness, they appointed him abbot\nof the monastery of Zegag.   A few days later his teacher, the monk Abba Lucianus,\narrived.  And they used to make roofs of boats (awnings?), and they lived on the work of\ntheir hands; and they dwelt together, single-heartedly, for many days, and God performed\nmany signs and miracles by their hands.   And then Abba Lucianus died.   Now the\nassembling of the Council of Chalcedon took place in the days of Marcianus, the infidel,\nand he sent messengers into all the countries with the Book of the unclean Faith, which\nattributed to Christ two Natures.  And three of his envoys having come to the monastery of\nZegag, and given a copy of that Book to Abba Longinus, they said unto him, “The\nEmperor Marcianus hath commanded that ye shall believe what is written in this Book.” \nAnd Saint Longinus said, “I can do nothing without the advice of the holy fathers; come\nwith me that we may take counsel [with them].”  And he brought the messengers of the\nemperor into the cave wherein were the bodies of the holy elders, and he laid that Book\nupon them, and he said unto them, “O my fathers, say ye not that ye have lain down in\ndeath, and are at peace.   Behold, they have brought this Book wherein is written the\nunclean Faith, which assigneth to Christ two Natures.  Do ye command me to subscribe\nthereto, and to believe its words, or not?  If ye do not tell me what I shall do, as God\nliveth, I will cast out your bones from this place.”  And a voice came forth from their\nbodies, and all the men heard it, saying, “Forsake thou not the True Faith of our fathers the\nApostles, and of our fathers the Three Hundred and Eighteen; and follow not the unclean\nBook, and remove it from our bodies.”  And when the envoys of the emperor heard these\nwords they marveled exceedingly, and fear and great trembling fell upon them, and they\ndid not return to the emperor, but they shaved the hair of their heads, and became monks in\nthat monastery; and they lived there for many years and died there.  And Saint Longinus\nhaving finished his good fight, at a ripe old age, and pleased God, died in peace, and\nreceived a crown of martyrdom.\nAnd on this day also died Abba Pawli (Paul) who was the greatest of all the desert monks,\nand the equal of the angels who keep vigil.   This saint was a native of the city of\nAlexandria, and his name was Pawli (Paul), and he had a brother whose name was Peter,\nand their father was a rich man.  And the multitude of his possessions, of gold, and silver,\nand costly apparel, was countless.   And when their parents died, and the days of their\nmourning for them were ended, the two brothers began to divide their inheritance from\ntheir father; and Pawli’s (Paul’s) brother Peter took the larger share, and assigned to Pawli\n(Paul) the lesser share.  And the heart of Pawli (Paul) was sad about this, and he said unto\nhis brother, “Why dost thou not give me my share of the inheritance of my father?”  And\nPeter answered and said unto him, “Thou art a young man, and will squander thy money,\n\nand I will take care of it for thee until thou art grown up.”  Thereupon Pawli (Paul) became\nwroth, and the two brothers quarreled together, and they went to the governor, so that he\nmight do justice to each.  And as they were going along, they met a dead man, and he was\nready for the tomb, and men were carrying him on a bier, and many men were following\nhim and making lamentation for him.  And straightway Saint Pawli (Paul) called to one of\nthose who were following the dead man, and said unto him, “Who is this that hath died\nthis day?”  And the man said unto him, “He is a very well-known man, my son.  He who\ndied this day was a rich man, and he lived delicately, and possessed gold and silver, and\nbehold, he hath left all this, and he goeth naked to the grave, in a sea of sins, by the road\non which he shall never return.  And now, O my son, it is meet for us to fight for the\nsalvation of our souls, for we know not when we shall die.  But, blessed is the man who\nhath dominion and money in this world!  And let him abandon riches if he would received\ngreat honor in the heavenly Jerusalem, the city of all the saints.”  When Abba Pawli (Paul)\nheard these words he cried out in his heart, saying, “What have I to do with the\npossessions of this fleeting world, which after a few days I must leave, and depart\nnaked?”  Then he turned to his brother, and said unto him, “Let us go back together to our\nhouse, for from this time onward I will never speak again about money.”  Then he fled\nfrom his brother, and went outside the city, and he went into a grave and sat down inside it,\nand for three days and three nights he prayed and entreated God to guide him into the\n[right] way.   And his brother passed many days in going round about through all the\nvillages seeking for him, but he found him not; and he sorrowed for him with a very great\nsorrow.  And whilst Saint Pawli (Paul) was sitting in that tomb for three days, he did not\nremember food and drink, and fear and terror did not assail him, for the might of God\novershadowed him.  And on the fourth day God sent His angel to him, and he caught him\nup from the grave, and carried him into the Inner Desert, towards the east, and he set him\ndown in that place by the side of a well of water; and then the angel embraced him, and\nwent up into [heaven].  And Saint Abba Pawli (Paul) found a cave wherein wild beasts\nlived, and he entered therein.  And he made himself garments of palm fiber, and put them\non, and he prayed, saying, “O my Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the Living God, keep me, and\ndeliver me from the hand of the Enemy, who is merciless.  And let Thy mercy come upon\nme, and strengthen Thou me, so that I may finish my fight, through Thy good pleasure, O\nKing of all the generations of men, for to Thee belong power and glory for ever.”  And he\nlived in that cave for eighty years, and he never saw a man.  And his apparel was [made\nof] cloth made of palm fiber.  And God used to send unto him daily at eventide, a raven,\nwhich had with him half a loaf of bread, and he would give it to Pawli (Paul).  And when\nGod wished to make manifest the holiness and righteousness of Pawli (Paul), He sent an\nangel to the great father Abba Anthony, who thought in his heart that he was the first who\ndwelt in the desert.  And the angel came to Abba Anthony and said unto him, “In the Inner\nDesert, distant from thee two days’ journey, there is a man for whose feet the men of the\nworld are not meet to be a footstool.  Through his prayers the world is kept in a right\ncourse, and the earth giveth its fruit.  Through him the dew falleth on the earth, and the sun\nriseth upon all the sinners of the earth, and because of his goodness God beareth all the\ncreation of the children of men.”  And when Abba Anthony heard these words he rose up,\nand went into the Inner Desert, believing that God was with him, and that He would make\nstraight his road.  And he found the footprints of a man, and the footprints of many wild\nbeasts, and sheep, and cattle, about the footprints of the man, [and he followed them] till\nhe arrived at his cave; and he heard the holy man singing in his cave.  And Abba Anthony\ntook up a stone, and knocked at the door of the cave therewith.  And when Saint Pawli\n(Paul) heard him knocking, he thought that it was some work of Satan, and he took up a\nlarge stone, and set it against the end of the bolt, which fastened the door of his cave. \nWhen Anthony heard [this] he cried out, and said, “I have sought and it was given unto me\nto find, I have asked and I have received, I have knocked and it hath been opened to me.” \nAnd straightway Abba Pawli (Paul) opened the door to him, and brought him in, and each\nembraced the other with a spiritual embrace, and they prayed together and sat down.  And\nAnthony said unto him, “What is thy name, O my father?”  And the blessed elder Abba\nPawli (Paul) answered, and said unto him, “If thou dost not know my name, why hast thou\njourneyed [to] this place?”  And at that moment God opened the heart of Anthony, and he\nsaid unto him, “Blessed am I that I was held worthy to see the second Pawli (Paul).”  And\n\nwhilst they were talking together about the greatness of God, behold a raven came at\neventide, and dropped down to the saint a whole bread cake.  And Abba Pawli (Paul) said\nunto Abba Anthony, “Now do I know that thou art a man of God.  Behold, I have been\nliving in this desert until to-day eighty years, and each day God hath sent unto me half a\nbread-cake, and behold to-day He hath sent thy food.”   And after this they rose up\ntogether, and prayed until the star in the west appeared, when they sat down and ate.  And\nafter they had eaten they rose up and prayed and glorified God until the dawn broke.  And\nwhen they saw the light of the dawn and that the sun had risen, they embraced each other. \nAnd Anthony said unto Pawli (Paul), “O my father, where hast thou received the Holy\nMysteries during all the days wherein thou hast been living in this desert?”  And Saint\nAbba Pawli (Paul) answered and said unto him, “God sent to me His angel, and he\nadministered to me the Holy Mysteries each day preceding the Sabbath, and on the First\nDay of the week, and then he went up to heaven; and he worketh for me each day.”  And\nAnthony said unto him, “I want thee to inform me about the garb of the monks--will it\nincrease on earth, or not?”  And the blessed man smiled, and uttered a cry of grief.  And\nAnthony said unto him, “When I see thee smiling, I smile also, and rejoice thereat; but\nwhen thou utterest a cry of grief I feel sad.”  And Saint Pawli (Paul) answered and said\nunto him, “These mountains and deserts shall become like the habitation of doves, and\nGod shall gather together into them His chosen ones from among all the monks; and this\nname of ‘chosen one’ shall change, and their name shall be ‘monks.’   And they shall\nrejoice many days, and God shall remove them before [the coming of] wrath.  After them\nthere shall rise up a generation of men who will neither hear nor submit to their teachers,\nand who will not keep vigil at night for their soul’s sake.  Then shall God be wroth with\nthe mountains and deserts, and He will despoil them of the wicked folk who have neither\nheart nor Law; and the mountains and the deserts shall be waste for many days.  But the\nmemorial of the saints shall not perish.  And God shall pour compassion into the hearts of\nother men, and they shall go to the mountains and deserts, and dwell in them, [and they\nshall be inhabited] a second time.  And Satan shall go into the mountains (or, monasteries),\nand cause war in their midst, and they shall cast aside the garb of the monk, and shall go\ndown into the world, for they shall not find the strength of the love of God, and they shall\nnot endure therein; for it is written, ‘By patience ye shall make yourselves to possess your\nsouls’ (Isaiah xxx,15).”  And Anthony said unto him, “Blessed be the day, O my father,\nwherein I was held worthy to see thy face, O blessed Abba Pawli (Paul).”  And Saint Abba\nPawli (Paul) said unto him, “Rise up now and depart to thy habitation, and bring with thee\nthe garment which Constantine gave unto Athanasius, the Archbishop, and which Abba\nAthanasius put upon thee, so that thou mayest bury my body therein.”   And Anthony\nmarveled at his words and his mention of the garment of the archbishop, and he believed\nall the prophecies, which he had prophesied to him.  And Saint Abba Pawli (Paul) said\nunto him, “Make haste, and stand not, for the time of my going forth is nigh, as unto all\nmen.”  When Anthony heard this he was greatly frightened, and he wept; and he went out\nfrom him, and journeyed for two days and two nights, until he came to his abode.  And he\ntook the garment and went back, and as he was on the road he saw Abba Bula (Pawli)\n(Paul) and the company of the angels singing praises in the air, and they said, “Glory be to\nGod.”  And they said also, “Peace be unto thee, O thou chosen one of God, our Lord Jesus\nChrist, thou blessed father, Abba Pawli (Paul), thou man of God; the angels rejoice with\nthee, for thou shalt rejoice in the kingdom of the heavens.  Darkness hath left thee and they\nshall take thee to the country of light; sorrow hath left thee, and they shall take thee to the\njoy, which is forever.  Blessed art thou in thy generation, O thou Pawli (Paul), the desert\nmonk, thou man of God, thou Pawli (Paul), the desert monk.”  And when they had said\nthese words of praise they disappeared.  And the blessed Anthony said, “This is the soul of\nmy father Abba Pawli (Paul) kneeling on his knees with his face [to the ground], and his\nhands were spread out like a cross.  And he took him up and he seemed to be alive, and he\ncovered him over, and wept over him, saying, “Remember me, O my father, in the\nhabitations of heaven wherein thou wilt dwell.”   Then Saint Anthony took him, and\nwrapped his body up in that garment, and he took the Book and fulfilled over him the\nCanon of the Law of the Church, and he prayed over him three times, and read over him\nthe Four Gospels.   And he took up his garment made of the hair of a mule, and he\nwondered what he should do with it, for he had no digging tool with him.  and straightway\n\nthere came unto him two lions, and they bowed low before the body of Saint Pawli (Paul),\nand they saluted him.  And Abba Anthony was dismayed and was afraid when he saw the\nlions, and the lions bent their heads to Anthony, as if they were asking him a question, and\nthey licked his feet as if they had known him before, and they made signs to him as if they\nwould say unto him, “Where shall we dig a grave for him?”   And Abba Anthony\nunderstood their signs, and he measured out for them a space as long as the body of Pawli\n(Paul), and he showed them how deep the pit was to be, and the two lions dug, one\ntowards the head and the other towards the feet, for a space of four cubits.  And Anthony\nmade a sign to them and said unto them, “This is enough for you”; and the lions came up\nout of the grave, and they crouched before Abba Anthony as if they would say, “Forgive\nus, and remember us, and bless us.”  And he blessed them, and they went away from him,\nand Saint Anthony wrapped up the body of Saint Abba Pawli (Paul) and buried him.  And\nafter this he took the head-cloth, and the pallet, of Abba Pawli (Paul), and his garment\nmade of mule’s hair, like a son who inheriteth the possessions of his father.  And he set a\nmark on the place where his grave was, and he journeyed on foot and departed from the\neast until he arrived at the city of Alexandria, facing the west.   And he went into the\npresence of Abba Athanasius the Archbishop, and he told him what had happened to Saint\nAbba Pawli (Paul).  And when the archbishop heard the story of the saint he rejoiced and\ntook the garment of the blessed Abba Pawli (Paul), and laid it up by him; and he wore it\nthree times a year, namely on the festival of the Epiphany, on the festival of the\nResurrection of the Redeemer, and on the festival of the Great Ascension.   And the\narchbishop sent priests, and deacons, and men, with Abba Anthony, and carts with them to\nfetch the body of Saint Abba Pawli (Paul).  And they went round about in the mountains\nfor many days without finding the grave of the saint, for it was hidden from them [by the\nsand].  And Saint Abba Pawli (Paul) appeared unto the Archbishop Abba Athanasius, and\nsaid unto him, “Send a messenger to bring back the men, and let them not labor [in vain],\nfor God doth not wish any man to see me until the appearance of the Lord Christ”; and the\narchbishop sent a messenger and brought back the men.  And one day God willed to make\nmanifest the glory of the Abba Pawli’s (Paul’s) cloak of mule’s hair.  And at that time a\ncertain young man of the city of Alexandria, who was a Christian, died.  “Now believe me,\nO Christian folk, I, your father Atanasius, took this garment of mule’s hair which belonged\nto the blessed Abba Pawli (Paul), and laid it upon the dead man, and he rose up\nstraightway.  I, Athanasius, who have been appointed chief in the Church, saw this with\nmy own eyes.  And I, Isidore the bishop, was a witness of this thing.  And I, Anthony, who\nwas first appointed a priest by the hand of Abba Athanasius, am a witness of this thing,\nand I have subscribed this statement.”  And two or three other men testified that this was\ntrue.  And the story of this miracle was noised about throughout all the countries of Egypt,\nand in the city of Alexandria, and all men marveled, and glorified God, Who worketh\nmiracles by His saints.  Salutation to Abba Pawli (Paul).\nAnd on this day Thomas made manifest a miracle when he went forth to preach where our\nLord commanded him to go.  And when he drew nigh thereto, and had come within two\nstadia of the city, he turned aside from the road and saw by chance a dead young man, and\nhis appearance was very godly.  And the apostle said, “My Lord, was it that I might\nexperience this trial that Thou didst bring me hither?  But Thy Will be done.”  And having\nsaid this he prayed much for the dead man, and straightway there came forth from the side\nof a stone a great serpent which lashed the ground with its tail, and cried out with a loud\nvoice, saying, “What have I to do with thee, O apostle of Christ, thou hast come to annul\nmy work?”  And the apostle said unto him, “Yea, speak.”  And the serpent said, “There\nwas a beautiful woman [who came] from the vineyard, and I saw her and loved her.  Then\nI found this young man kissing her, and consorting with her on the day of the Sabbath; but\nit is unnecessary for me to describe before thee all the wickedness, which he committed.  I\nknew that he was an associate of Christ, and therefore I killed him.”  And the Satan who\nruled over the serpent told the apostle all the evil, which he used to do to the children of\nmen.  Then the apostle anathematized him in the Name of Jesus Christ, and commanded\nhim to withdraw the poison from the [dead] man.  And straightway the serpent blew\nhimself out, and burst asunder and died, and the young man leaped up and embraced the\nfeet of the apostle and recovered.  And in this place the apostle made the people to believe,\n\nand he built them a church.  Then the apostle went into the city with the young man whom\nhe had raised from the dead, and as they were standing and talking to the people of that\nplace, a young ass came and stood before him, and he opened his mouth and said, “O\nassociate of Christ, and apostle of the Most High, who knoweth the things which are\nhidden, thou companion of the Son of God, come return thou to Him that sent thee, God. \nGet up, and mount upon my back, and rest until thou enterest the city.”  And when the\napostle heard him he marveled exceedingly, and he praised God, and said unto the ass, “To\nwhat race dost thou belong that thou speaketh such deep mysteries?”  And the ass  said\nunto him, “I am a descendant of the offspring of the ass which was in the service of\nBalaam, and the ass whereon thy Lord and Teacher rode was descended from him, and was\nmy father.  Now as for me, I have been sent to give thee rest and for thee to mount upon”;\nand the apostle refused to mount upon him.  And when the ass had made many entreaties\nto him, the apostle mounted upon him, and he came to the gates of the city with many\npeople following him; and he alighted from the ass, and said unto him, “Depart, and take\nheed whither thou departest,” and straightway the ass fell down and died.  And those who\nsaw this were dismayed, and they said unto the apostle, “Make him to live and raise him\nup.”  And the apostle said unto them, “I could raise him up by the power of my God, but it\nis better for him so”; and he commanded them to dig a hole in the ground, and to bury\nhim, and then he gave them the salutation of peace and departed from them.  Salutation to\nThomas.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and he\nnever went out from his cell, or entered a city, for a period of fifteen years, and he never\nlooked upon the face of a woman.  And certain evil men who were among the followers of\nDiabolus made a plan against him, and they caused a certain harlot to go to the saint, and\nshe went into his cell to him, and she made lewd gestures before him, and invited him to\nwork sin with her.   And the saint warned her about the fire of Gahannum, and the\npunishment, which is forever, and through him she repented, and fought the spiritual fight\nand pleased God.  And after this Satan made a plot against him, and he entered into the\nheart of a daughter of a certain nobleman of the city, and he cast her down on the ground,\nand rolled her over, and Satan put into the heart of her father [the idea] that no one could\nheal her except Jacob the monk in the cell.  And her father took her, and brought her to the\nsaint, and he asked him to heal her by his prayers; and the saint prayed over her, and she\nwas healed straightway, but her father was afraid to take her away at once, saying that the\nSatan might come back to her.  And the father left her with the saint, and her brother who\nwas a little boy with her, and departed.  Then Satan took up war against the saint by night\nand by day, and at length he made him to fall into sin with her.  And having fallen into sin\nwith her he became afraid lest the sin should be made manifest, and that the people would\nkill him because of it, and he killed the woman and her brother.  Thereupon Satan cast\ndespair in his heart, and he went forth from his cell to go into the world.  And He Who\ndesireth not the death of a sinner had compassion upon him, and He sent a righteous monk\nunto him, and the holy man found him on the road as he was journeying along, and he\nwelcomed him and embraced him.  When he saw that Jacob was sad and sorry, he asked\nhim, saying, “What hath happened to thee?  What maketh thee sad?”  And Jacob told him\neverything, which had happened, how he had fallen through that maiden, and how he had\nkilled her and her brother.  And that righteous monk said unto him, “Fear not, be strong,\nand cut not off hope, for God is compassionate and merciful”; and then he laid upon him\nfasting, and prayer, and prostrations.  And Jacob went back and entered his cell, and shut\nhimself in, and he endured great toil and tribulation; and he fasted frequently and prayed,\nand kept vigil and made many prostrations.  And he always ate grass, and the herbs of the\nearth, and he sorrowed in his heart, and was sad, and said, “Will God accept me and\nforgive me my sin?”  And he continued to fight, and repented deeply for forty years.  And\nGod willed to reveal to him that He had accepted his repentance, and He brought a great\nfamine upon the city that year, and said unto the Bishop of that city, “The famine will only\npass away through the prayer of Jacob, the monk who is in a pit.”  And the bishop rose up\nstraightway, and took with him the priests and people of the city, and they came to Saint\nJacob, and asked him to pray on their behalf, that God would have mercy upon them and\nbring down rain.  And he refused, saying, “I am a sinner and a wrongdoer, and I have\nprovoked God to wrath with my sins”; and the bishop told him what God had said\nconcerning him.  And straightway he submitted to the bishop, and he went out with the\npeople and he prayed, and wept, saying, “They think that Jacob is a man,” and his prayer\nwas with tears.  And he said unto God, “How can I show my unclean face before Thy\nholiness, O God?  How can I lift up my face which is blackened with much sin to the\nheaven of Thy holiness?”  And he prayed a long time, and before he finished his prayer\nmuch rain fell, and he knew that God had accepted his prayer and his repentance, and had\nforgiven him his sin.  And after this he doubled his fasting, and his prayers, and vigils, and\nprostrations, and he admonished himself, saying, “Fight and take care that thou dost not\n\nfall a second time.”  And he ended his days at a good old age, and he pleased God and died\nin peace.  Salutation to Jacob.\nAnd on this day also took place the translation of the body of Abba Ephraim, the Syrian. \nSalutation to the translation of thy body, O Ephraim.\nAnd on this day also took place the death of Abba Ebelo, the chief of the anchorites,\nthrough whose virtues flourished the fruit of the Faith.  When Athanasius, Archbishop of\nAlexandria, returned, Basil, Bishop of Caesarea, came to him, and the two of them passed\nthe night in the church of ‘Abukir.  And as they were talking together about the saints who\nwere in the religious houses of Egypt, the father archbishop said, “Abba Pachomius [is the\ngreatest saint],” and Basil said, “Abba Anthony, and Abba Amoni [are the greatest\nsaints].”  And whilst they were talking thus, and wishing to know rightly [who was the\ngreatest saint], Abba Athanasius saw a vision on the fifth day of Yakatit, at midnight, of a\ngreat tree, [the roots of] which reached as far as the river, and the branches of which\nreached to heaven; and many men sheltered themselves under the branches thereof; and in\nthe midst thereof was a Tabot (altar).  And whilst he was rendered silent by the vision,\nMichael came down from heaven, and said unto him, “Tell this vision to Basil.”  And Basil\nsaw even as Athanasius saw, the tree and the altar and the angels.  And Michael interpreted\nthe matter to them, saying, “The tree which ye saw is the monastery of Abba Ebelo, which\nis built on the border of Egypt, and the branches thereof are the monks.  And the altar is\nthe church, which the angels visit, and it is the similitude of Peter because it destroyeth\n[evil] spirits.   And a certain prefect of the city of Alexandria heard the story of Abba\nEbelo, and he entreated the archbishop to send him to him so that he might receive a\nblessing from him.  And the father archbishop sent him with seven monks, that is to say,\nIsidore, and John the Less, and Abba Besoy, and Abba Amoni, and Victor, and Agrinicus,\nand Abba Kalnas.  And Abba Ebelo rose up and went, and met them with joy, and the\nprefect who had come with the brethren, who was one-eyed, embraced Abba Ebelo, and\nshowed [him] his eye, and cried out, saying, “O bright star in the world!”  Then the prefect\nsaid unto Abba Ebelo, “My wife labored with leprosy; she is under thy garb (i.e. she is a\nnun), and may the grace which hath found me find her.”  And Abba Ebelo said unto her,\n“Healing shall be to her!”  And she found health.  One day Abba Ebelo stood up among\nthe monks, and said unto them, “Let each one of you be certain that our Redeemer will\ncome with His disciples to make us to know where the site of the church is to be.”  And\nwhen it became daylight [on the morrow], Jesus Christ came, and His disciples and His\nangels were with Him, and He showed them where to lay the foundations of the building\nof the church.  And Abba Ebelo exhorted his sons to be perfect in every good work, and to\ndwell in love; and whilst he was exhorting them his face changed, and his whole body\nburned, and light beamed forth from his face, as from that of an angel of God.  And when\nhis sons were afraid he said unto them, “Fear ye not, I am saying farewell unto you.”  And\nhaving said this his soul was caught up, and a beautiful perfume spread itself about, and\nstraightway his eye were opened, and he said, “O my Lord Jesus Christ, help me, and\nreceive my soul to Thee”; and having said this he delivered up his soul into the hand of\nGod.\nAnd on this day also died Zenon, the worker of wonders.  This saint having gone into the\nsanctuary (i.e. the temple) of Jerusalem to pray, came out and went to Imahus (Emmaus),\nto a holy elder, and after they had saluted each other they sat down and began to tell stories\nof the great deeds of God until the sixth hour.  And there was in that city a certain believer,\nwho used to visit the elder [and take him] bread and water.  One day when he was carrying\nhis food to him, one told him that his son was dead, and he took him and wrapped him up\nin cloth and laid him in a coffer, on the top of which he placed the elder’s food; and his\nwife followed him.  When he came to the elder he found Abba Zenon with him, and he set\nthe coffer before them, and asked them to pray.  And they talked together, and one said,\n“Do thou pray,” and the other said, “Do thou pray”; and the elder made Abba Zenon to\npray.  And he began his prayer thus:  “O Lord, Sustainer of the Universe, compassionate\nand merciful, these are the things which Thy servants the poor offer unto Thee as their\nFirst-fruits.”  And with the end of these words the dead child rose up, and wept in the\ncoffer.  Then the father of the child cast himself down at the feet of Abba Zenon, and he\n\nsaid unto him, “Forgive me, O my father, for speaking unto thee, but this my son, who was\ndead, hath risen up through thy prayer.”  And Abba Zenon feared the adulation of men, and\nhe said unto him, “O my son, reveal this thing to no man whatsoever until I die.”  And he\nfled from that place without eating, and returned to his own habitation, and after fighting\nmany spiritual fights he died.  Salutation to Zenon.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and he\nwas a priest in the city of Alexandria.  And when father Claudian, the archbishop who\npreceded him, died, the people of the city of Alexandria chose this father and made him\narchbishop.   And having been set over the Church of God on the throne of Mark the\nevangelist, he followed a good course of life like the Apostles, and he preached and taught\nthe Christian Faith, and the life-giving Law, and he watched the people with his eyes, and\nshepherded his flock and helped them.  He took no trouble to become possessed of one\nsilver dirham, or one dinar, and he only ate because he was hungry, and he dressed only to\nprotect his body against cold and heat.  And he read the Scriptures frequently to his people,\nand he taught them, both great and small, and he kept vigil and prayed for them all; and he\ncontinued this strife for twelve years and he pleased God and died in peace.  Salutation to\n‘Akrepinu (‘Akrepos), who succeeded Claudian.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Besoy, who was called “Peter.”  This holy\nman came from Upper Egypt, from the city of ‘Akhim (Akhmim).  In the days of his early\nmanhood he used to do works of abomination, and to eat and drink luxuriously.  When\nGod chose him He brought upon him a severe illness, and he well-nigh died and delivered\nup his spirit, and He showed him the places of punishment, and the great deep pits of hell,\nand he saw men clothed in shining apparel, and in their hands they had the body of a man\nwhich they tore into four pieces.  And they said unto Besoy, “Thus will they do unto every\nman who stealeth the possessions of men.”  When he heard this word he was sorrowful in\nhis heart, and he wept a bitter weeping, and his soul returned to his body, and he lifted up\nhis eyes to heaven and said, “O my Lord and God, if Thou wilt heal me of this sickness, I\nwill repent of this my sin, and I will worship Thee with all my heart, and from this time\nforward I will never look at a woman again.”  And straightway God healed him of his\nsickness, and he rose up and went to Dabra Banwayet, and the monks counseled him, and\nthey arrayed him in the garb of the monk.  And he fought a great fight with fasting, and\nprayer, and vigils for many years, until his fame was heard of throughout Egypt; and he\nexcelled among many saints, and he composed many Homilies and Admonitions, and\nTeachings for the monks and for the laity.  And he fasted a month at a time, and neither ate\nbread nor drank water; and continued to fight the fight in this manner for a period of five\nand thirty years.  And he used to stand up all night in prayer.  And the works of men were\nmanifest before him, whether righteous or sinners; and after this he became a little sick\nand he died in peace.  Salutation to Besoy who was called Peter.\nAnd on this day died the holy father Nob, the owner of the fan (?) of gold.  Salutation to\nNob with his fan (?) of gold, the driver away of wild beasts.\nAnd on this day also died Abba Eblo, who was like unto an angel of God.  And behold we\nhave written his history in the section for the twenty-fifth day of the month of Tekemt. \nSalutation to Abba ‘Eblo.\nAnd on this day also took place the translation of the bodies of the forty-nine elders\n(monks) who became martyrs in the desert of Scete, in the monastery of Abba Macarius. \nSalutation to the translation of the holy bones to the cave, which was built for them under\nthe care of Benyami.\n\nAnd on this day also died Saint ‘Abulidis, Archbishop of the city of Rome.  And behold\nhis history is written in the section for the sixth day of this (sic) month.  Salutation to\n‘Abulidis.\nAnd on this day also the holy father Abba ‘Ebelo, the shepherd, became [a martyr].  This\nsaint was shepherd of sheep, and he gave himself to Satan in his youth.   He used to\ncommit fornication, and steal, and commit murder, and there was no kind of sin which he\ndid not commit, for he committed them all, up to the age of forty years, and performed\nevery kind of work of Satan.  One day whilst he was sitting in the desert at mid-day, and\nwanting to cut the hair of his sheep, Satan cast a thought into his heart, and he said,\n“Behold, I have sinned from my youth up until now.  I have fulfilled everything, which\nSatan commanded me to do.  I have left no sin whatsoever in this world uncommitted. \nThere is, however, one sinful deed left me to do, for I want to rip open the belly of a\nwoman who is with child, so that I may see how the child lieth in her womb.”  And as he\nwas thinking this thought in his heart, behold a woman who was with child, and was very\nnear her time for bringing forth her child, was walking in the desert during the hot period\nof the day.  When he saw her he rose up straightway, and without mercy seized the hair of\nher head, and threw her on the ground, and took a knife and ripped up her belly, and saw\nhow the child was lying in her womb.  And after this the child died, and his mother died in\ngreat agony.  And when the shepherd saw the great sin which he had committed, he was\nexceedingly sorry, and he rent his garments forthwith and cast dust upon his head, and he\ncried out and wept bitterly and said, “Woe to me, for I have committed the great and\nunforgivable sin.”  And straightway he left his flocks scattered about, and he took a rod in\nhis hand, and he walked about, weeping bitterly, until he came to the desert of  Scete.  And\nhe did not mingle with the elder monks, and he did not tell them what he had done, but he\nwent into the Inner Desert, a very long way from them, a distance of ten stadia.  He had no\nbread with him to eat, and he had no abode wherein to dwell, but he ate with the beasts\nand he drank with them.  And he used to cry out by night and by day unceasingly, saying,\n“I have sinned, I am a sinner, I have done evil.   Forgive me, Thou art God, the good\nFather, for there is no man without sin; and God is not without mercy.”  And he continued\nto fight in this way for forty years, and his body became dried up and black through the\ndew of heaven, and the heat of the summer.  And when he entered upon the fortieth year of\nhis abode in the desert, he heard a voice, saying, “Be strong and of good courage, for\nbehold thy sin is forgiven thee, and the murder of the woman is forgiven thee; but the\nmurder of the child is not forgiven thee up to this present.”  And God in His mercy said\nunto him so that he might not become apathetic, and might not fall into sin a second time. \nAnd having heard these words he increased his bitter weeping, and his fighting until that\nyear was ended.  And towards the end of the fortieth year, when only three days remained\nfrom its end, the angel of God appeared unto a desert monk who lived far from him, in the\ndesert, a distance of twelve stadia, and who had dwelt there in the desert for seventy years\nwithout seeing a man.  And the angel of God said unto him, “Get thee outside thy desert,\nand thou shalt find an old man, and when he hath confessed to thee everything which he\nhath done, comfort him, and say unto him, ‘Behold, all thy sin is forgiven thee, and also\nthe murder of the child; thy sin is forgiven thee.’”   And the desert monk rose up and\ndeparted, and he went to the old man and talked to him, and they embraced each other, and\nAbba ‘Ebelo wept unceasingly.  And the desert monk said unto him, “Tell me what thou\nhast done, and why thou didst come hither”; and he told him everything, which had\nhappened to him, and how he had ripped up the belly of the woman.  And the desert monk\nsaid unto him, “Fear not, for thy sin is remitted to thee.”  And the desert monk said unto\nhim, “Whence dost thou receive the Offering?”  And the shepherd said unto him, “O my\nholy father, as God liveth, during the whole of the forty years which I have been living in\nthis desert I have seen no man save thyself.”  And the desert monk said unto him, “O my\nbeloved father, rejoice, for tomorrow the angel of God shall come unto thee, and shall\nadminister the Offering unto thee, at dawn.”  And when the morning of the day preceding\nthe Sabbath had come there arose the smell of a perfume which was exceedingly sweet,\nthe like whereof had never been smelt before, and Abba ‘Ebelo said unto the desert monk,\n“O my father, my soul craveth to depart through fear.”  And when he had said this, he saw\nthe angel of God standing by him in the form of a monk, and his face was shining very\n\nbrightly, and he sang a psalm, saying, “I was afflicted and God delivered me.  Return, my\nsoul, to thy rest; God hath helped thee.  For he hath delivered my soul from death, and\nmine eyes from tears, and my feet from slipping, as God was well-pleased in the country\nof the living” (Psalm cxvi, 6 ff.).  When Abba ‘Ebelo the shepherd heard this, he fell down\nupon the ground, and was as one dead through fear.   Then the angel, in the form of a\nmonk, put forth his hand, and lifted him up, and the shepherd saw that the angel in the\nform of a man was strong of heart, and he received the Holy and Divine Mysteries which\nhad come down from heaven from the hand of the shining angel, with great reverence, and\nwith fear and trembling.  And the angel of God ascended into heaven.  And when Abba\n‘Ebelo had received the Offering from the hand of the angel, his body became white like\nsnow, and he and the desert monk rejoiced, and glorified God until the evening.  And the\nshepherd Abba Ebeloy did not cease to pray as of old, saying, “I have sinned seventy times\nseven; I have done evil, forgive me, for Thou art God, and the Good Father; there is no\nman without sin, and God is not without mercy.”  And they passed that day, which was the\nFirst Day of the week, in glorifying God, and they did so until night, and then an\nexceeding sweet smell of a fragrant perfume made itself apparent, and it was stronger than\nbefore.  And the desert monk said unto Abba ‘Ebelo, “O my brother, wash in a little water,\nfor this is the hour wherein thou wilt receive for my sake [the reward of thy] toil.  Rejoice,\nmy brother, for thou shalt rest now”; and straightway the angel of God administered unto\nthem the Holy Mysteries; and Abba ‘Ebelo the shepherd died forthwith.  And the angels\ntook up his soul and flew up with it into the heights, and the desert monk wept for him,\nsaying, “What shall I do?   I am an old man, and I cannot carry thy body, and I have\nnothing wherewith to dig [a grave for thee].”   And straightway two lions came and\ncrouched by the body of Abba ‘Ebelo, and they made signs with their heads to the desert\nmonk, as much as to say unto him, “What shall we do?”  And he made a sign to them, and\nthey dug a grave for him, and they carried Abba ‘Ebelo to it, and buried him as men would\nhave done; and the desert monk was sorry, and he said, “Father, let me find someone to\nbury my body!”  And a voice came unto him saying, “I will bury thy body.  There are left\nonly three days before thou shalt have peace.  Behold, I will send unto thee three men; tell\nthem all the story of the fight of Abba ‘Ebelo, the shepherd, so that they may tell it unto\nothers, that those who have fallen into sin must not despair of the mercy of God.”  And on\nthe following day three  men came unto him, and he told them the history of the fight of\nAbba ‘Ebelo, the shepherd, and they marveled exceedingly, and they wrote down\neverything and they remained with him until the third day.   And then the desert monk\nprayed and delivered his soul into the hand of God.  And the two lions came and dug a\ngrave for him near that of Abba ‘Ebelo, and they buried him as if they had been man, and\nthen departed.  And the three men followed them until they brought them to the monastery\nof Abba Macarius, of the desert of Scete; and they told the monks everything, which had\nhappened.  And the monks marveled exceedingly and they wrote down the story of the\nfight of Abba ‘Ebelo, the shepherd, and they used to read it aloud each Sunday; now his\ndeath took place on the fifth day of Yakatit.   Salutation to Abba Ebeloy, whom Satan\ntripped up.  Salutation to Abba ‘Ebelo, the teacher of the Law.\nAnd on this day also took place the deaths of Banwa, and Bula, and ‘Amoni and ‘Esia, the\nfather and mother of Abba ‘Ebelo.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and\nthis story was noised abroad in all the city of Rome and the district round about it.  And\nthe emperor sought to burn the body in the fire, but the man with whom it was hid did not\nreveal it.  And this saint composed many homilies, some on the True Faith of our Lord\nJesus Christ, and some on the Incarnation of the Son of God in the nature of man, and\nsome of them dealt with Doctrine (or Dogma), and some contained Admonitions to do the\ngood pleasure of God.  And he drew up eight and thirty Canons on the Law of the Church,\nand these are to be found in our own churches, and in all the churches of all Christian\npeoples.  Salutation to the bringing up of the body of Abba Abulidis from out of the sea.\nAnd on this day also became martyrs the following saints:  ‘Abukir, and John, and three\nvirgins, and their mother, whose names were Theodora, which is, being interpreted, “Gift\nof God,” and Theophana, which is being interpreted, “Faith of God,” and Theodosia,\nwhich is, being interpreted, “Praise of God,” and Athanasia, which is, being interpreted,\n“Life which dieth not.”  And Saint ‘Abukir was a monk, and he was devoted to God, and\nwas a fighter from his youth up, and John was a soldier in the Imperial Army, and they\nwere men of the city of Alexandria.   And then they dwelt in the city of Antioch and,\ntogether with their mother and the virgins who were with them, they confessed our Lord\nJesus Christ before the Emperor Diocletian, who asked them whence they came.  And they\nsaid unto him, “From the city of Alexandria,” and he commanded that they should be\ntaken thither.   And when they came to the city of Alexandria, and stood up before the\ngovernor, and confessed our Lord Jesus Christ, he tortured them severely; and when he\nwas tired of torturing them, he commanded the soldiers to cut off their heads with the\nsword.   And Saint Athanasia encouraged her virgin daughters, and she urged them to\nendure, and she told them that they were to become brides of Christ, the True Emperor,\nand martyrs for His Name’s sake.  And Saint ‘Abukir likewise explained [this] to them,\nand reminded them of the tribulation which fell upon the apostolic woman Thecla.  And\nthe soldiers brought the virgins to the swordsman, one after the other, and their mother,\nand they became martyrs; and afterwards ‘Abukir and John became martyrs.  Then the\nemperor commanded the soldiers to cast their bodies to the wild beasts of the desert, and\nto the fowl of the heavens, but there were certain believers there who took away their\nbodies secretly, and they swathed them and laid them in coffers until the days of\npersecution should be ended.  And at length a church was built for them, and the believers\nlaid their bodies in it, and very many signs and miracles took place through them.\nAnd on this day also died Mary, the sinner, who anointed our Lord with unguent.  This\nblessed woman was first of all a sinner, and she acquired all her possessions by\nfornication, and she used to decorate herself with divers dresses and ornaments in order to\n\nlead young men astray.  One day she put on her ornamental apparel according to her wont,\nand she anointed herself, and perfumed her body, and she looked at herself in a mirror and\nshe admired the ruddiness of her cheeks, and the beauty of her eyes for a very long time,\nthat is to say, for an hour, as she was seated.  And then a good thought came upon her, and\nshe remembered death, and the fleeting character of the world.  And she heard that our\nLord Jesus Christ accepted sinners, and that He would pardon her sins, and she took all her\nmoney, and bought an alabastron of scented unguent.  And she went to Him whilst He was\nsitting at meat in the house of Simon, and she prostrated herself at His feet, and she\nanointed Him with the unguent, and washed Him with her tears and dried Him with the\nhair of her head.  And when our Lord saw the greatness of her love, He remitted her sins to\nher, and commanded [the disciples] to make mention of her when they preached the\nGospel.  And from that time she ministered unto Him with the holy women.  Salutation to\nMary.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

now it was decorated, and upon it was a dress of beautiful silk.  And he\nsaid, “What is this?”  And the priest said unto him, “This is a picture of our Lady Mary, the\nmother of Christ.”  And the king’s son abused it, and spat in its face, and said, “If I live I\nwill destroy the Christians and blot them out”; and forthwith he reviled our Lord Christ. \nWhen the night came he saw a most terrifying and horrible vision, and in the morning he\ntold his father, saying, “Last night great tribulation and intense pain came upon me from\nthe Satans, and I saw a man sitting upon a great throne, and he was exceedingly horrible,\nand frightful, and terrifying, and his face shone brighter than the sun, and thousands of\nthousands [of angels] were going round about him carrying weapons of war, and I and\nthou were bound behind him.  And I asked them [saying], ‘What is this?’  And they said\nunto me, ‘This is Christ, the King of the Christians, Whom thou didst mock yesterday.’ \nAnd then one of those who were carrying weapons of war came to me, and pierced my\nside with his spear, and none took the spear out, and at length I died.”  When his father\nheard this he was exceedingly sorry, and straightway the young man fell ill, and his tongue\nbecame dumb, and he died that night; and after forty days his father died also, and another\nking was appointed in his stead.  And he afflicted the Christians greatly, and he seized\nAbba Alexander and tortured him until he asked the people for three thousand dinars of\ngold, and gave them to him.  And God blotted out that king quickly, and after him was\nappointed another king, who was worse then he.  And he seized the captain of the troops of\nthis father, and demanded from him three thousand dinars of gold as before.  And this\nfather said unto him, “Some I must beg for from the believers, and some I must borrow”;\nbut he would not accept these words from him.  And the saint said unto the king, “Wait\nuntil I can ask some other people”; and he waited for him.  And this father went up into\nUpper Egypt to beg.   And there was a certain desert monk, who was in charge of a\nmonastery, and he had with him two disciples, and the desert man commanded his\ndisciples to clear out a place in the monastery, and they found there five water jars filled\nwith gold; and the disciples stole one jar and hid it, and they brought to the desert monk,\ntheir teacher, four water pots filled with gold, and the desert monk sent them to the\narchbishop to help him.  And when the two disciples of the desert monk [had carried] them\nto the archbishop, they took the water-pot of gold which they had stolen, and went into the\nworld, and they cast aside their monks’ garb, and they acquired with that gold menservants\nand maidservants, and cattle.  And the governor of that city commanded the soldiers to\nbeat them, and the two disciples confessed that they had found five water-pots full of gold;\nand the governor sent the captain of his soldiers to the king and he reported this matter to\nhim.   And the king sent the captain of his troops, and he plundered the house of the\narchbishop, and carried off all the sacred vessels and furniture of the churches.  And then\nhe had this father brought, and he bound him with fetters and put him in prison, and\ntreated him with contumely, and said unto him, “Bring me the four water-pots which were\nfull of gold [and contained] thirty hundred dinars.”  And the archbishop said unto him, “I\nhave no possessions whatsoever of this fleeting world,” but the king would not release him\nfrom prison until the archbishop had sent to all the people, and they had brought to him\n\nthirty hundred gold dinars and given them to him.  And then God blotted out this wicked\nking, and another king worse then he was appointed in his place, and he compelled all the\nChristian people to brand on their hands, instead of the honorable Cross, the name of the\nunclean and lying prophet, [Muhammad,] that is the mark of the beast, concerning which\nJohn the Evangelist and Theologian prophesied (Revelation xvi, 2).  And that wicked king\nsent to all the cities, and commanded the people to do this, and he commanded the\narchbishop to do this.   And the archbishop entreated him with many petitions to have\nmercy upon him, but he refused; and the archbishop asked him to wait for three days.  And\nthe archbishop prayed to God fervently, and with many entreaties, not to cast him away\nfrom Him, and not to let him come into this unclean affair; and God heard his prayer, and\nvisited him with a slight illness.  And the archbishop asked the king to allow him to go to\nhis house in the city of Alexandria, but he refused him, and he thought that he was making\nan excuse to avoid the branding of the hand.   And after three days the angel of God\nappeared unto the archbishop, and said unto him, “On the second day (i.e. to-morrow) thou\nshalt die.”   And the archbishop said unto his disciples, “Prepare a ship for me, for\ntomorrow God will visit me”; and he died in peace.  And they carried his body in a ship,\nand buried it with the bodies of the fathers, archbishops.  In the days of this father the\nMelchites of the country of Egypt had a holy archbishop whose name was Anastasius, and\nhis people rose up against him, and acted hostilely towards him, because of his love for the\nbelieving Jacobites.  And he meditated on the matter and betook himself to safety, and he\nwould not associate with his own people in their enmity against the Jacobite believers. \nAnd he forsook his people and came to this father Alexander, and he submitted to his\nauthority.   And this father honored him greatly, and asked him to occupy an episcopal\nthrone, and rule over the believers of his flock, and to let him dwell in a monastery like a\nmonk.  And Abba Anastasius was not pleased with these words, and he said unto him, “If I\nhad wanted the archiepiscopate, behold I am already archbishop, but I want to become thy\ndisciple.”  And after many entreaties, and much argument, which took place between them,\nAnastasius was pleased to become a bishop; and this father made him bishop over a\ncertain district in Egypt, and he shepherded well the flock over which he was placed.  And\nas for Abba Alexander he sat upon the throne of Mark the Evangelist for four and twenty\nyears and a half, and he pleased God and died in peace.  Salutation to Abba Alexander.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father, Abba Theodore, the forty-fifth Archbishop of the\ncity of Alexandria.  This saint was a monk in the monastery of the city of Mareotis, now\nthe name of the city (monastery?) was Tanbura, and he was the disciple of a certain\nrighteous and perfect elder, who saw by the Holy Spirit that his disciple Theodore would\nbe appointed Archbishop of the city of Alexandria, and he told the people this.  And this\nfather was strictly devoted to God, and he fought a great spiritual fight.  He was a man of\ngoodly appearance, and he wore sackcloth made of hair next to his skin, and over that\ngarments made of iron; and he was perfect in his humility, and in his meekness.  By the\nWill of God, Who chose him, he was made Archbishop of the city of Alexandria, and he\nprotected the flock of Christ with a good protection, and he taught them continually, and\nread to them the Scriptures daily, and especially on Sundays and on the festivals.  And in\nall his days there was tranquility and peace, and the Church flourished, and there was no\ncontention.  This father sat on the throne of Saint Mark the Evangelist for fourteen years\nand a half, and he fulfilled the duties of his office, and died in peace.  Salutation to Abba\nTheodore.\nSalutation to the desert monk who during a period of seventy years never saw the face of a\nman, and who comforted Abba Ebeloy.\nAnd on this day also took place the deaths of Abraken, and Abadir, and Abarianus, and\nNebdalms (Nebeldamas).\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

And then he said unto His mother Mary, “This thy Son is set for the falling\nand the rising of many of the children of Israel,” that is to say, “For the falling of those\nwho do not believe in Him, and for the rising of those who do believe in Him.”  And then\nhe made known unto her that suffering and separation would enter her heart at the time of\nHis Passion, and he said, “The spear of separation which shall be in thy heart shall pass\nthrough it.”  And when he had finished what the Law had commanded him, he died in\npeace.   And Hannah the prophetess, the daughter of Penuel, whom the Holy Gospel\nmentioneth, also prophesied concerning Him, and she praised God, and told the orthodox\namong the children of Israel that He was the Savior Who should deliver them from the\nworks of Satan, and from the fetters of Sheol.  Salutation to Thy coming to Jerusalem and\nThy reception by Simeon, and to Hannah.  Salutation to Simeon who embraced our Lord\nand kissed His hand.\n\nAnd on this day also died Hannah the prophetess, the daughter of Penuel.  This woman\nwas of the tribe of Asher, and her days [for bearing] were passed, and she had lived with\nher husband for seven years, and had been a virgin for four and eighty winters; and she\nnever left the temple, and she fasted and prayed all day and all night.  And when they\nbrought the Lord Jesus into the sanctuary forty days after He was born, she stood up\nbefore Him, and gave thanks to God, and she spoke about Him to all those who waited for\nthe salvation of Jerusalem; and then she died at a good old age.  Salutation to Hannah.\nAnd on this day also died the lady ‘Ammata Krestos, and her two handmaidens.  This holy\nwoman was of the people of the city of Constantinople, and she had a husband, who was\nin the Imperial Government, and he died in the days of his early manhood, and left her a\nwidow, when her days were twelve years.  And after a few days a certain man, who was\none of the emperor’s nobles, wanted to take her by force, and she made an excuse to him,\nsaying, “I am sick with a severe sickness, wait for me until I recover.”   And then she\ndistributed all her money among the poor and needy, and set free her slaves, and taking\ntwo of her handmaidens with her, she went forth by night, without knowing [whither to\ngo].  And she went into a rock, which was under a high hill, and dwelt there for twelve\nyears, and each day the birds brought regularly to her various kinds of fruits.  And in the\ndays of the Emperor Constantine one of the historians saith, “I went towards the East in\norder that I might bring a certain piece of work to an end, and I arrived at a monastery, and\nthe abbot and the monks received me, and I saluted them, and we sat down.  And there\nwere there all kinds of trees full of fruit, and I saw birds carrying off branches with their\nfruit on them, and they flew away with them quickly, and did not eat thereof; and having\nseen this I marveled, and I said unto the monks, ‘What is this thing?’  And they said unto\nme, ‘They have been doing this for eleven years, and we know not what becometh [of the\nfruit].’  And I said unto them, ‘It seemeth to me that the birds carry this fruit to the monks\nwho are in the mountains.’  And as I was saying this a raven came, and taking a branch\ncovered with fruit flew away.  And I followed it, together with the abbot and the monks, so\nthat we might know what the raven did with the fruit, and when the bird alighted in a\nravine it dropped the branch and returned.  And when we came to this place we threw a\nstone, and we heard a voice, saying, ‘If ye be Christians do not kill us.’  And we said unto\nthem, ‘Who are ye?’  And they said unto us, ‘If ye wish to see our faces throw us down\nthree garments, for we are naked.’  And we threw down garments to them, and we went\ndown to them by means of a very narrow mountain path, and when we came there three\nwomen received us, and they bowed to us, and we bowed to them.  And one of them sat\ndown, and the other stood up before her.  And the abbot said unto her, ‘Whence art thou, O\nmy mother, my lady, and how dost thou come to be here?’  And she told him all her story,\nfrom the beginning even unto the end thereof.   And the abbot said unto her, ‘If thou\nwishest we will fetch food from the monastery, and we will partake of it with thee.’  And\nshe said unto him, ‘O my father, command [thy servants] to bring hither a priest with the\nOffering, so that we may partake of the Holy Mysteries of Christ the Vivifier; but since\nthou wilt have gone forth thou wilt not partake of the Offering with us.’  And the abbot\ncommanded his servants to bring a priest with the Offering, and she and her handmaidens\npartook of the Holy Mysteries.  And on the following day she prayed and delivered up her\nsoul into the hand of God, and her handmaidens died with her, one after the other.  And the\nmonks wrapped them in cloths and buried them with psalms and hymns.”  Salutation to the\nthree women who bore the hardships of the desert naked.\nAnd on this day also died Abba Elias of the desert of Scete, the great elder whose works\nwere most excellent.  When the righteous Emperor Theodosius sent to the desert of Scete a\nletter asking the monks to send to him an elder monk of excellent works so that he might\ncomfort him with his words, they sent this holy man, and they wrote a letter by the hand of\nanother monk, saying, “Behold we have sent unto thee a holy man who is called ‘Elias,’\nthe counterpart of Elias, the prophet,”  And when Elias arrived, the Emperor Theodosius\nsaid unto the elder, “The monks have sent to me a letter saying that thy spiritual strife\nresembleth that of Elias the prophet.”  And the elder said unto him with humility and\nmeekness, “O righteous Emperor, forgive me.  Every man is known by his ability (or,\nnatural disposition).  And as for the strife of Elias, because of his righteousness a raven\nused to bring him his food, whereas so far as I am concerned, I have all the food which I\n\nrequire.  If I laid my bread out in the sun, a raven would come and carry it off.”  When the\nemperor heard this he marveled at the savor of his words, and he said unto him, “Tell me,\nO my father, why God did not give unto thee a son?”  And the elder said, “Because the\ndays will come when there shall arise on the earth division in respect of the Faith.  For this\nreason, God hath not given unto me a son, so that he might never mingle with those who\ndoubt (or the ‘dividers’).”  And the emperor wished to give him money, but he would not\ntake it, and he turned back to his abode, and it is said of him, that he did not eat food until\nhe returned to his cell; and he died in peace.  Salutation to Elias [of Scete].\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and he\nmade him to know what would happen to him.  And having been born Barsoma grew up in\nthe knowledge of God, and he fled from his parents, and came to the River Euphrates; and\nthere lived there a certain righteous man, whose name was Abraham, and he took him into\nthe monastery through fear of his father.  And Saint Abba Barsoma dwelt in a rock, and he\nfought a great fight there, and his fame was noised abroad everywhere, and he had many\ndisciples.  Now the water of the place where he lived was exceedingly bitter, and when he\nhad prayed [over it] God changed it, and it became sweet.  And God performed great signs\nand wonders by his hands, and among them are the following:  Once he and his disciples\nwere a long way from their cells, and when the time of sunset drew nigh they were still far\naway from their cells.  And he asked our Lord Jesus Christ, and He made the sun to stand\nstill until the saint arrived in his cell.  And again there was a city, the name of which was\nRa’am, whereof the people were infidels, and by the Will of God the rain was withheld,\nand no rain fell on them.  And being in tribulation they came to Saint Barsoma, and he\nadmonished them, and he made an agreement with them that if they would believe in God,\nhe would make an abundant rain to fall upon them; and they said unto him, “Yea, we\nwill.”  And he asked our Lord Christ, and He rained on them, and they believed on God. \nAnd there was also another city, the people whereof were infidels, and he converted them\nall to the knowledge of God, and he destroyed many houses of idols.  And this saint made\nfor himself an abode, wherein he stood upright and never sat down for four and fifty years,\nand when he was tired of keeping vigil and toil he slumbered standing up, with a brass\nvessel under his hand on which to lean; and he fasted seven days at a time.  And this saint\nlived in the days of Abba Simeon of the Pillar, and he wished to see him greatly, for he had\nheard the report of his holiness and virtues from many men.  And this holy man came to\nAbba Simeon, and each was blessed by the other, and then he returned to his monastery. \nAnd he preached in the city of Samaria, and when he wrought before the people many\nsigns and wonders, they believed.   And he went to the Emperor Theodosius, and\nstrengthened him in the True Faith, and the emperor gave him much money, but he would\naccept nothing whatsoever from him.  And the emperor wrote an order that the saint was to\nhave dominion over all the bishops in the country of Antioch, and he gave him the ring\nfrom his fingers.  And when the General Council of Two Hundred Bishops assembled in\nthe city of Ephesus, on account of Nestorius, the “denier,” and they anathematized him,\nand cursed him, and cut him off [from his office], this father was with them.  And the\nemperor wrote to him with his own hand, commanding that all the officials who were\nappointed in the country of Antioch were to be in submission to him; and Barsoma wrote\nletters to all the cities, and sealed them with the imperial seal, and commanded them to do\ngood works, and to hate evil men.  And certain men calumniated him to the emperor, and\nsaid unto him, “Behold, Abba Barsoma eateth well, and drinketh well, and weareth fine\napparel”; and the emperor sent one of his messengers to find out if what was reported of\nAbba Barsoma was true.  And when the emperor’s friend came to the saint, he did not find\nthat even the smallest particular of the evil things which they had spoken about him was\ntrue.  And then he brought him before the emperor, who did not find that he had changed\nany of his spiritual qualities, of which he had knowledge, and the emperor paid him great\nhonor, and he returned to his monastery.  And when the Emperor Marcianus, the infidel,\nassembled the Council of Chalcedon, the councilors of the emperor asked him to allow\n\nthem to bring Barsoma to them, now they did not know that the grace of the Holy Spirit\nwas upon him, and that he might neither dispute with them, nor overcome them in\nargument, nor put them to shame.  And when the unclean General Council, wherein they\nseparated Christ, and assigned to Him Two Natures, was ended, the blessed Barsoma\nargued against them, and made their words of no effect, and he anathematized them and\nexcommunicated them.  And they wrote to the emperor and calumniated Barsoma, and he\nmade him come, but he was not able to resist the grace of the Holy Spirit which was upon\nhim.   And then Abba Barsoma cursed the empress, and she departed; but she only\nremained alive for a few days, and she died an evil death.  And the heretics opposed him,\nand they wrote to all the cities, urging the people not to submit to him; but they did not\nlisten to them, and did not abandon the command and doctrine (or, teaching) of the saint. \nAnd three hundred heretics banded themselves together, having with them the heretical\nbishops, and they lay in wait on the road to kill him; and then they sent a message to him\ntelling him to come to them, so that they might go to the church together.  And when he\nhad come, and was journeying along the road with them, they cast stones at him, and their\nstones flew back on their own heads; and they fled and departed from him, being\nashamed.  And then God, wishing to take him out of the bondage of this world, sent unto\nhim an angel who said, “After two days thou shalt depart from this world.”  And Saint\nAbba Barsoma sent his disciple to the cities which were round about him, and he\ncomforted the believers; and as the disciple was going about he came to a place wherein\nwas the head of Saint John the Baptist, and he saluted his holy head.  And he wept, and he\nasked it about the Emperor Marcianus, and a voice came forth from the head of Saint John\nthe Baptist, saying, “Fear not, for he is dead; Barsoma complained of him to God.”  And\nSaint Abba Barsoma blessed his disciple, and he died in peace.   And a pillar of light\nappeared by the gates of his cell, and [it reached] to heaven, and all the believers saw it\nfrom afar off, and they came to the saint, and they found that he was dead.  And they were\nblessed by him, and they wept over him, and sorrowed because of their separation from\ntheir spiritual father.  And they prepared him for burial in a manner befitting him, and with\nthe singing of many psalms and hymns they laid him in the grave.  Salutation to Barsoma,\nthe “son of fasting.”\nAnd on this day also Saint Paul the Syrian became a martyr.  The parents of this holy man\nwere Syrians, and they were merchants, and lived in the city of Alexandria, wherein they\nbegot this saint; and then they lived in the city of ‘Esmunain.  When he was grown up, his\nparents died and left him much money.  When he heard that the heretic emperors tortured\nthe believing saints who believed on the Name of Christ, and killed them, he gave all his\nmoney to the poor and needy, and then he prayed, and asked our Lord Christ to direct him\nin the path which would please Him.  And God sent to him Suriel, His angel, and he told\nhim about all the torture which should come upon him for the sake of the Name of Christ. \nAnd he said unto him, “Behold, God hath commanded me to be with thee, and to\nstrengthen thee; fear not.”  And he rose up and went to the city of Antinoe, and confessed\nour Lord Jesus Christ before the governor, who commanded the soldiers to strip him naked\nand to beat him with whips, and they did so; then they thrust burning torches into his sides,\nbut the fire did not touch him.  And the king offered to him much money, so that he might\ndeny Christ.  And the blessed Paul said unto him, “When my parents died they left me\nsixteen (or, seventeen) maklit of gold, but I reject them and would not take them, because\nof [my] love for Christ; how then can I accept thy money?”  And the governor commanded\nthem to make iron rods red-hot, and to thrust them into his ears, and mouth, and they did\nso; and God sent His angel Suriel to him, and he touched his body, and healed him.  And\nthey put upon his body venomous serpents, but they would not touch him.   And the\ngovernor commanded them to cut out his tongue, and they cut it out, and God healed him. \nAnd when the governor went to the city of Alexandria, he took Paul with him; and our\nLord Christ appeared to him in the ship and comforted him, and strengthened him.  And\nthe saint had a friend whose name was Abba ‘Esi, and Takla his sister, and our Lord Christ\ntold him that his body should be laid with their bodies, and his soul with their souls; now\nthese saints were in prison in the city of Alexandria.  And when Saint Paul had come unto\nthem, they embraced each other, and their souls rejoiced at seeing him.  And when the\ngovernor returned to the city of Antinoe, they cut off the head of Saint Paul and threw it on\n\nthe riverbank, and he received the crown of martyrdom.  And certain believing men took\nhis body, and wrapped it up in costly cloths, and hid it in their houses; and many signs and\nwonders and many healings took place through it.  Salutation to Paul.  Salutation to the\ntranslation of thy body.\nAnd on this day is celebrated the commemoration of Peter the martyr.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and that before the world was He was with the Father;\nand that He is His Word, for He saith, “In our own image and likeness”; and that He\ndwelleth in heaven, above the Cherubim and Seraphim, who praise [God]; and that it is He\nWho existeth at His great right hand in heaven, and that it was He Who was carried in the\nwomb of Mary the Virgin, and that He was God, Who became man.  This was the word of\nthe apostle among those crowds, and he was unafraid.  One man became a witness of the\nbirth of the Son of God, Who was One in His Death, and in His Resurrection, and in His\nAscension into heaven.  And thus he taught all the multitudes the Faith of Christ.  And\nwhen the multitude heard the word of the apostle, they became very angry with the anger,\nwhich was of their father Satan, who was with them, and they were wroth with the apostle\nof our Lord Jesus Christ.  And they all banded together against him, and the Jews seized\nhim, and put his blood on their own heads, and they took him and brought him to the\nEmperor Gelawdios, the deputy of the Emperor of Rome.   And they calumniated this\ndisciple to him, and they told him, saying, “This man hath preached to us of another king\nbesides Caesar.”  And when the emperor heard this he commanded the soldiers to stone the\nApostle James, and they all made haste and stoned him and he died in peace, and received\nthe crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  And certain believing men took\nhis body, and prepared it for burial, and they buried it by the sanctuary.   Salutation to\nJames the Apostle and martyr of Christ.\nAnd on this day also Saint Justus became a martyr.  This saint was the son of Nomarius\n(Numerianus), the Emperor of Rome.  And having gone to the war, and having married the\nsister of Diocletian, the infidel, his wife made him king; and when Justus returned from\nthe war, and found that Diocletian had denied Christ, he sorrowed with a very great sorrow\nbecause of it.  And when the men of the city saw this, they all gathered together to him,\nand they said unto him, “We will kill Diocletian and thou shalt sit upon the throne of the\nkingdom.”  But he did not wish this, and he persuaded them not to kill Diocletian for he\nhad chosen a heavenly rather than an earthly kingdom.  And he drew nigh to the emperor,\nand confessed our Lord Christ before him; and the emperor said unto him, “My lord\nJustus, who hath forced thee to do this against thy wish?”  Now the emperor was very\nmuch afraid of Justus.  And Saint Justus said unto him, “As my Lord Jesus Christ liveth if\nthou dost not write the decree for my fight, so that I may finish my martyrdom, I will make\nthe people of this city to rise up against thee, and expel thee from thy kingdom.”  And\nDiocletian was afraid of him, and commanded the soldiers to take him to the country of\nEgypt, together with Theocleia his wife, and Aboli his son.  And thus he sent them to the\ncountry of Egypt.  And he commanded the governor of the city of Alexandria to persuade\nhim quietly, and not to cause him vexation of heart, for, he said, peradventure his heart will\nturn, and he will be submissive to the emperor; and if his heart doth not turn, separate him\nnot from his wife and his son.  And when Justus arrived in the land of Egypt (now he had\nwith him some of his servants, and the emperor’s letter), as soon as the governor of the\ncity of Alexandria saw him, he was greatly afraid of him.  And he began to persuade him,\nand he said unto him, “My lord, do not this thing, and do not disgrace thine honorable\nposition”; and Saint Justus said unto him, “Do not multiply words.”  And the governor was\nafraid, and sent him to Upper Egypt, to the city of Antinoe, and his son ‘Aboli to the city\nof Basta, and Theocleia his wife to the city of Sa, and he gave to each of them one of their\n\nservants to remain with them until they finished their martyrdoms, and to care for their\nbodies.  And Saint Justus finished his fight nobly, and they cut off his head with the sword\nin the city of Antinoe, and he received an incorruptible and everlasting crown in the\nkingdom of the heavens.  And many signs and miracles, and many healings, took place\nthrough his body.  Salutation to Justus.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father, the man devoted to God, the learned one, the\nfighter, the teacher of all the ends of the world, Abba Isidore from the city of Farma.  The\nparents of this saint were rich and noble people and they belonged to the honorable folk of\nMesr (Cairo), and were kinsfolk of our holy fathers and archbishops Abba Theophilus and\nAbba Cyril of the city of Alexandria.  And this saint was the only child of his parents, and\nthey taught him spiritual and material doctrine, and they taught him all the Books of the\nChurch, and he kept them with him and learned them by heart.  And he also learned the\nphilosophy of the Greeks, and the knowledge of the stars of the heavens; and of what\ngoeth round all the ends of the world, and he excelled many in his knowledge and in\nphilosophy; and he was devoted to God, and was a fighter, and vigilant, and lowly.  And\nwhen he heard that the men of the cities had agreed together, and had taken counsel with\nthe bishops to take him and to make him Archbishop of the city of Alexandria, he fled by\nnight and came to the city of Farma, and became a monk there. Thence he departed to a\nsmall cell, and lived there alone for many years.  And he composed many Homilies and\nAdmonitions, some of which are addressed to kings and governors; and he translated many\nbooks, [and] Books of the Church, and the Old and the New Testaments.  Now the number\nof the Books, and the Homilies, and the Admonitions, and the Questions which other\npeople asked him, and the Epistles which he composed, and dispatched to the bishops and\narchbishops of many dioceses is known; and the number is ten thousand, and the Epistles\nand Homilies and Admonitions are eighty hundred.  Now the Holy Spirit used to well up\nin his heart, and flow forth even as do the rivers.  And having finished this good work, and\nfollowed a good course of life with great spiritual fighting, he arrived at a good old age;\nand he pleased God and died in peace.  Salutation to Isidore.\nAnd on this day also Saint Felos, Bishop of the country of Fars (Persia), became a martyr. \nWhen the bishop would not sacrifice to the fire, and would not worship the sun, the King\nof Persia tortured him; and when he was tired of torturing him he cut off his head with a\nsword, and he received the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  Salutation\nto Felos, the bishop, whom the King of Persia killed with a hatchet.\nAnd on this day also is celebrated the commemoration of Nicolaus, and Simon, and\nSadalakos.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

This infidel stirred up great trials and many tribulations for the believers,\nand he martyred very many people.  And the Seven Children, who are known to have slept\nin a cave for many years, fled from him.  He built in the city of Ephesus a great temple\nwherein he established idols, and he killed all those who would not worship them.  And\nwhen he heard that this saint was opposed to them, and that he taught the believers to obey\nhim he sent to the city of Rome, and had him brought to Ephesus, and asked him to\nworship idols; and the saint would not obey him, but laughed at him and his idols, and\ncursed them.  And the governor was angry with him, and tortured him severely, for the\nspace of one year, and when he was tired of torturing him he cut off his head with a sword,\nand the saint received a crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  Salutation to\nBelanteyanos.\nAnd on this day also died Abba Eulog (Eulogius), the writer and companion of lions.  The\nparents of this saint were from the city of Gasbin (Nisibis), and they were rich in gold and\nin silver, and they taught their son all the Ordinances of the Church; after a few [days] they\ndied, and left him much money.  One day Abba ‘Eulog (Eulogius) remembered the word\nof the Gospel which saith, “Sell all thy goods and give [the price thereof] to the poor and\nneedy, and take up My Cross, and come, follow Me” (Matthew xvi, 24).  And straightway\nhe gave away all his goods to the poor, and departed to the monastery of Awgin; and when\n‘Awgin saw him, he received him with joy, for before ‘Eulog (Eulogius) came to him he\nsaw a vision in which one said unto him, “Behold a young man of goodly appearance will\ncome unto thee, receive him, and let him mix with the brethren who minister unto thee”;\nand ‘Awgin continued to counsel him for the space of three years.   When he saw his\nholiness, and his perfection, he arrayed him in the garb of the monk, which is the dress of\nthe angels.  And ‘Eulog (Eulogius) toiled hard in the ascetic life, and he fasted from one\nSabbath to the next, and his food was bread and salt.  And he used to pray six (or, seven)\nhundred prayers by day and night, and did not sleep, and he continued to fight this fight\nfor thirty years, and then he entreated his teacher [to be allowed to go into the desert].  And\nhe departed to the desert, and went into a little cell, wherein he fought the fight for fifty\nyears; and God gave him two lions, which ministered unto all his wants.  And then he\nbecame sick with a grievous sickness, and he said unto the lions, “I want to drink some hot\nwater.”   And the lions went into the mountain, and they found a shepherd who was\nwatching his flocks, and [one of the lions] took this shepherd up and brought him to the\ndoor of the cell of the holy man.  And when the shepherd saw him, he bowed low before\nhim, and said unto him, “What dost thou want, O my father?”  And ‘Eulog (Eulogius) said\nunto him, “Give me some hot water to drink”; and the shepherd supplied his want, and\nthen Abba ‘Eulog (Eulogius) commanded the lion to take the shepherd back to his\ndwelling.  And when the shepherd arrived he told all the people about it, saying, “I found a\nrighteous man, for the sole of whose foot the world is not [large enough?].’  And when\nthey heard the report of him, all the people gathered together to him, and they brought to\nhim all those who were sick, and he healed them.  And in those days his teacher Abba\n‘Awgin wished to go to the country of Fars (Persia), and to convert those who worshipped\nidols to the True Faith, and he wished to take with him his son Abba ‘Eulog (Eulogius),\n\nbut before he sent him a message to this effect, the Holy Spirit made the lion to\nunderstand, and the lion carried the cloak and the Gospel of the holy man, and made him\nsigns concerning the road, and the saint followed him, and arrived at the place where Mar\n‘Awgin was; and when ‘Awgin saw him, he received him with gladness.  And as they were\ntraveling along the road they came to the River Tigris, and the waters thereof were divided\nfor them, and they passed over.  And when they arrived in the city, they converted the\nworshippers of idols to the True Faith, and baptized them in the Name of the Father and of\nthe Son and of the Holy Ghost.  One day when the holy men were hungry Mar ‘Eulog\n(Eulogius) commanded the lions to seek some food for them, and when the lions had set\nout they found al old man carrying a load of bread on a donkey, on which was a child; and\nthe lions took this donkey and brought him to the holy men.  Now the child died of fright,\nbut when Abba ‘Eulog (Eulogius) had prayed, he restored him to life.   And then he\nreturned to his cell, and fell sick a little, and he died and was buried with great honor.  And\nthe lions continued to watch by his grave for twelve years, and then they returned to the\ndesert.  Salutation to ‘Eulog (Eulogius), the companion of lions.\nAnd on this day also is celebrated the commemoration of Abraham the bishop, and Kanti,\nand Abba Makabis (Maccabaeus) the monk.\nAnd on this day also died Abba Patra (Batra), the disciple of Abba Sylvanus.  This saint\nused to live in a cell of Dabra Sina keeping the precepts of the doctrine, and at the time of\nsupper he used to give to his body what it needed.  And when they made him Bishop of\nFarnu he exhausted himself greatly by excessive abstinence, and his disciples said unto\nhim, “O our father, if thou wast in the desert thou couldst not use such excessive\nabstinence.”  And he said unto them, “When I was in the desert, in poverty, [and living\nupon] fragments, I ordered myself so that my body was never sick; but now that I am in a\ncommunity I have many wants, and it is best for me to reduce my body and keep it in\nsubjection.”  And he continued to fight the fight strenuously, and then he died.  Salutation\nto Abba Patra.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

One day certain men brought a fish to the monastery, and the cook boiled it and\nput it in his cell, and having set a boy to watch it he went about his business; and the boy\nate the greater part of he fish.  And when the cook came back, and found that the boy had\neaten [the greater part] of the fish, he was wroth with him, and he said unto him, “Why did\nyou eat of the fish before the holy elder had blessed it?”  And after this, by the work of\nSatan, wrath came upon him, and he kicked him with his foot, and the boy fell down upon\nthe ground and died.  And when he saw that the boy was dead, he was greatly dismayed,\nand fear came upon him, and he went and told the elder Gelasius what had happened.  And\nthe saint said unto him, “Take him up, and lay him in the sanctuary”; and the man went\nand did as the elder had commanded.  And when the holy elder came into the church, they\nprayed the evening prayer, and when they had finished the prayer, the elder went forth\nfrom the sanctuary, and the boy was following him, and none of the monks knew what had\nhappened.  And the elder laid a penance on the cook, and commanded him to tell none of\nthe monks about this until after his death.  And Saint Abba Gelasius having finished all his\ngood work, and his excellent fight, the time for God to comfort him arrived; and he\ndeparted from this fleeting world, and left behind an excellent remembrance; and he\npleased God, and died in peace.  Salutation to Gelasius.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated Derkalas (Dereskal).\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

his father’s name was Theodore, and his mother’s name was Mary.  And\nwhen his days were twenty years, he determined in his heart to die for the Name of our\nLord Jesus Christ, and he came to Cyprianus the governor, and confessed our Lord Jesus\nChrist before him.   And the governor commanded the soldiers to inflict every kind of\ntorture upon him, and to shut him up in prison.  And our Lord Jesus Christ commanded the\nangels to carry away his soul into heaven, and he saw the habitations of the saints, and his\nsoul was comforted, and Christ healed him of his sufferings.  And a certain priest whose\nname was Abba Masun heard of his fight, and two deacons also, and they rose up and\ncame to the governor of the city of Athribis, and confessed our Lord Christ.   And the\ngovernor commanded the soldiers to beat them, and they did as he commanded them, and\nall the people were looking on at them, and they walked round about them, and they were\nsorry for the deacons and the priest.  And the priest rebuked them, and turned his face to\nthem, and he taught them, and commanded them, saying thus, “Be strong in the True Faith\nof our Lord Christ.”  And then he prayed over some water, and sprinkled it upon them. \nAnd the grace of the Holy Spirit descended upon them, and they confessed our Lord\nChrist; and the soldiers cut off the heads of all of them with the sword, and they received\nthe crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  The governor commanded the\nsoldiers to cast the priest into the furnace of the public baths, but God delivered him there\nfrom.  And the angel of God appeared unto him, and made him to know that he would be\nmartyred thrice for the sake of Christ, and then the angel of God brought him out of the\nfurnace.  And the governor sent him to the city of Alexandria, and he finished his fight\nthere, and received the crown of martyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.   And\nCyprianus, the governor, had Sergius brought before him, and he tortured him with severe\ntortures, and then they brought a wheel of brass, and they crushed him, and his members\nbecame two parts, and all his body was torn asunder; but our Lord Christ raised him up\nwhole and uninjured.  Then they brought unto him an idol for him to worship, and the\nsaint spurned it with his foot, and it fell down, and was broken in pieces.  When Cyprianus\nsaw this he believed in our Lord [Jesus] Christ.  And he said, “The god who could not save\nhimself, how can he save others?”   And Eucheius, the captain of the soldiers, tortured\nSaint Sergius very severely, and he told the soldiers to flay him, and to rub him with\nvinegar and salt mixed together; but Christ gave power to the saint, and he was strong. \nAnd when his mother and his sister heard [of this] they came to him, and when they saw\nhim they wept over him, and his sister delivered up her spirit through her excessive grief\nfor him.  And the saint prayed to God, and his sister rose up from the dead, and became\nalive straightway.  And Saint Julius, of the city of ‘Akpihas, the writer of martyrdoms,\ncame to him, and he enquired about his body, and would bury it.   And then Eucheius\ncommanded them to torture Saint Sergius on the wheel, and to thrust burning torches into\nhis ears, and to pluck out the nails of his hands and feet, and to suspend a huge stone from\nhis neck, and to lay him upon the iron bed and to light a fire beneath him; and they did\nthese things even as the captain commanded, but our Lord Jesus Christ strengthened him,\nand healed his wounds, and raised him up whole and uninjured.  And the captain of the\nsoldiers being weary of torturing him, he commanded them to cut off his head with the\nsword; and when the saint heard this he rejoiced exceedingly.  And he sent a message to\nhis father, and his mother, and his brethren, and all his kinsfolk and the men of his\nhousehold, and they came to see him and they found him with a gag in his mouth.  And the\nsoldiers were dragging him away to cut off the head of the saint and the heads of all those\nwho were with him; and they cut off their heads and the saints received the crown of\nmartyrdom in the kingdom of the heavens.  Now there was a little child among the people,\nand God opened his eyes, and he saw the souls of the holy martyrs, and the angels carrying\n\nthem up into heaven, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying, “My Lord Jesus Christ\nhave mercy upon me.”  And his parents were afraid lest the governor should hear him, and\ndestroy them because of him, and they shut his mouth, as he continued to cry out and to\ncall upon our Lord [Jesus] Christ, and then they laid stones upon him until he delivered up\nhis soul, and received the crown of life in the kingdom of the heavens.  And the angels\ntook his soul, and carried it up into heaven.  Salutation to Sergius, whose nails were cut\nout with knives.\nAnd on this day also died Eusebius the martyr, of splendid glory, and sweet perfume, the\nson of the judge (or, governor) of Syria; and he had a sister who was full of the spirit, and\nwhose name was Eulophia.  This saint was brought up carefully and wisely, and then they\nbetrothed him to a beautiful maiden, the daughter of the Emperor of Rome, and they\nbrought her to his house with great splendor.  And on that day he went to his sister, and\nsaid unto her, “Counsel me with counsel.  Is it better to take a wife, and to live with her [or\nno]?  I do not wish to do this, for I long to renounce the world.”  And she said unto him,\n“What will the taste of this fleeting world benefit thee?  It is better for thee to dwell in\nvirginity like Demetrius the Archbishop.”  And when the evening had come he went into\nthe bridal-chamber where was the bride, whom they had brought unto him, and he took her\nhead (or, neck) and kissed her, and said unto her, “Prithee, tell me if I may say unto thee a\nmatter.”  And she said unto him, “Speak, tell me.”  And he made an agreement with her,\nand he said unto her, “O my sister, know thou that the lust of the world passeth away, and\nthat comeliness and beauty fade, and that nothing whatsoever profiteth a man except the\nworking of righteousness.  And now, it is better for us to live as virgins, and not to defile\nthe temples of our bodies of flesh.”  And she said unto him, “I agree, O my brother, I do\nnot wish to marry.”   And the two of them began to travel together along the path of\nrighteousness, and they dwelt in purity for two years, and they ate no food until [after]\nthey had received the Offering, and they slept in the same bed, and each night they stood\nin the river, and by day they went into the church, the name whereof is ‘Atra, and each of\nthem made four thousand prostrations, and they read the Psalms of David and the Gospel\nof John continually.   One day the wife of the King of Syria saw Eusebius, and she\ncommanded two of her servants to bring him to her.  And when they had brought him,\nstraightway she laid down carpets and purple linen on her bed, and she adorned herself and\nput round her neck a gold collar, and she said unto Eusebius, “Come [and] sit down, and I\nwill tell thee what is in my heart.”  And Eusebius said unto her, “I will not sit down with\nthe wife of the king; tell me what thou hast to say as I stand up.”  And she said unto him,\n“My flesh quivereth, and my bones melt through the greatness of my love for thee; come\nand sit down with me.”  And Eusebius answered and said unto her, “I will not lie with\nthee.  It is not seemly, and the commandment of God is not thus.”  And when she wished\nto lay hold upon him, he went forth, and ran away, and came into the church.   And\nstraightway the woman called her servants and said unto them, “As soon as he looked at\nme with his eyes pain and suffering seized me; he is a magician”; and she commanded\nfourteen of the elders to make him come out of the church, and to bring him to her.  And\nwhen they had brought him to her she commanded them to beat him with two iron rods,\nand to bind him hand and foot and to hang him up on a tree; and they hung him up outside\nthe city, and she sent one of her handmaidens to say unto him, “Consent to do the will of\nmy mistress, that she may have thee taken down”; but he would not hearken unto the voice\nof the harlot.  And straightway he began to pray with the tears running down his face like\nwater in the winter, and he said, “O my Lord God, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,\nWho didst command the deliverance of Jacob, and Who didst deliver our fathers from\nevery trial, deliver Thou Thy servant Eusebius, O Thou Who didst deliver Daniel from the\nmouth of the lion, and Susannah from the hand of the Rabbis, deliver me from the hand of\nthe tyrant and oppressor, for besides Thee I have no other helper.”  And then the queen\ncommanded them to strangle him with a cord, and to shoot at him four hundred and sixty-\neight arrows; and when they had done this to him, God commanded the angels Michael\nand Gabriel, and they plucked out the arrows, from his limbs, and he became whole, and\nthere was no injury on him.  And when the king came back from his expedition he asked\nthe queen, saying, “What is the offense of Eusebius?  And what is his crime that thou hast\ndelivered him over to crucifixion and death?”  And his wife the queen said unto him, “I am\n\nashamed to tell thee, for I am afraid of thee”; and the king said, “Speak, tell me, and do not\nbe afraid of me.”  And she said unto him, “This man is a magician.  He came to me when I\nwas alone, and he asked me [to do] what is unseemly to mention, and when I refused him,\nhe smote me with pains.”  And the king commanded the soldiers to take Eusebius down\nfrom the tree and to bring him to him.  And when they had brought him, the king said unto\nEusebius, “Why didst thou meditate evilly the doing of a thing which it is not seemly to do\nagainst my wife?”  And Eusebius said unto the king, “O my lord, dost thou imagine that\nthese words are true?  It is unnecessary to talk about it.”  And the king questioned the\nservants and said unto them, “Is this what I hear true?”  And they said unto him, “O my\nlord the king, when we entered the royal chamber, we found the queen screaming.  And\nwhen we asked her, ‘What hath happened to thee?’ she told us thus.”  And when the king\nheard this he was filled with anger and fury, like a lion, and he commanded them to cut off\nthe head of Eusebius with the sword, and to cut off his limbs as they cut up an ox, and to\nthrow him into a cauldron, and to smother his mouth with pitch, and to boil him over the\nfire; [and they did so].  And straightway the archangels Michael and Gabriel came, and\nthey took his body out of the cauldron, and raised him up alive.  And after he had risen\nfrom the sleep of death, the people found him walking about in the city; and they told the\nking that he was alive, and he commanded them to bring him to him.   And straightway he\nput four iron bands round him, one round his neck (or, head), one round his body, one\nround his thighs, and one round his knees, and then they bound him hand and foot, and\ncast him into the fire.  And Michael and Gabriel came and cooled the fire, and Uriel the\nangel caught him up, and carried him into heaven, where he remained for two years; and\nthen he returned to earth and lived [here] for forty years preaching the Faith; and through\nhim eight thousand and fifty hundred pagans believed.  And God made a covenant with\nhim that He would forgive the sins of every one who called upon the name of the saint, or\nwho celebrated his commemoration.\nAnd on this day also died Philemon the musician.  This Philemon the musician used to\nsing and play to Arianus the governor, and amuse him.  And one day Arianus called Apollo\nthe reader and said unto him, “Sacrifice to the gods.”  And Apollo went to Philemon, and\nsaid unto him, “I will give thee four dinars if thou wilt sacrifice instead of me.”   And\nPhilemon said unto him, “Give me thy garments, and I will wrap my self up in them, and\ngo in instead of thee.”  And when he went in Arianus knew that he was Philemon, and he\nsaid unto him, “What hath happened unto thee?”  And he said unto him, “I am a Christian\nand I believe in Christ.”  And Arianus said unto him, “Sacrifice to the gods, so that thou\nmayest live”: and Philemon said unto him, “Is not this life death because of the Name of\nChrist?”  And Arianus said unto him, “I will kill thee quickly, before thou canst receive\nbaptism, and that for which thou hopest will be lost to thee.”  When Philemon heard this,\nhe prayed to God to grant to him Christian baptism, and straightway a cloud of light came\nfrom heaven and baptized him.   And Arianus commanded three soldiers to smite\nPhilemon, so that he might be ashamed and repent.  And Philemon said unto him, “I shall\nnot be ashamed, even if thou smite me more severely than this, for I see that the angels of\nGod rejoice because of me.”   And Arianus commanded them to hang him up on a\nframework, and to shoot arrows at him, but not one of them touched him.  And when the\nsoldiers told Arianus that he was still alive, he commanded them to shoot at him again, and\nas he was standing [there] one of the arrows came down into the right eye of Arianus, and\nblinded it.  Then straightway he commanded them to take him down from the framework,\nand to cut off his head and the head of Apollo the reader with the sword, and they finished\ntheir martyrdom patiently.  And Arianus took a little of the blood of these saints and put it\nin his eye, and he recovered his sight, and straightway he believed on Christ.   And he\nreleased all the prisoners, and became a martyr by the hand of Diocletian.  [This section is\nwanting in the Bodleian MS.]\nAnd on this day also died Saint Abba Timothy, the thirty-second Archbishop of the city of\nAlexandria.  To this father and fighter came tribulation, and great trial, because of the True\nFaith.  And Abba Severus, Archbishop of the city of Antioch, came to the country of Egypt\nin those days, and he went about from city to city, and from monastery to monastery, and\nfrom one religious house to another with Abba Timothy, strengthening the believers.  And\nin the days of this father there appeared in Egypt certain evil men who had come from\n\nConstantinople, and who were of those who believed in the opinion of Eutyches, the\nunclean, who confessed the teaching of error and denied the Passion, and the Resurrection\nof Christ our Redeemer, and this father anathematized them, and drove them out of Egypt,\nand he anathematized those who believed in their words.  And in the days of this father\nAnastasius the emperor of the believers died, and Justinianus the infidel, the\nChalcedonian, reigned in his stead; and he made Linarius archbishop in the place of Abba\nTimothy.  And he wished to convert all the men of the True Faith to the evil faith of the\nCouncil of Chalcedon.  And he gathered together a Council in the city of Constantinople,\nand brought there Abba Severus, Archbishop of the city of Antioch, and his bishops from\nthe country of the East, and wanted them to believe in the unclean faith of Chalcedon, but\nthey would not obey him.  And he brought great tribulation upon them, and upon all those\nof the True Faith; and this father sat for sixteen (or, seventeen) years and died in peace. \nSalutation to Severus the lion.\nSalutation to John from whose fingers incense dropped.  Salutation to Jacob, the saint of\nGod, who restored the monasteries.   Salutation to Archbishop Timothy the preacher. \nSalutation to Victor the sun.  Salutation to Eusebius, who after being burnt to death was\nraised up by Uriel, and lived upon earth for seven years. \nAnd on this day also became martyrs Theodore, the son of Basilides, and Abba Kaphes\n(Kefses), and Abba Hephes (Hepes).\nAnd on this day also the birth of Victor the martyr took place.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and Severus marveled when the man called him by his name, for he had no\nknowledge of him whatsoever, [and he knew not how he could tell] what would happen to\nhim before it came to pass.  And then this saint grew up, and performed works of ascetic\nexcellence, and the fame of him and his good renown were noised abroad, And he became\na monk in the monastery of Saint Romanus, and he fought a great fight, and devoted\nhimself wholly to the performance of works of righteousness.  And the fame of him was\nnoised abroad, even as the Holy Gospel saith, “’The city which is built upon a hill cannot\nbe hid” (Matthew v, 14).   And when the Archbishop of the city of Antioch died, the\nbishops and doctors agreed to make this Abba Severus Archbishop of Antioch; and they\nseized him against his will and made him archbishop.   During his office the Church\nflourished in all the ends of the world, for his words reached the heretics in every city, and\nhis voice cut through their roots like a sharp two-edged sword.  Now he only remained in\nhis office for a few days, for the emperor died, and there reigned in his stead another\nemperor, who was an infidel, and who believed in the Council or Chalcedon, and whose\nname was Justinian; now the queen, whose name was Theodora, belonged to the True\nFaith.  And the emperor was afraid of this saint, for [he refused] to enter the unclean faith\n[of Chalcedon], and he would not obey him.  And then the emperor was exceedingly wroth\nwith him, and he imagined that the saint was afraid of him, and would submit to him; but\nthe saint would not hearken to his command, and he was not afraid of his wrath.  And the\nemperor wished to kill him secretly, but the righteous Queen Theodora, knowing this,\nwarned the saint to flee from the face of the emperor, and he went forth secretly.  Now\nGod did not want this saint to die at that time, and He preserved him for the benefit of\nmany.  And he used to go about in the cities and monasteries in the garb of the monk, and\nstrengthen the believers.   And he dwelt in the city of Soka, with a certain rich man, a\nChristian, whose name was Dorotheus.  And he worked many signs and great wonders,\nand he was always teaching the believers and strengthening them in the True Faith.  And at\nlength he died in the city of Soka (sic), and his body was translated afterwards to Dabra\nZegag.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Jacob, the fiftieth Archbishop of the city of\nAlexandria.  This saint was appointed archbishop in the sixteenth (or, seventeenth) year of\nthe reign of the King of Egypt, whose name was Al-Muizz in God, which is being\ninterpreted, “he who is obedient to God,” the brother of the governor, the son of Haron\nRashid (Harun Ar-Rashid).  And in the days of this father the monasteries of the desert of\nScete were restored, and the monks returned to them.  And in his days there was a certain\nman whose name was Macarius, of the city of Neroh, and he came to this father Abba\nJacob, the Archbishop, and besought him to visit his house, and to bless [him] in it, and he\nwent with him.  And the man had a son at that time who had been sick, and had died, and\nhe took him and brought him to Abba Jacob, the Archbishop, and he asked him, saying,\n\n“Have compassion upon me, O my father, for this is my only son and he is dead; I beseech\nthee to pray to God on my behalf.”  And Abba Jacob said unto him, “Fear not, according to\nthy faith so shall it be unto thee.”  And he took the child from him, and embraced him in\nhis bosom, and he prayed over him, and made the sign of the Cross over him, and prayed\nto God on his behalf.  And God received his prayer, and the soul of the boy went back unto\nhim, and he opened his eyes and rose up from the dead.  And the saint gave him to his\nfather and said unto him, “Take thy son.  He was not dead, but sleeping”; and when his\nfather saw this miracle great fear came upon him.   And he gave away one-half of his\npossessions in charity, and he sent orders and had a church built in the city of Jerusalem,\nso that it might be an asylum for those of the True Faith who arrived there.   And\nDionysius, Archbishop of the city of Antioch, came to Mesr (Cairo), and visited the father\nArchbishop Abba Jacob, and he dwelt with him for a few days and [then] returned to his\nown country.  And this father sat upon his archiepiscopal throne for ten years and eight\nmonths, and four days, and he died in peace.\nAnd on this day also are commemorated Darius, and Paul, and Akudures, and Sedna.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father Abba Cyril, the seventy-fifth Archbishop of the\ncity of Alexandria.  This father was of the men of the Fayyum, and he was appointed a\npriest there.  Later he departed from that place and came to the monastery of Saint Victor\nthe martyr, which is outside the city, by the will of the Ethiopians, and dwelt therein for\nmany years, fighting a great fight there.  And the fame of his learning and holiness became\nnoised abroad, and the people seized him against his will and made him Archbishop of\nAlexandria; and he protected his flock with a good protection, and drew up a Canon for\nthe use of priests when they ministered in the church at the times of prayer and\nconsecrations.  And he remained in his office for seven years, two months, and six and\ntwenty days; and he died in peace.  [According to the Bodleian MS, he was surnamed “the\nson of Lakuelakue.”]\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and he begot Zerubbabel, and it was he who built the sanctuary in\nJerusalem with Iyasu (Joshua) (Zechariah iv, 9).  And he prophesied to the unclean one,\nthe King of Persia, and revealed to him the signs of the conquest (?).  And he prophesied\nconcerning the coming of our Lord into Jerusalem riding upon an ass, and upon the foal of\nan ass.  And he prophesied concerning the forty pieces of silver, which Judas received for\nthe betrayal of our Redeemer.  And he prophesied concerning the scattering of the Apostles\non the night of the Crucifixion.  And he prophesied concerning the darkness, which took\nplace on the day of the Crucifixion, and concerning the light, which hid itself.  And he\nprophesied concerning the coming of our Lord in His glory, and concerning the sorrow of\nthe children of Israel who did not believe in Him saying, “And they shall look upon Him\nWhom they have pierced, and they shall mourn Him as [parents] mourn for an only son,\nand there shall be much grief in Jerusalem” (Zechariah xii, 10).  And when the days of his\nprophesying were ended he died in peace and was buried in the graves of the prophets. \nSalutation to Zachariah.\nSalutation to Babnuda.\nAnd on this day is commemorated the consecration of the Church of the Forty Soldiers of\nthe city of Sebastia, who were martyred.  This is the first church, which was built in their\nnames.  The great Saint Basil consecrated it, and he pronounced a discourse upon them\nand many encomiums on that day; and he celebrated a great festival in their honor as it\nwere this day.  Salutation to the consecration of this church.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father, the devoted ascetic and fighter Abba\nPaphnutius.  This father became a monk in his early years, and he fought a great fight, and\ndevoted himself strenuously to the path of the ascetic life, especially in respect of fasting,\nand prayer, and prostrations, and vigils.  When he had finished these good works, God, the\nMost High, commanded him to go into the remote parts of the desert, far away from the\nmonasteries of the monks, and to visit the desert saints, and to write down the story of\ntheir fights for the benefit of those who were to read them, and to make us bow to the\ncommandment of God.  And he went into the interior of the desert, and he traveled about\namong [the saints], even as a man walketh about through the city; and he found many\nmonks there, and he learned from them their histories, and he wrote down the histories of\ntheir fights; among these monks were Timothy, the desert monk, and ‘Abunafer.  At the\nbeginning of his journey into the Inner Desert great tribulation fell upon this Saint\nPaphnutius through hunger, but the angel of God appeared unto him and strengthened him;\nnow he was seventeen days without food.  And after this he hungered, and dew nigh unto\ndeath, and the angel of God appeared unto him again and rubbed his body and his mouth,\nand he again remained for seventeen days without food.  And this saint related very many\nwonderful things about the desert fathers, and how that some of them had lived for sixty\nyears, and more, in the desert, without ever seeing a man during the whole period of these\ndays.  And he described also the tribulation of the desert monks when they first arrived\n\nthere, and the sufferings which they had endured on their first entrance into the desert, and\nhow their natural passions contended with them, and how unclean spirits made war on\nthem, and how afterwards they subdued them, and how the spirits submitted to them, and\nworshipped at their feet.  And likewise the wild beasts and the lions used to minister to\ntheir wants, and he described how they submitted to them, like a slave to his master.  And\nhe related concerning them that they used to receive the Holy Mysteries on the day\npreceding the Sabbath, and on the First Day of the week, and how the angel of God used to\nbring to them the Holy Body and Honorable Blood, and give them of the fruits of the\nGarden.  And it is evident that this father saw and heard marvelous things; and after this he\ndied in peace.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and he begot three daughters.  By kin she was the daughter\nof the sister of the mother of our Lady Mary, the mother of God in the flesh.  The name of\nthe eldest was Mary, and she it was who was the mother of Salome, who received our\nLady Mary when she brought forth the Wonder.  The name of the second was Sophia, and\nshe it was who was the mother of this Saint Elisabeth.  The name of the youngest was\nHannah, who brought forth our Lady Mary; Salome, and Elisabeth, and our Lady Mary\nwere sisters; and Zachariah the priest married this righteous woman Elisabeth.  And the\nHoly Gospel saith concerning them that they were righteous and pure, both of them, and\nthat they walked in all the Law of God blamelessly, and that this righteous woman was\nbarren.   And because of the frequent entreaties of this woman and her husband, their\npetition reached God together, and God gave them a son, Saint John the Baptist, so that He\nmight make manifest their righteousness and their love for God, and the greatness of their\nFaith in Him.  Because God did not grant them their petition early in their lives, this did\nnot cause doubt or sorrow, on the contrary, they were persistent in their petitioning, and at\nlength when they had become old in their days, and were barren, they produced a son, so\nthat [men] might know the Divine Power.  And moreover, when the time arrived wherein\nour holy Lady the Virgin Mary conceived the Word of God Who existeth for ever, John,\nbeing in his mother’s womb, preached Him, and he bowed before Him, even as his mother\nsaith, “The child leaped in my womb with joy and gladness when our Lady Mary came to\nme.”   And when she and her husband Zachariah were grown old, God sent His angel\nGabriel, and announced to him concerning his son John, and informed him what would\nhappen to him.   And this Saint Elisabeth conceived and brought forth the saint, the\nprophet, the preacher and Baptist John; and her heart rejoiced at this, and the reproach of\nthe children of her kinsfolk was removed from her.   And then she saw our Lord and\nRedeemer Jesus Christ, and confessed His Godhead, and she rejoiced in making to be\nsaved those who believed on Him.  And after this she lived in purity and righteousness\neven as she had formerly done, and she died in peace.  Salutation to Elisabeth.\nAnd on this day also is commemorated our holy Lady Mary, the two-fold Virgin, the God-\nbearer, for on it He gave her the Covenant of Mercy and she received it from her Son, our\nRedeemer Jesus Christ, in respect of him that should celebrate her commemoration, or\nshould call upon her name, or give alms to the poor, even if it were only [a cup of] cold\nwater.  And the Son of this Saint Mary after He ascended into heaven, taking her pure flesh\n[with Him], sat down at the right hand of His Father, having fulfilled every law of the\nIncarnation, with the sole exception of sin, and overcome the sufferings of the Cross at His\nown good pleasure and will, which He did for our salvation.  And He left His mother Mary\nin the house of John, His disciple, so that he might love her, even as He committed him to\nher, saying, “Behold thy son,” and He said unto that disciple, “Behold thy mother.” \nThereupon our Lady Mary lived [there], and she used to go to the tomb of her Son, that is\nto say, Golgotha, to pray there.  And when the Jews saw [her] there they were filled with\nwrath, and envy, and they wished to drive her away; but God hid her from their eyes. \nThen they took counsel, and decided to set guards over His tomb, so that she might not\ncome there again and pray, but she did not cease to go there day by day, and the guards did\nnot see her, because the covering of the glory of her Son hid her.  And always angels were\ncoming to minister unto her, and her Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, visited her frequently, and\nfulfilled for her all her desires.  Some of the angels used to take her up into the heavens\nand show her the places where the saints rested, with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  And all\nthe souls of the fathers who had died from Adam until that time worshipped her, saying,\n\n“Glory be to God, Who hath created thee flesh of our flesh, and bone of our bone.  In thee\nwe have found salvation, and thou hast become for us the haven of life from destruction\nthrough the Son of God taking upon Himself flesh through thee.”  And then the angels\ntook her, and brought her to her beloved Son on His throne, and the curtains, which were\nflames of fire, were drawn aside on the right hand and on the left, and our Lord took her\nhand, and kissed her mouth, and said unto her, “Hast thou arrived, O my mother?”  And\nHe raised her up on to the throne of His glory, and He seated her by Him, and He\ndescribed to her all the joy and gladness which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard of, nor\nheart of man imagined, which were prepared for her.  And beneath the throne of glory she\nsaw David, the King of Israel, her father, (with all the company of the prophets, and the\nangels, and the souls of the righteous, in a circle,) singing to the harp, saying, “Hearken\nunto me, my daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear.   Forget thy people and thy\nfather’s house.  The king hath desired thy beauty; he is thy Lord” (Psalm xlv).  And from\nthere the angels took her to show her the place of punishment, and they brought her to the\nlimit of darkness, which is prepared for Satan and his hosts, and for all those who walk in\nhis ways.  And our Lady Mary said, “Woe is me !  Who will describe this place to the\nchildren of men, so that they may not come hither?”  And the angel said unto her, “Fear\nthou not, O Mary, God is with thee, and for thy sake with those who shall come after\nthee.”  And then the angels carried her away and brought her into a certain place, and\nthereupon our Lady Mary sat down, being exceedingly sorry for all sinners.  And as it\nmight be this day the sixteenth day of the month of Yakatit, she stood on the Place of the\nSkull (Golgotha), and besought her Son, saying, “O my Son, swear to me by God Thy\nFather, and by Thy Name of Christ, and [by] the Paraclete, Thy Spirit, and by my womb\nwhich carried Thee for nine months and five days, Thee Whom the earth cannot bear up,\nThee Whom the angels cannot approach, I adjure Thee, O my Son, by Thy going forth\nfrom me without exhaustion, and by Thy delivery which was painless, I adjure Thee by my\nbreasts which suckled Thee, and by my lips which kissed Thee, I adjure Thee by my hands\nwhich embraced Thee, and by my feet which walked with Thee, I adjure Thee by the\nmanger wherein Thou didst lie, and by the ragged cloths wherein Thou wast wrapped, O\nmy Son, and Beloved One, I beseech Thee, and entreat Thee, to hearken unto the words of\nmy petition, and to come to me, and to fulfill for me everything which is in my heart.” \nAnd when our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the mother of the Light, had spoken thus, our\nLord and Redeemer Jesus Christ came down straightway, and there were with Him,\nsurrounding Him, thousands of thousands, and tens of thousands of tens of thousands of\nangels, and he said unto her, “What shall I do for thee, Mary, My mother?  What desire\nhast thou that thou wouldst have Me fulfill for thee?”  And our Lady the holy Virgin Mary\nanswered and said unto her beloved Son, “O my Beloved Son, my Lord and Redeemer, my\nHope, my Refuge, upon Thee is placed my trust.  Because of Thee I was strong in the\nwomb of my mother, and in the womb which covered Thee, and Thou art my memorial, at\nall times.  And now do Thou hear my prayer and petition, and hearken unto the word of\nmy mouth which I speak unto Thee.  I Thy mother Mary, I Thine handmaiden, on behalf of\nhim that shall celebrate my commemoration, and him that shall build a church in my\nname, or shall clothe the naked, or visit the sick, or feed the hungry, or give drink to him\nthat is athirst, or shall comfort the sorrowful, or shall make the sad to rejoice, or shall write\nthe history of my strife, or shall sing a song at my festival; [swear to me] that God shall\ngive him the good reward from Thee, which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard of, nor the\nheart of man imagined.  I beseech and entreat Thee on behalf of all those who believe in\nme, to set them free from Sheol, and to remember the hunger, and thirst, and all the trials\nwhich came upon me through Thee.”  And our Lord Jesus Christ answered and said unto\nher, “It shall be unto thee even as thou sayest, and I will fulfill for thee all thy petition; I\nbecame incarnate of thee, and I swear that I will not make any covenant with thee to be a\nlie.”  Salutation to thee, O Book of the Law and Covenant, like the Tables of stone.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and he was humble,\nand simple, and loved to live by himself.  One day there came into his cell a certain elder,\nwhose name was Maximus to be blessed by him, and Gabriel prayed over him and he went\nforth to depart to his own place.  And the holy elder Maximus laid hold upon him, and said\nunto him, “O my son, why dost thou flee from men, for thou wilt be obliged to dwell\namong many men and women”; and this father did not understand the meaning of the\nwords of the elder, and he wept frequently, and entreated God to deliver him from the nets\nof the Enemy.  And when Abba Michael, the Archbishop, his predecessor, died, they seized\nthis father and against his will made him archbishop, even as the elder had prophesied\nconcerning him.  And having been appointed he did not become slothful in his office, and\nhe did not abandon his spiritual fight, or his strenuous ascetic life, nor his piety; and he\ndwelt continually in the desert of Scete.  And when affairs connected with the work of the\nchurches compelled him to go to the city of Alexandria and to Mesr (Cairo), he used to go\nquickly, and return to the desert of Scete.  When he was in the youth of his days the lust\nfor fornication used to bestir itself in him, and [although] he increased his fasts and vigils\nin order to subdue the lust, he was unable to do so; and he confessed this to a certain elder\nin the desert of Scete.  And that elder said unto him, “Nothing will destroy lust except\nhumility, coupled with fasting, and prayer, and prostration, and vigils, and those alone will\nsave [a man] form it.”  When he heard this he made himself a shovel of iron, and he used\nto get up in the night and dress himself in mean and ragged garments, and go round into all\nthe cells of the monks, and clear out the offal from them and take it away, and cast it out at\na great distance from the cells.  And he continued to do this kind of work for a period of\ntwo years, when God saw his purity and the humility of his heart and removed from him\nthe natural lust for fornication.  And this father continued to lead the ascetic life and to\nfight the fight, and he admonished and taught his people, and strengthened them in the\nTrue Faith for a period of eleven years; and he died in peace.  Salutation to Gabriel for his\nrighteousness and faith.\nAnd on this day also died the holy father, Abba Zachariah, Bishop of the city of Saha. \nThis saint was one of the children of those skilled in the Law, and his father abandoned the\nLaw, and was made a priest; and his name was John.   And when the son of John had\ngrown up, and had studied the profane learning and the philosophy of the pagans, and the\nLaw of the Church, the captain of the king’s host took him and made him a scribe in the\nhouse of the king.  And he had a friend in the Law, whose name was Ptolemy, and who\nwas governor of the city of Saha; and they agreed together to go to the desert of Scete and\nto become monks.  And at that time there visited them a certain monk from the monastery\nof Saint Abba John of the desert of Scete, and they made an agreement to go there with\nhim; and when the governors heard of this they sent and prevented their going.   And\nhaving tarried a few days they saw a vision, and it seemed as if one said unto them, “Why\ndo you not fulfill the vow which ye have vowed to God?\nAnd they rose up straightway, and went forth in secret, but they did not know the way, and\na monk appeared unto them and guided them, and brought them to the monastery of Saint\nAbba John, of the desert of Scete.  And when the governors heard of their departure, they\nagreed that they would obtain an order from the king and send it with messengers to make\n\nthem to come down from the monastery; but God scattered their counsel.   And when\nZachariah and Ptolemy had become monks, they fought the fight and followed the ascetic\nlife strenuously, especially Zachariah.  And in their days lived the elders Abba Abraham\nand Abba Ga’Argi, and they used to visit the young men, and give them advice concerning\nall their works.  When the Bishop of the city of Soha died, the people remembered Saint\nAbba Zachariah, and they wrote a letter to the archbishop on his behalf, asking him to\nappoint him to be their bishop.  And the archbishop sent to the desert of Scete and had\nZachariah brought against his will, and he appointed him Bishop of the city of Soha.  And\nwhilst the archbishop was laying his hand upon him, he saw the power of God descend\nupon him, and his face was wreathed with light.  And when he came to the throne of his\noffice the people rejoiced in him with great joy, and they went out to meet him as [the men\nof old] met our Redeemer on the festival of Hosanna {Palm Sunday); and the Church was\nresplendent through him.   And this father composed many Homilies, and Admonitions,\nand works on Doctrine; and his voice was exceedingly sweet, and was filled with the grace\nof the Holy Ghost.  And he sat upon his archiepiscopal throne forty years, and he was\nwell-pleasing to God and died in peace.  Salutation to Zachariah.\nAnd on this day also Saint Onesimus, the priest, and the disciple of Paul the apostle,\nbecame a martyr.   When Paul the apostle had preached in the city of Rome, Philemon\ndeparted from the city of Rome and took with him among his servants this Onesimus.  And\nSatan led him into error and corrupted his heart, and he stole money from his master\nPhilemon and from other men like him; and when he knew that his master was going to\npunish him, he fled and came to the city of Rome.  By the Will of God he came to the\napostle, and heard his teaching, and his teaching entered his heart, and he believed through\nhim, and the fear of God came into his heart.  And he remembered what he had done, and\nhow he had stolen money from his master and from others, and he had nothing of it left\nwith him, which he could restore to them of their money.  And he was sorry, and he came\nto Saint Paul and told him everything which had happened to him.  And the apostle said\nunto him, “Fear not, neither let thy heart be sorrowful.”  And he wrote an epistle unto\nPhilemon his master; and this epistle is one of the Epistles of the Apostle Paul.  And Paul\ncommanded him concerning Saint Onesimus, and he said unto him, “Protect him, for he\nhath become a disciple of Christ, and my son in the preaching of the Gospel.”  And he\ncommanded him concerning Onesimus, and said unto him, “Forgive him his sin in stealing\nthy money, and receive him as myself.  And if he hath wronged thee in aught, and he ought\nto repay thee, set it to my account.  I, Paul, have written it with mine own hand; howbeit I\nsay not that thou art thyself in debt to me.”  And when this Saint Onesimus came with the\nletter to his master Philemon, he rejoiced in his faith and repentance, and did to him even\nas the Apostle Paul had commanded him.   And Philemon added to his great love for\nOnesimus, and he commanded [his steward to give] to him much money for him to take,\nand he would take nothing whatsoever of it, and he said, “I have become a rich man in\nChrist.”   And when Philemon bade Onesimus farewell, and set him on his road, and\nOnesimus returned to the city of Rome, and ministered unto Paul, the Apostle, until the\ntime of his martyrdom.   And Paul praised this saint and made him a priest, and the\nApostles praise him and mention him in the seventy-seventh Canon, and in the fifty-third\nCanon, and they say of him that he was a “faithful priest.”  And after the martyrdom of the\nApostle Paul, the captain of the host of the Emperor of Rome took this saint, and banished\nhim to an island, and he dwelt there and taught the men the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ. \nAnd they beat him severely and made him to suffer agony, and then they broke his thighs,\nand he departed to God.  Salutation to Onesimus the disciple of Paul.\nAnd on this day also died Abba Peter, Bishop of Damascus.\n[And on this day also died Abba ‘Akyos, and Abba Gabriel, Bishop of Ethiopia.]\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and he fasted frequently and he prayed and kept vigil ceaselessly.  And he used to\nfeed himself daily on the wasted lupines, after he had fasted from dawn until sunset. \nWhen he wanted to fight against sleep he ate for a period of eighty days ashes mixed with\nlupines, and his strength was increased whilst he was fighting the fight of the ascetic fight,\nand he ministered to the wants of the company of the monks, and called them his masters. \nAnd he carried out to perfection every practice and observance of the ascetic life, and God\nwrought many great signs and miracles by him, among which are the following:   He\nhealed a certain maiden of a sickness, with which she had been sick for many years;\nthrough the severity of her sickness she was dried up like wood, and the physicians were\nunable to heal her.  By his prayer he slew a huge serpent, which had destroyed many men. \nHe drove off from men and from lions, unclean spirits, and many severe and painful\ndiseases.  And Lekatinu the governor heard of his devotion to God, and his excellences,\nand his righteousness, and the strength of his body, and he had him brought against his will\nto Kuerh, and he made him a soldier in his army against his will.  But he ceased not to\ndevote himself to ascetic practices, and to fasting and prayer, nay he even added to his\npractice of righteousness and ascetic excellence.  And he remained [a soldier] for a few\ndays only, for God blotted out Diocletian, the infidel, and the righteous and God-loving\nEmperor Constantine reigned [in his stead].   And this saint tried to find a pretext for\nleaving the army and the service of the emperor.   Now by the Will of our Lord Jesus\nChrist, there was with Constantine a certain young man who was of goodly appearance,\nand whose deeds were good, and the emperor loved him exceedingly.  And Satan the Evil\nOne took possession of the young man, and tortured him very severely, and the young man\ncried out by day and by night.  And when one of those who knew Saint Agapetus saw him,\nhe said unto him, “O youth, if thou couldst obtain the help of Saint Agapetus, he would\nheal thee of thy sickness.”   And the youth said unto him, “Is it possible for a man to\nattempt to do this being only a soldier in the Imperial Army?”  And the friend of Agapetus\ntold the youth all about his spiritual fight, and his righteousness, and said unto him, “Verily\nhe is able to heal thee of thy sickness.”  And the young man cried out, saying, “Bring\nhither to me Saint Agapetus, the soldier, that he may heal me of this severe sickness.”  And\nwhen the emperor knew this he commanded his servants to bring Saint Agapetus, and\nwhen he had come before him he prayed over the young man, and made over him the sign\nof the Honorable Cross, and God healed him of his sickness.  And the emperor rejoiced in\nthis with great joy, and he paid great honor to the saint, and he said unto him, “Lay upon\nme whatsoever thou wishest me to pay, and I will do so.”  And the saint said unto him,\n“Release me from military service,” and the emperor released him, and sent him away, and\nthe saint returned to the place wherein he had lived formerly.  And he lived by himself, and\ndevoted himself to God and to spiritual fighting, which was much more severe than\nformerly, for many years; and the bishop of the neighboring city made him a priest.  And\nwhen that bishop died, the people asked the archbishop to make Agapetus their bishop, and\nhe did so.  And Agapetus shepherded his rational flock carefully and well, and God gave\nhim the gift of prophecy, and the gift of working many signs and wonders.   And he\nrebuked sinners for committing sin in secret, and he rebuked the priests for forsaking the\nteaching of the people; and he rebuked them and repelled them from the sanctuary until\nthey repented.  And it is found written in the history of his strife that during his lifetime he\nperformed one hundred miracles, and among them he made a river to stop flowing, and by\n\nmeans of his cross turned it into another bed.  And he opened the eyes of a blind man, and\ncleansed a leper, and healed many sick folk, and then he died in peace.\nAnd on this day also [Timothy, of the city of Gaza, and] Saint Matyas, of the city of\nCyprus, became martyrs.  Salutation to [Timothy, of Gaza], and to Matyas (Minas ?), of\nthe city of Cyprus.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",

and his house was left a heap of waste, with the exception\nof the porch, which had no doors (?), and the pilgrims used to live there.  And at that time\ntwo men who were poor in respect of money, but rich in the matter of the Faith, went to\nJerusalem to worship, and to fast the Holy Fast (i.e. Lent).  Now this took place many\nyears later.  And when the evening was come they went and dwelt in the ruined house of\nHerod, and Saint John appeared unto one of them in a dream, and told him his name, and\nthe place wherein was his head; and he commanded him to take it and carry it to his house;\nwhen the man woke up from his dream, he told his companion what he had seen.  And\nthey rose up together, and came to that place which Saint John had pointed out to him, and\nthey found a vessel therein.  And when they had opened it, there ascended to them the odor\nof a perfume, which was very pleasant, and they found in it the holy head of Saint John,\nand they were blessed thereby.  And they put it back into the vessel, and fastened up the\nmouth thereof, as it was at first, and the man took it with him to his house, and paid it very\ngreat honor, and kept a lamp burning before it continually.  And when death drew nigh\nunto that man he told his sister about the holy head, and commanded her to treat it as he\nhad done; and she paid honor to the holy head, and kept a lamp burning before it.  And the\nhead of Saint John was handed on from man to man, until at length it came to a certain\nman who was an Arian, and who thought that the head would perform miracles for him,\nalthough he was of the faith of Arius, the infidel.  And Saint John raised up against him a\nman who was greater than he, and this man drove him away from that place, and that place\nlay waste until Abba Cyril was made Bishop of Jerusalem, and Abba Anianus Bishop of\nthe city of Khamd.  And Saint John appeared unto Abba Anianus during his sleep, and told\nhim the place wherein was his holy head, and Abba Anianus went and fetched it up, as it\nwere on this day, the thirtieth day of the month Ginbot.  This is the second time they found\nit--on the thirtieth day of the month Yakatit.\nAnd John, the Mouth of Gold (i.e. Chrysostom), saith something different to this, that is to\nsay:  When Herod commanded the soldiers, and they had cut off the head of the saint\nwhilst he was in prison, they brought it to him, and he gave it to the daughter of Herodias\non a platter.  And when that unclean harlot touched it, the hair of the head stood up, and\nthe holy head leaped up into the air, and was crying out and saying, “It is not right for thee\nto take thy brother’s wife,” and it continued to fly about like an eagle, and to utter these\nwords for a period of fifteen years, when it ceased and was buried in the Sea of Arabia. \nAnd the pilgrims used to dwell in that place.  And by the Will of God there came to that\n\nplace two righteous and believing pilgrims, who were brothers, and they dwelt in that\nplace.  And Saint John appeared unto them, and told them to take up his holy head.  And\nthey took up his head from that place, and they carried it away with them to their house,\nand paid it great honor.  Salutation to thy head, O Saint John.\nGlory be to God Who is glorified in His Saints.  Amen.",
